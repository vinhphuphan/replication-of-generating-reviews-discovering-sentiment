"This hotel, The Colorado Bell, is so bad. It desperately needs to be renovated and cleaned. I cannot even begin to say how bad, dirty, old and smelly it was. We just stayed there this last weekend. I felt like I had to hold my breath and did not want to touch any of the walls in the hallway walking... More",0
"We had not been to David's in a while, not since we had small children and made use of the babysitting service. PROS: The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The live music quite good. My Hendricks and tonic was so tasty that I had another. My wife and I both enjoyed the sesame crusted lobster and sea scallops with savory... More",1
"The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ.

"This is our first time at the Bowling Green Drury Inn. We stayed at one previously and really like the service, rooms, kickback dinner and breakfast buffet that Drury offers. After a long day traveling, it is nice to kickback and not have to look for a place to eat. Salad, soup, options to make a simple dinner, plus nacho... More",1
Pictures must've been old. I got what I paid for....somewhere to lay my head and shower late at night from long drive. Only good thing is they put us where it was quieter. Stairwell and walkways were not renovated and smelled like urine.,0
"Hotel is dated room was fine. Convenient for a race in downtown st. Louis for an out of tower. Was called several times prior to stay, and called after stay which got annoying. The after stay phone call was trying to sell me on additional stays at other hotels. I found this incredibly frustrating. I have never had this happen with any other hotel I have booked through here.",1
Good: The serviceminded staff in the reception (specially Maria),1
"We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for the LSU game at the Dome. It was a wonderful surprise! It was an easy walk to the Dome from the hotel. The hotel was beautiful! Our room and the bed was fantastic! The staff couldnt have been nicer or more accommodating! We couldnt have been more pleased. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to The Big Easy!!Thank you for choosing NOPSI! It's a pleasure to learn the numerous things that made your time with us unforgettable. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
I loved everything about this hotel. It was clean and the staff was pretty darn awesome. Great dining experience and the hotel shuttle was fast and convenient. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone on business or leisure!!,1
Amazing hotel! Great location! Starbucks and lots of restaurants were right down the road. The hotel has been newly renovated so everything is nice and new. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was that housekeeping came by at 9am. A little too early in my opinion. But overall I give this place 5 stars!,1
"Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi. I would stay again however its expensive a bottle of water in the room is about 6 dollars, drank in error not understanding it was a cost option. drink iced water in reception, very nice.",1
"Staff at Front Desk VERY helpful and friendly and helpful with the area information,",1
"Great location, a few steps from the beach which was lovely and all the restaurants and bars. The room had been renovated but very cheaply and the room smelt very musty. The bed was comfortable and the staff friendly. Parking space was available as requested.",1
Bad: no need Karaoke club. Good: Clean and comfortable facilities,1
Very good stay with lots of energy.,1
"Visited Charleston with friends for a quick getaway. Once you reach the Indigo and park your car, you can walk anywhere in the historic area. Located near the market, restaurants, museums, carriage tours. We had a great time. The Indigo is a historic building, and is well cared for. Rooms are small but well appointed and arranged(and clean!), breakfast is... More",1
It was wonderful.,1
Very pleasant experience. Comfortable room and clean conditions. Got a great rate for the night.,1
"This is the best in that price I've ever had. We stayed in room 807 ,The room was big,clean,and comfortable, everything is good for us.",1
We were meeting family in Baltimore/near the stadium. It was so nice for the hotel to shuttle us to the light rail which then took us to Camden Yards. Was nice not to worry about parking and driving. thank you!,1
relaxing. The diner could be a little cleaner but otherwise good.,1
"We stayed at the Allatoona Inn's lake home. We were very disappointed that the house was quite a walk from the lake, not on the lake, as advertised. The lake is beautiful but we were not able to use it as not all of the people in our group could make the walk to the beach. The house, although cute,... More",0
The bell hop and guest service was good until after I checked in and shift change I asked the next one on duty of there was room available and she said no for more family was gonna get a room there while sitting at the bar I watched a couple walk in off the street and ask if there was rooms available and low and behold they were rented a room,1
"Hotel is very affordable, considering its a well kept hotel, in a very nice area, just outside a major city (with hotels 4 times the price near by). Easy access to and from the highways, and just a few blocks from the Metro and MARC stations. Highly recommend and will definitely consider staying here again.",1
"Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient. Also the breakfast at 6 and if you need to go before that, they give you a breakfast baggie to go, very thoughtful! Close to the airport and to Jersey Gardens Mall! I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure.",1
"The owner/operator take good care of this property. The room was clean and very reasonable, especially for the relatively low price they charge. The breakfast was free and have enough variety to satisfy most visitors. Compared to the price they charge for similar motels in the nearby Colfax, the price of this motel was almost half. It is a 25... More",1
When we walked into our room we found bugs dead and alive in the room. When we searched further we found more dead bugs. They should do a better job of vacuuming the rooms including behind beds tv and fridge.,0
From all outside appearance this facility is closed for remodeling as well as restaurants. Great location. Hope it is open on my next visit to NOLA. Lots of eating places in the area. Have to do minimum of 200 characters but not sure what more I can add to IT'S CLOSED!!!!,0
"We stayed for three nights at the West Street hotel after experiencing two disappointing nights at another hotel. The staff here was wonderful and helpful. The amenities were amazing. We loved the rooftop pool and the views! amenities included the Bar Harbor Club which housed a workout room, and sauna. It was wonderful.",1
"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful.",1
"Hard to say what I felt about this place. I came up and got a room with a balcony overlooking the river which was pretty awesome. Price was great too, can't beat 20 bucks. But the rooms were kind of weird. Old and outdated I guess. TV old and skippy. Can't imagine having to pay more than 20 dollars, I'm... More",0
Bad: nothing to complain about. staff very helpful. Good: bed extra comfy,1
Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel.,1
Had a great time downtown Public transportation was great,1
"This was def not the worst place I have ever stayed but there was a inch or more gap under the door, pet rooms are on the back side of the hotel next to what could possibly be Tenn, grodiest swimming pool. Highway noise was extremely high and the pool had a malfunction which had it making tons of racket... More",0
"I stayed over cuz I had a work event on the same night as the Cubs being in the World Series and didn't want to drive back home. Worked for what I needed but word of the wise it's closer to Alexandria vs DC proper so plan accordingly. But staff was very helpful. I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room).",1
"We stayed for one night while attending a wedding. Cons: The AC in the room had to be set to 62* from the air to work at all. Even set at 62*, the room felt 70-72*. The bathroom is very dated. The shower/tub didn't work properly. And there is no light specifically for the shower room. There is one switch that controls both the vanity and the shower. No continental breakfast. You're only option is (overpriced) Minerva's. Pros: Very nice staff. The rooms are very clean. It's near Thunder Road.",1
"Arriving at this hotel we had an open mind, this surely changed within the next hour of our stay. We checked in at roughly 10 PM, this process took a drooling 15 minutes at least. The two staff members had a hard time finding my reservation that was booked 3 days before through Hotels.com. We finally received our key, drove... More",0
everything was fine until my check out. i had the comeback at home with out money for a error on the front desk staff ..they block my credit card .after many charges.. and i had the pay on cash my last cash to return at home for they mistake and they didn't even apologize..front desk supervisor was totally rude..tours me...

"The room was spacious. The bed, however was hard and uncomfortable as well as the air conditioner being very noisy. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. It was nice to have a service that took you back and forth to the airport.",1
Good: We loved our stay at this hotel. All the staff specially the people in the front desk were extremely nice. Our room was very clean. Bed was really comfortable. The pool area was very relaxing. We had the hotel breakfast twice and both days it was fresh and tasty. We were also able to see magic kingdoms fire work show from the outside of our room because it was facing the park.,1
We visited with family and the hotel was extremely accomodating,1
Rooms were very clean. Staff was very helpful. Hotel in walking distance to restaurants in little Italy. Suggest using parking lot behind hotel. Parking is about 10 compared to hotel valet at 35,1
"Phantastic location in Charleston Historic District. The hotel comes along with ""Sothern Comfort"" and a historic 18th Century flair mixed with modern amenities. Shoping and dining locations are a few yards around the corner in King Street and Market Street. Charlestons historic houses start right across the street going south on Meeting Street. Definitely a great destination to stay at for a Charleston visit!!!",1
"We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach.",1
"I coordinate the logistics concerning work space, food and sleeping rooms for a NYC based law firm. These teams usually average around 25 people. I had the pleasure of working with Kristin Munafo in sales and later with Rita Fowler the conference services manager. Both ladies could not have been more professional and accommodating. Matt Konrad the A/V manager made... More",1
"If you love luxury, impeccably clean rooms, stunning art, and eclectic eateries, than this place is for you.

More",1
"Friendly staff, nice clean room, good hot breakfast",1
Loved it,1
"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious.",1
"Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing.",1
The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..,1
"I was on a long stay for work in the area and the staff is great.. treated us like family, rooms were clean, has a place to do laundry and plenty of near by restaurants. They do offer breakfast and do have open wifi but the wifi is much to be desired as it does need to be faster to... More",1
My wife and I spent three days at the Cub while we hiked in the park. It is off the beaten path and away from the crazy traffic and prices of Gatlinburg. It's like staying at Moms house. Older charming style with a beautiful view of the park to the south. We chose the King suites overlooking the mountain stream.... More,1
"Stayed for Baseball Spring Training @ 140 CAD., the free WIFI is a total Joke, no reception at all in the room and very limited in lobby and kept logging off, we have 4 devices so I know it was not the device. I asked if I can pay for wifi to get better reception, was told that's all they offer.The pool has problems as it's leaking all over the place outside, twice there and no towels, when asked for towel, they only brought 2 towels. If you don't get the room service by 10 am, they won't come back.Room was clean but little small for 4 people.",1
"Well maintained facilities, courteous staff, as you expect in the Hilton chain. close proximity to BWI airport great weekend rate, at least that weekend.",1
Went down for breakfast and there was none left. What they did have was terrible. Comforter on bed was dirty.,0
"Surprised by the quality of this hotel-very clean well furnished rooms , professional and friendly staff-no complaints. It was very quiet and convenient. Very central location from which to visit Mt. Dora and other destinations.",1
"At the spur of the moment we decided to spend a weekend in Gloucester. There was not many choices but we have stayed at Hampton Inns before and knew of the great quality. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and the bed...MoreThank you for your recent review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are pleased that you selected our hotel on the spur of the minute and that your stay was pleasant. Please come again soon!",1
"I would give it an excellent rating only the villas are slightly dated and worn (but very clean.) But, aside from that, it's perfect. Fireplaces, views, full kitchen, walk to the creek, walk to uptown, clean and beautiful spa area with great attention to details. The staff is helpful and polite.",1
"We enjoyed a great stay at La Quinta and would stay here again for the value and proximity to the fwy! Overall, a great value for the price!! Good sized guestroom and bathroom. It was clean and quiet. And we enjoyed the variety of breakfast item's that were served buffet style!!",1
Bad: Advertising there is a casino but their isn't this should be updated so that customers are aware prior to booking. Also our room had an old moldy non working refrigerator. Good: Staff was nice,0
"Bad: Spa (No pool and No available time). Breakfast. Good: Breakfast wasn't ready. No coffee, no plates, nothing in the hot thing. Really a disapointment.",0
"Clean... Comfortable. Serve meals and wine or beer for dinner Monday thru thurs. buffet breakfast. Staff is friendly. Laundry on property and basic no frills gym. Treadmill, elliptical and a set of free weights. I stay frequently for business.",1
"This all suite hotel is just perfect. The staff is very friendly, helpful and attentive. The room was fantastic. 750 square feet of pure luxury with a view of downtown la and more. The furnishings were stylish, mid-century/modern mix. The bathroom was like having our own private spa in our room. All white tile with a soaking tub for two.... More",1
Three fire alarms over 2 nights was unusual for this hotel. Try the mocha machine in the breakfast area.,1
Very very very disappointed in the happy hour. Lines were extremely long 10 to 12 people at a time. Very difficult to get a drink. Bartender was waiting on entire bar plus our seating area plus customers who wanteddrinks. The drinks may as well not have been free. Snacks were sparse and not replenished.,1
"We came for one night to go to a Lions game, the staff were great and very friendly, the rooms were spacious, renovated and amazing. Nikita at the breakfast restaurant downstairs was perfect. we would come back again. If you are a non-smoker, be careful of you go to the casino, most people smoke and the smoke is overwhelming....but the... More",1
We stayed here last Friday before July 4th to see a show at 1st Avenue. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are great. Their beds are very comfortable and the location you can't beat. Whether you're going to a Twins game or going to see a show around the downtown area it's a great place to stay. The... More,1
"When we arrived, we thought that the pool would suffice as our main form of entertainment, but since the pool was packed beyond belief, we were forced to find other forms of entertainment. I found the tiny arcade, and I got very lucky winning a ton of tickets and getting a ton of prizes, but the tokens are still very... More",1
Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!,1
"Great place to stay! They have everything you need for an extended stay or just one night. All the comforts of home. Good for a family or just by yourself. My son goes to college in Beverly,Mass and I have stayed at another hotel here, but this will be my go to for now on when I'm dropping him off... More",1
"The whole experience was fantastic, very enjoyable and relaxing. All of the staff were super to deal with. The drinks were good and the food was super. Having a paper each day was very good along with excellent internet service.",1
"Came to area to visit Washington D C, Mt. Vernon and monticello without having to drive everywhere. Although we drove to mt Vernon one day and Monticello on the way home it was nice not having to drive into DC to find a place to park.",1
"This is such a great hotel! The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to be helpful! A great place to put your feet up to relax. Rooms are clean and spacious! It is close to shopping, restaurants and the airport. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO IS COMING TO FORT MYERS!",1
"Love the OMNI for many reasons, the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air (the pool, balconies, front door entrance). Rules need to be enforced, rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas.",1
"We stayed at Disney Saratoga Springs for 7 nights in March 2015. Generally, we really enjoyed our stay. We only went to Downtown Disney twice, but it was a vert easy walk and if we had gone more often, the proximity would be a real plus. The bus ride to the various parks could be a little long and we... More",1
"Bad: The breakfast was not good. I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Good: Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see.",1
"Hotel was functional. Stayed for one night and glad it wasn't any longer. Check in was easy and efficient. Parking is directly behind the hotel. There is a tiny little alley that you wouldn't notice on the left side on the hotel, there are about 10 parking spaces and it's first come first serve. This is a very industrial neighborhood....

Stayed at a couple around the same area. This was the best.,1
Bad: Expensive but all of south beach is. . Good: Location,1
"The hotel is at the best location, convenient for shopping, hiking, or simply relaxing. The breakfast (included) is incredibly good and generous. Free village parking and transportation are just a few steps away. Overall, a great deal.",1
Beach service very good. Umbrella and chairs set up by staff. Beach great.,1
You get what you pay for. I will leave it at that.,0
"Everything was good except for the occasional loud neighbors. The air conditioner had a hard time keeping the room at a constant temperature. The bed was comfy for a non memory foam bed, the shower pressure was good.Thank you for your helpful feedback. We appreciate your business.",1
This hotel is a splendid option for anyone who is to leave on a bus from the downtown area and looking for an inexpensive way to spend their last night in the city. They even offer a free YMCA pass if you want to use the facilities across the street. It was a very comfortable stay and the staff made... More,1
"Quick check in, clean and comfortable large room. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Complimentary breakfast was excellent for this type of hotel. My only suggestion is that they please stock some plain black tea (only flavored teas were available). All staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming.",1
"Rude man at check in, no cable or internet for 1 1/2 days, dirty sheets, staff not helpful, no coffee, horrible stay!!",0
"Last minute late night Stay. Hampton Inn claimed no room reserved , yet had the conference room which was done at the same time! This was an awesome find and best suited to extended stay and families. Being a business traveler it was wasted space and added comforts that we did not have the time to enjoy. Would stay here...

"The staff at Comfort Suites is very accommodating, and easy to work with. I had to extend my stay, and they were happy to help me. Also, the breakfast is probably one of the best that I have had in a hotel buffet very tasty.",1
"The usual comfort and relaxation I expect from the Residence Inn/Marriott chain. Spacious accommodations, clean beds, familiar conveniences. I love the kitchenette's when available. Stay here during Valentine's Day weekend in 2016. Because of the hotel's location, I was able to navigate the surrounding area very quickly and could get in and out of traffic from the Annapolis Westfield Mall... More",1
Bad: The pull out couch was extremely uncomfortable. Good: Room was great. Staff was friendly and welcoming.,1
"Courteous and helpful staff. Very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. It was a little pricey, but comparable to most hotels in the area. The gym was very clean and all of the equipment was very well kept.",1
"Not a luxury hotel by any means, but Sedona is beautiful so you shouldn't be in the room anyway! Good value, great service, nice employees, decent breakfast. Overall happy with the stay.",1
Everything was Excellent!!! Quality Service! Will be coming Back!!!!,1
"We found Indigo through searching on Trip Advisor. We were looking for a unique, boutique type hotel with competitive rates. We loved this hotel! It was definitely competitively priced and significantly cheaper than the big flags downtown. But the value is amazing! Big, spacious rooms an enormous, wonderful shower comfortable bedding clean throughout warm and friendly staff great breakfasts (complimentary)... More",1
"Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review. You are welcome back anytime!Hilton Garden Inn Napa Management",1
"I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great.",1
"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay.

"This is a solid 3 star hotel, the rooms are old and smell like mildew. The air conditioning is loud and drips. If you get a room on the ocean they have good views and a good balcony. The staff was nice at check in. It's not great but not terrible. It's a typical Miami 3 star hotel.",1
Good: I loved the lighting and how comfortable the bed was.,1
Employee's are friendly and helpful - rooms are clean and comfortable. The resort is located in a great spot right on Lake Delton. I love sitting on their sandy beach in the morning drinking my cup of coffee.,1
It was great room was very nice n they treated me like a vip,1
"Don't know how this place has some many high reviews. The rooms were not well maintained or cleaned. The management photos are very misleading. See my attached room photos of what you really get. Sticky wet floors, sticky walls in the bathroom, thick layers of dust, blood or burn stains on the sheets, AC from the 80's that barely ran,... More",0
"The bathroom was too cramped the room just average. The menus were overpriced and unremarkable. The staff was courteous and responsive to requests. The fitness facility was adequate however, the lap pool is too short and too hot. The locker rooms were exceptional. The access to the Fashion Centre was an unexpected treat.",1
"We had a great night here! Food at Fuego was awesome!!! Great patio dinning experience! Free cruise shuttle! It was our anniversary so they sent us a bottle wine and chocolate! Amazing! We did have a minor leaky roof, they moved us to new room, that room reaked if marijuana. But it was late and I didn't want to move... More",1
"To be honest, at 52.78 (including tax) this was a good value for the money. The rooms are fairly clean (ish) and are a good size. However, there is an underlying 'funky' smell that is everywhere - from the lobby to the rooms. When I laid down for the night the smell was not sleep inspiring to say the least.... More",0
"My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend.",1
"We really loved this place. It's beautiful. The grounds look great. The rooms are spacious and very well kept. We would definitely stay again. We had a three bedroom unit, and they were all wonderful.",1
"We don't give many 5 stars, but this hotel deserves it! And, to Kevin in the front lobby, we give 6 stars! What a pleasure to be treated by Kevin and the rest of the staff, as if they really appreciated us staying at their hotel. Kevin even showed us our room before we decided which floor we wanted. The... More",1
"Not only is this a great motel, it is also a Route 66 historic icon! The staff is super friendly and service is great. This is my choice hotel when staying overnight in Springfield, MO! If you stay in Springfield then this is the place for you, your family, associates and friends!",1
"The room was clearly not vacuumed and the bathroom floor not cleaned either. Beds were clean and fresh and bathroom counter sparkling. The room's door latch did not fully function when used from the outside and we had real trouble getting into the room every time, to the point of shoulder ramming the door to get in. Luckily, half of... More",1
"This recently remodeled facility looked, smelled and felt clean and fresh - very modern. The secure parking was easily accessible and security within the hotel itself was excellent. Bed was comfortable, wi-fi was good, and staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.",1
"The hotel was very comfortable and modern. It was ideally located close to some great tourist sights of SF. Located a few blocks south of Market St, it was a lot easier to get to and from the hotel then the ones in down town or union square area. The rooms had a great view of of SF or the... More",1
"Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!",0
"It is right under space needle. You can even see Space Needle from the window. After the tour of space needle, kids actually had a nap in the hotel as it is only a few steps away. It is a new Hyatt property with free breakfast.",1
"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1

It's an old hotel. The towel service wasn't great. Almost all carbs - fattening foods for breakfast. Didn't eat it any morning.,1
Our stay at the London was wonderful. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We stayed in a lovely suite with a nice view. It was very similar to a condo. Bedroom and separate living room space. The decor was very welcoming and it was a confortable living space. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. This hotel is centrally located and... More,1

Reasonable for Santa Barbara, great service, lovely place close to State St. and everything, and the little restaurant was FABULOUS. Darned if I didn't have the best eggs benedict ever. Not kidding. Ever. With arugala. And the nicest part was it was included with... More",1
Difficult to find with few signs and not visible from the road.,1
This hotel has great dinner and breakfast package highly appreciated throughout the region. It make for a great place to hold family get togthers or just for a weekend get away. The staff is very friendly and helpful and makes repeat guests feel like they are coming home. The rooms could stand to be a little updated but the luxury suites are above and beyond.,1
Park and fly was good. Staff recommend a great place to eat. Shower head not working well. Need to update mattress.,1
La habitacion ligeramente reducida. Falto mobiliario para desempacar y empacar maletas. por lo demas excelente. muy recomendable,1
"Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options. Good: location",0
Bad: UnSweetened iced tea would be good. Good: I like the waffles,1
"A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget.",1
"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.",0
"Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip",1
"Located near multiple restaurants and shopping, the hotel was friendly and easily accessible, as expected with a Westin the rooms were well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. The seating area in the lobby was comfortable for business discussions",1

"We stayed at the Carneros Inn during a 3 day vacation with friends. This place is very special and unique.. Each room is an individual bungalow with hardwood floors, a private patio and fireplace in each room. It's very romantic, peaceful and relaxing. My only complaint about the room was the heater was incredibly loud when it would turn on... More",1
"I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed.",1
"The individual by the name of John who worked the front desk was very rude on May 17, 2016.I would never recommend or stay at this hotel. My sister ended up just leaving without staying after she paid her money. I am calling the manager as soon as possible.",0

Bad: Nown. Good: None,1
"I can't find any fault with our stay. Well, maybe the entrance is not well identified and, on two occasions, the card-key to the room failed.",1
Make sure you do not get a room with a generator and Air con units directly outside of the windows. Very noisy and low occupancy the night I checked in. The hotel should be aware of this and take action not to give to guests when occupancy is low,1
"We arrived very late but glad to find a clean, comfortable room. Pillow tops on bed were an extra gift to my husband who had been driving for 3 days. Building is a little tired, but clean. If you need stores or restaurants, there are MANY good ones nearby.",1
"The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful! Breakfast was delicious, they have this tasty citrus-water that is to die-for on the daily! My room was clean, fresh-smelling, and cozy. I couldn't have asked for a better stay, and I will definitely stay at this wonderful hotel again! FIVE STARS.",1
Our family returned to Santa Fe this last week for a summer visit. We were happy to be treated again with the same warm hospitality as our previous visits to the Pecos Trail Inn. Our room was always extremely clean. It was comfortable and cozy and the decor is perfect!,1
Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!,1
The towels were stained. The comforter had burn holes in it. The tub grips were starting to turn black. And there were bugs in the bed. My sister and I ended up sleeping on top of the covers because it was a holiday weekend and nowhere else had vacancies.,0
I have to say I am never happy when I get out of my car and walk into my room. The room was clean enough but the air conditioner was loud and if you turned it off the heat was unbearable after a few minutes. The door to the room was allowed sunlight around all sides and with opening like... More,1
"Great location the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, especially William. The rooms are clean, quiet, and the beds are super comfy. Only drawback was that the rooms need a bit of a make-over (The bathrooms look pretty out-dated). They have free (included in your room price) wine and cheese in the evening, free breakfast and at 9:00pm there... More",1
Awesome! We had a wonderful time. The hotel have a amazing breakfast every morning! Definitely will stay again.,1
The hotel was nice. Beds were very comfy! Elevators wre fast. My only negative would be the smoke in the casino was pretty bad. And there was not a no smoking area which I found odd.,1
"This hotel is situated close to the Seattle Center. The staff are really friendly and efficient. Just as well as we had a few problems. Soundproofing between floors is poor, and we had two very disturbed nights with a family above us sounding like a herd of elephants. The air con units had to be replaced in both our rooms... More",1

"I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel.

The exterior does not look super attractivebut very nice on the inside. The room was comfortable and had updated appliances. Loved that it is a pet friendly hotel that did not charge additional fees. Would highly recommend to others.,1
"This hotel is very quaint, with its large foyer with huge open fire and, indoor heated pool and large rooms. Breakfast every morning in the dinning room was traditional US. Value for money absolutely.",1
"Bad: I didn't care about some of the staff attitude they could have been a little more friendlier towards the guest at the hotel,and I think it was a little to pricey for the stay. Good: I liked how clean the hotel was and the comfort of the room. The breakfast was good as well.",1
"This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay.

Restaurant has same hours. Extensive menu,... More",1
Bad: Facilities feel outdated. Good: Breakfast was great and the Starbucks in the lobby was awesome!,1
It wasn't our first time at this motel. We like it because it is in a good centrally located spot and is reasonably priced. They have added a complimentary breakfast room since our last time there. The staff is nice. The facility for the most part is in good shape for its age. The only thing I didn't like was that the mattresses are too soft for my back. When we return to Gatlinburg again we will try to stay there again and hope for a new firmer mattress.,1
Rooms were bigger than expected and five of the rooms we booked had a lounge bench. Staff allowed the use of breakfast room for a late meeting. This is a no smoking and no pet hotel. Breakfast was basic cold continental. Great rate.,1
"My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area.",1

"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.",1
Bad: I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me or next to me all night. Got no sleep.,1
Made trip in late December. Very satisfied with overall experience. Room and service were pretty good. Easy to connect Wifi. Parking is nearby. Oceanfront room with nice views. Is nearby to attractions.,1
Good: The hotel was great I loved the room the bed was super clean and comfortable and so was the bathroom. We only stayed one night here because our other hotel was booked for the rest of the trip but I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to Vegas for my entire trip. Great location,1
"Best Western on Pacific Ave Atlantic City NJ was dirty, bad section of town, in fear of our families safety. Never again, I always stay at Best Westerns , never a problem, but stay away from this one.",0
Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated.,0

Our visit to Bricktown was wonderful. From the time we arrived at the hotel and throughout our visit everyone was extraordinarily welcoming. They really made us feel they were glad we were there. Location of the hotel is perfect to experience the excitement of the Riverwalk. This is definitely a place we will visit again.,1

The room was very clean and spacious. Wish the pillows were Fuller and fluffy.,1
Bad: The view. Good: Everything,1
"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker.",1
"it was an amazing experience. The Hotel was well furnished, it seemed like they got it remodeled recently.

"Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal.",1
So my fianc an i stayed at the hotel the night the front desk gentlemen was super nice an friendly next morning breakfast was awesome. The room was very clean an if you want to take a hot shower. Best hot shower ever. Would definitely be going there again.,1
The rooms were clean and the environment was very pleasant. The staff was extremely pleasant. They seemed to take pride in their roles and were very accommodating to their customers. They were very diligent in keeping the buffet stocked ensuring everyone was satisfied.,1
Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager,0
Good: Great stay for short stay.,1
"The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it).",1

"Nice size rooms. Breakfast and drinks and the reception a plus! The kids loved the pool. Very close to downtown, only 10 min. drive. We will be back!",1
We were very happy with everything. A Continental breakfast would have been an added value. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for grear accommodations and staff not far at all from Wisconsin Dells!,1

I love visiting the Galt House because the customer service is fantastic rooms are always super clean. The suites tower is my favorite part of the hotel. The breakfast is phenomenal (especially the pancakes ordered from room service). Definitely plan on a relaxing stay at the Galt House.,1
This hotel is less than a mile from DuPont so I decided to stay here.I am a smoker and when I found out that the hotel was smoke free I started to find another hotel to stay at.The hotel was clean and the room was rather nice but I am more apt to stay else where that has smoking.,1
Bad: The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!. Good: The staff!

"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable.",1
Dog friendly with excellent grass for walking and convenient field adjacent to the building. Friendly receptionist with props to demonstrate the shower mechanism! Good convenient Japanese restaurant in short walking distance provides a wonderful change from road food. All you need when passing through on a road trip.,1
Really enjoyed our stay at this property! The standard rooms are fairly decent sized and so are he bathrooms. The lounge area is spectacular and vey lively at night. The biggest advantage of this hotel is the location. It's close to the 3rd street promenade and the pier the beach at Santa Monica.. Will visit again!!,1

Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.",1

"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.",1
"I booked a Superior room. Upon check in I requested a room down stairs due to my inability to climb stairs. Was informed there were none. Then she said wait a minute I have the handy cap room, I asked if was a superior room and was told it was. The room was not a SUPIOR room. I paid for supior.",0

Will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.Dear RobinsU9085vk,Thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us.

Only stayed one night but that was enough to enjoy my stay. The hotel and room were very clean and looked to be recently redone within the last few years. The staff was very courteous and professional. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food to be excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is staying in the area.,1
"Beautiful casino and restaurant and shopping district. Vegas always seems to offer a 5 star experience for much less than other cities. I love this hotel and will be back many times in the future. The staff is friendly, the food is t too pricy and the location is perfect.",1

"Very nice spot to take a few days and enjoy the local color and Rocky Mountain National Park. The staff were friendly, helpful, accommodative and very nice.

"The staff at this hotel went over and beyond in service and anything that was requested was done right away. The breakfast was great, warm, and refilled quickly. Fresh baked cookies in the evening waiting for us in the lobby. The pool was kept clean and was in a centrally located convenient location. We enjoyed our stay.",1

Its always good staying in an Embassy with the evening reception and the made to order breakfast...,1
Very disappointed in my visit! There was no iron or ironing board so I went wrinkled. They false advertised free breakfast in morning because they just switched from Days inn to home stay so they didn't have license to serve food yet. I will not be back,0
"Pluses: reasonable rates, great helpful friendly staff, shuttle to trains, nearby mall, lots of dining choices minutes from hotel. Minuses : mattresses old and needing update, rooms dark more lights will help lots, a refrigerator is a must in a room. Long ride into town by train and 5-6 bucks each way. Tip: leave your car at the station for 5 bucks and fast return to hotel or mall.",1
"The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",1
"My family and I booked this hotel for 5 nights through booking.com while in town for the LA marathon. It was a great deal: close to Dodger stadium for the start, had free wifi and breakfast and the price was better than most we had been seeing in town about this time. It was quiet the rooms were very clean... More",1
"This hotel was in a great location--very convenient for a visit to Cornell. The prices were reasonable, and it was very nice to have a free breakfast and free coffee. The breakfast included eggs and homefries, as well as yogurt etc. Also, there was free coffee at all times of the day and night!",1
The staff was friendly and helpful. I love Hampton Inns. Every Hampton inn is the same. It is consistent. Unlike other chain hotels which may be franchised. You always know a Hampton will be comfortable and clean.,1
"Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT.",1
"We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door.",1

"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line.",1
I travel a lot for business and generally use Best Western. This hotel was not up to par for BW. The carpet was stained and dirty. It had a 4 hole in the threshold between bed/bath rooms.

If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton.

"This is a unique property in that they combined a Hilton Garden Inn with a Homewood Suites (Also by Hilton).

Just stayed one night for the nearby wrestling show. Hotel was undergoing a MASSIVE remodel but the room was still nice and slept very comfortably. Breakfast was very good as well. This place seems like it will be very very nice once the remodel is complete.,1
Everyone on staff was great and continued to be helpful and just excellent customer service Breakfast bat crew also great,1
"The hotel was clean and we had at our request a quiet room, room service was good.

"Service is great, Charles is awesome, he goes above and beyond to take care of us. Everyone, actually, was very friendly and very helpful. The only two things we didn't like was the room had a horrible view, and the pillows were so soft that they didn't provide any support, and that made sleep not very comfortable.",1

"My wife and I had a dual interview in Lakeland in the early morning and this was a pleasant stay in a clean room with all new amenities. Everything about the hotel was nice and clean, the area was easy to get to and the surrounding neighborhood seemed safe.",1
"There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel.",0

"Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation.",1
"Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar.",1
"We've stayed at the Hamptons in Gloucester multiple times, and I've never had a complaint. The staff is wonderful and accommodating. Wonderful beds and breakfast.",1
"Bad: I don't eat Japanese food and the were limited offerings of American food on the room service menu. Good: Clean, convenient, quiet",1
"The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.",1
Don't stay join the 2nd floor by the street. Way too noisy. Bathrooms are small and need exhaust fans/ Decorating looks like the 1980's florals came alive. Staff is great though and location is great if you don't have a car. Walking distance to town and beach. Beautiful area with nice restaurants,1
"Hourly shuttle service to the airport. Very reasonable. Room was large, clean and comfortable. Return shuttle service took a little bit of a wait.",1
"This was a nive hotel. The bed was very confortable. the rooms were very clean, and it was nice that they had a wall thermostat to better regulate the rooms temperature. the HVAC was quiet and the staff was very helpful. The box spring was a bit worn though. I had use some pillows under the mattress to stop the feling of sleeping up side down. other than that it was a great stay",1
"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments.

NICE PLACE TO STAY BUT BREAKFAST COULD IMPROVE,1
"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season! WHODAT!!Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1

It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner.",1
We stayed at this property two weekends ago for a small family get away. Hotel lobby was nice and the front desk people were pleasant and helpful when asking about local foods in the area. We spend part of the first evening at the bar and the bartenders were very pleasant and poured well for a hotel bar (not over... More,1
"Bad: Smoky lobby due to casino - it should be separate from the lobby area Restaurant is noisy and smoky. Good: Room was clean Shower was good, lots of hot water Hotel is close to the strip, makes it easy to walk there",1
I stayed here because I wanted to see the town of Onancock.,1
"I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com",1

"I'm a Hilton Gold member and was told on check in I could have a bottle of water each day during a busy two week stay. Keep in mind Kingsland water has a significant sulfur taste, so tap water is almost undrinkable. Later when I requested the water, I was told I had been promised something in error and would...

"The staff was friendly, the room was great and spacious and the included breakfast was great. A convenient option for business or vacation. I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites, but now I am thinking about using them during our upcoming summer vacation.",1
"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.",1
"Large rooms, good beds and great price. Staff was very helpful and the area was safe. It was quite considering it is along a major road. About 2 miles form downtown area so you will have to drive to get there.",1
"I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)",1
"Bad: Only 2 elevators, coffee. Good: Breakfast included as well as one drink (5-8 pm), new and well kept, great location",1
"The hotel is very new and beautiful. I had a large spacious room with king bed overlooking the hills. The bathroom was large and nicely done - loved the large walk in shower! The breakfast is delicious with lots of healthy options and the room service is good, fast and 24 hours. The rooftop pool is nice. Good size pool... More",1
"Da wir nur eine Nacht in Charleston bleiben konnten, war es uns wichtig m√∂glichst zentral im Herzen des ""Historic Charleston"" zu wohnen. Die Lage ist auch wirklich super. Auch sonst hatten wir nichts an dem Hotel auszusetzen, obwohl die Fotos vielleicht ein bisschen mehr vermuten lassen als tats√§chlich dahinter ist und auch das Wort ""Grand Hotel"" etwas hochgegriffen ist.Das Zimmer war gro√ü und sauber, dasBett bequem, das Personal freundlich und entgegenkommend, die Lage super.",1
great.,1
"Building is 4 story, approximately 4 years old. The staff is very efficient and quite friendly (Just what you expect when in Mississippi). Good breakfast. The hotel is near the I-22 corridor and quite close to Natchez Trace Parkway. Rooms for my two separate visits were clean and spacious. Definitely a choice in the future.",1
This is the best hotel to stay when you are visiting Laughlin. Their room are nice newly remodeled their pool is nice for the little ones. Also it's got a great view of the river and the stage whenever festivities are going on. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Colorado belle,1
Union organizers with megaphone reading union laws at 7 am! Due to the layout of the hotel it is amplified tenfold. Apparently there are no noise violations for doing this. Won't be back to Santa Monica better places to go that have better ordinances. Police just drive by like there is nothing going on.,0
"This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again.",1
We picked this hotel because it was halfway between Tampa and Miami. The front desk staff is so nice and helpful. They answered every question and even came and cleaned our room when housekeeping missed us. The cookies after 6 p.m. in the lobby are essential. Great stay,1
Very good hotel to stay,1
"They charged 10.00 for Continental Breakfast even for minors, my grand daughter is 6 years old, how much can she eat, and you do not have any other choices for children, and if you want from a menu is over 14.00 per item.",1
"This was by far, the nicest property we have stayed at within the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area. The scenery is beautiful with the river flowing all around the entire property. The atmosphere and ambiance is excellent. It is definitely within walking distance of all trollies just around the corner. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEST WESTERN AND WE WILL STAY HERE EVERY... More",1
"Conveniently located near FLL airport, free airport transportation, shuttle provided. Free Breakfast and WiFi. Great Service. Definitely will use this service again and recommend to my friends and family. Also, close to food outlets.",1
"Bad: Only 1 street parking spot to get registerd. Valet parking was not convenient. Did not even know where my car was at and not being able to retrieve my beach chairs, etc. Extra charge was put on account after departure but management removed it. Good: The view",1
"Friendly helpful staff with the exception of breakfast staff. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. Dissapointed the hot tub was broken and the pool was freezing cold. Not a bad stay,but not up to a Hilton property standard.",1
"Went to the Outback Bowl and watched the Vols pound Northwestern and stayed 2 nights here . Nice 2 BR with 1 a loft 3 tvs, 2 baths. Only problem was I left a plate of ribs on the table overnight and the next morning they were covered with tons of real tiny ants. Still, it was an enjoyable stay.... More",1
"The staff there were really good and the rooms comfortable. Hotel looks tired and its location good It was not too far from all things considered the likes of San Francisco, Napa Valley just to name a few",0
"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating.",0
My second stay was almost as pleasant as my first. The room and amenities werE comfortable and well appointed.,1
"The ac unit was broke in the room so we were forced to open the back door and listen to the highway noise all night. Bed sheets were stained and room maintenance needed done witb broken outlets, lamp shades, etc.",0
I stayed here for an evening during a recruiting trip to the area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything I needed. They allowed me an early check-in and the rooms were clean and modern. I really liked the lobby and its couches and chairs gave a homey and comfortable vibe to the hotel.,1
"We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More",0
"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.",1
Bad: nothing. Good: very friendly staff and help,1
"With the exception of the shower, this is a reasonably nice hotel in a nice part of town. However, the water saver on the shower was to an extreme... it was barely more than a trickle. Showering took much longer. Even just thoroughly wetting my hair took a while. In the end, it took what seemed at least twice as... More",0
"The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full.",1
"My sister I were worried about reviews of kids everywhere pool conditions and smells of a sewerage treatment facility nearby. We were NEVER effected by any of these-found wonderful large 2 BR 2 BA ocean view condo with great concierge, Jesse and free valet car attendants, Ian Leo Don. Would absolutely stay there again!",1
room was very nice and cleaned. breakfast was a nice extra. very satisfied will book again.,1
Hubby and I stopped for lunch on a Saturday. Clean with friendly servers. Very cool bar and atmosphere. People in and out while we were there getting food to go.

Spent 9 days at Embassy Suites while visiting family and sight-seeing. Short walk to Metro and access to all areas of DC made sight-seeing easy. Appreciated the full breakfast every morning and evening happy hour at end of day. Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet small kitchenette was useful. Hotel shuttle to area restaurants also appreciated.,1
"Fabulous fun at a great hotel in the middle of the French Quarter! Friendly, helpful staff, lovely clean, comfortable room. Right in the middle of all the action, it was our base for a group visit to the Nola jazz festival. Great to know that after a very full day you could come back to such a lovely home. I... More",1
"No Tissue box in the room or washroom. Room quality was poor. Cracks in the wall in washroom. Internet was pathetically slow, almost unusable, even late at night, very early in the morning. Would not stay here again.",0
Muy buen hotel,1
"Although clean, this hotel is in great need of renovation. Breakfast is the usual selections. Front desk was most helpful when we inquired about a local church and their times of services. Tha hotel was very close to several restaurants within walking distance, and the Interstate and, most importantly, the Ice Arena.",1
"Bad: Rooftop bar is more style than substance, go to be seen, not to enjoy view or surroundings, and inconvenient to have to go downstairs to go back up. Perhaps a residents hour for hotel guests only, when lift can go directly up. Good: Great location, very stylish, helpful staff especially the doormen",1
"We had a great time!! Hotel staff was pleasant and helpful, but not intrusive! Rooms were great. Bed is out of this world comfortable. I will definitely be going back!",1
"This is a clean hotel. The rooms are well kept and tidy. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The free breakfast has many options such as waffles, eggs, sausage etc. The hotel is centrally located near area restaurants and the local shopping mall. A great place to stay in the Elmira Horseheads area.",1
IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED! YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY. In addition to the 35 Resort Fee. And to top it off my room isn't ready. Staying here is like having a pretty girl with an ugly attitude. It only looks good on the outside. The management is terrible,0
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again.",1
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Kauai for two weeks in March 2016. The good: The architecture of the hotel is beautiful. The grounds are stunning. Best resort pool I've ever seen. The spa was very nice, yoga was top notch, staff was very attentive. Elevators were speedy. Tidepools restaurant was exceptionally good. The not so good: The food, with... More",1
"Bad: Advertised amenities came up majorly short. Mini bar is locked and does not have any alcohol. Shower appears to have steaming functionality, but didnt work. Breakfast was bread, cereal and hard boiled eggs. Considering you pay 20+ in resort fees, you'd think they'd put a little more effort into the little things. Good: Room was gorgeous, bed was comfortable, shower was nice, starbucks coffee machine is nice.",1
"In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!",1
"Stopped in St. Ignace to stay the night on our way up north. All they had left was a Jacuzzi room, and it was quite nice. It was heart shaped and they way it was set up, we could each sit comfortably next to each other and watch television. The bed was not the most comfortable but I was not... More",1
"Didn't clean our room one day for no reason, left early and came back late.",1
"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review.",1
Stayed here for a volleyball tournament close by. Room was what you expect for this price point. Had a decent breakfast. Easy to get to from interstate.,1

The part that really impressed me was the room it was very stylish almost as nice as a... More",1
"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!",1
"The location was fine since everything on the island is a short trip away. But the room smelled of spray disinfectant and was extremely small it didn't even have a closet although it had everything else it was jammed in there. Actually everything was jammed in, they did not have a separate area for the breakfast it was set up in the lobby which is small as well and which you had to walk back and forth to four separate sections to get to as people are checking in and out and leaving for the day. Even the hallways were small and you had to squeeze around the cleaning carts or move them. I will say they use every space available they can. The pool was nice and the staff as well although it seemed disorganized. I didn't hate my stay but i felt i was overcharged.",1
"I had to stay for one night in Milledgeville for business. My company participates in a Corporate Lodging program so my options in an area are predetermined and limited. This hotel was ranked best of what was available without driving to Macon. I consider the hotel and room serviceable. The room, sheets and towels were clean. The air worked, the... More",1

"I booked this room by Hotwire.com and thought I was going to have a TERRIBLE experence because of how much I paid. HOW WRONG I WAS! The check-in process was seemless, the lobby was extremely clean, and the employees were all plesent and helpful. The rooms are large and clean. To top it all off they provide a continental breakfast!... More",1
We stop here often if we cannot get a decent price in a WDW resort. We stayed here on our way back from the Masters golf tournament. After driving 8 hours from Augusta we tried to check in at 2:30PM but were told check in was 4PM and they had NOTHING available at that time. Desk clerk said she would... More,0
"I am on a business trip. The service is like dial up. I already changed rooms to get a signal. I am using my Iphone to connect. Talked to someone from their ISP named Kevin. Completely worthless. Never called me back and didn't fix a thing,",0
"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.",1
Good: Great location and nice facilities. Large clean rooms and the staff were very helpful. Would have no problem staying here again.,1
Great service and food. No complaints they were very hospitable. When I travel I try to stay at the Hampton inn if there's one near by. Price is afordable and you can't beat the breakfast in the morning. There is a huge variety of food and on Sunday's they serve an even greater variety.,1
Was a good time. Housekeeping missed us one day but we're quick to come when we called about it.would stay again,1
"Stayed here a couple of weeks ago on a trip south. Needed to get past D.C. This is very good. Just inside VA and easy on and off. Courteous staff, clean.. A real good Hampton. Good restaurants near by. I'm stopping there again next week.",1

"We hosted corporate meetings here for 15-20 people for about a week and in short, i will never go back again. The rooms were fine, but the meetings were not the best and the food at the restaurant was very slow and closed early. We had working lunch catered and some of the sandwiches were moldy and service terrible when... More",0
"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites.",1
"I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment. Their attention to details and their natural sympathy made them become a reference in the island.We hope he will have the chance to fully meet your expectations during your next venue at the Saint.",1
"Room was smelly but everything else was nice, especially the hot breakfast.",1
Stayed for conference at the JW Marriott. It was a great location and easily within walking distance to my conference. It might have been closer than some of the rooms located within JW. This hotel served breakfast and had a better price on parking. Overall a great stay and I would recommend and stay again.,1
The resort was one of the most gorgeous places I have ever stayed at. Everything about the place was top-notch. The room was beautiful and equipped with everything you would need in the full kitchen and bath. The room opened up to a large balcony where we could eat our meals. We were given a gift basket with laundry detergent... More,1
"Bad: No pool. Good: Great room, fantastic spa",1
"The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work.",1
"The breakfast had a little to be desired. And we weren't told when it ended, so when we showed up there was very little, if anything left. But the staff and facilities were very nice and clean. I would probably stay there again",1

Good: Nice and comfortable hotel at the wateside with many dining options around. Room was spacious and comfortable. Staff very helpful and breakfast was good,1
The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges.,0

"Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches.",0

"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good.",1
The walls are very thin and the pipes are very noisy,1
"I have stayed at a lot of hotels through the years while vacationing at Disneyland, this hotel and its employees were wonderful. Great food service by Manuel and Vira they were the tops. I would recommend this hotel to all...",1
"I havw stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is pleasant and the rooms are clean. However, every time I stay there is usually a proble with the air conditioner or the heater. Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!",1
Bad: No hot water in the morning. Good: This was a great hotel on the strip. The only downside was bo hot water in the morning. But they acknowledged they had an issue. Would be nice if they could offer a partial refund for this.,1
"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office",1
"Nice place all around with great amenities, good breakfast, nice staff. For some reason though, at night the hotel smelled like sewage. Really. Also, my credit card pending charge is 90 more than my checkout receipt.",1
No matter the occasion this is the place to stay. The restaurant is great as is the spa. The pools and hot tubs are clean and great views of the lake!! There was a wedding going on last time we were there. Tall about a perfect location for a wedding,1
Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.,1
The place is a complete dump! The rooms are super small and cramped. They don't care about their customers and house keeping could do a way better job on the cleanliness of the rooms. There's not enough parking and the chance of your vehicle getting hit by another is highly possible. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying... More,0
"I came out to the club recently with some good friends of mine. The resort is beautiful! I loved all the amenities. And everyone was so nice! I was helped by Alex, Hunter and Leo. They were very kind and helpful. We will most definitely be coming back! :)",1
"Nice hotel and a weird location, really not near anything. They d ok have a bar and small restaurant. Comfortable hotel, was clean and nice staff. I would stay here again. Good value for the area. It was also very quiet here.",1
"Our single bed unit was updated and nice quality. Good TV, sofa, chair with ottoman. Two bar stools at a nice granite counter top. First day we received a phone call from maintenance that our tub has a leak and we would need to change units. Not happy but what can you do Doug went out of his way to... More",1
Great room. Great service. Excellent cleanliness. I'd recommend this facility to all of my friends and relatives. Great entertainment is near by. Wild Country night club. Felt safe coming and going.,1
"Short trip, hotel tired, staff indifferent",1
"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!",1
"Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",0
Comfortable room and great location. A little noisy though due to lobby noise,1
Bad: Breakfast.,1
"Had a room on the harbor side and was treated to a manatee siting our first evening there. Comfortable, clean room with washer/dryer--great for tennis players. Excellent time at the tennis center--games set up for us by Zoe every day we were there. Rode bikes one afternoon, one afternoon at the spa--perfect!",1
"Great spot to stay for 2-day conference. Clean, comfortable, convenient.",1
It the worse motel in Baton Rouge LA.it has bedbugs don't rent from them the rooms are nasty rotten mattresses in them the owner gets rude when you tell her about it the health board should be notified cause there is black mold in rm 5 along with bedbugs,0
The continental breakfast had a waffle maker - always a nice addition.,1
"Was looking for a place to sleep that was clean and easy to get on and off Interstate 90, that didn't cost and arm and a leg. The reviews on this motel were good so I went with it. I wasn't disappointed. I called about three hours away and the gentleman that answered was very polite. He reserved a room... More",1
"Great stay! Comfortable beds, staff were friendly and helpful. The pool and hot tub were nice too.",1
This boutique hotel has excellent customer service and a personal one on one experience for all the visitors. All of the staff will gladly accommodate all of your special requests including extra pillows and more ice! The daily happy hour is worth checking out to meet all the other guests and offers many opportunities to make new friends and share... More,1
"My daughter and I came to San Diego for a concert. I booked my stay but when I arrived to check-in, the hotel did not have a record of my reservation. I had my confirmation email in hand but the hotel clerk would only tell me she didn't have anything and said I needed to contact the Hotels.com. I think that I would have rated this hotel higher if perhaps she had offered to call them for my seeing as how I had my confirmation email in my hand and it would have just been that extra customer service effort. I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated. My room had a slight odor in it but after a day or so I didn't notice it. Overall my room was clean and it was quiet. It suited my needs but wasn't anything extraordinary or spectacular.",1
"After stopping over for one night in another city on the way to Springfield and being very disappointed in that hotel (Super 8), I was tempted to cancel my reservations here, but when we checked in, we were all pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the rooms - very clean, helpful and polite staff, good hot/cold breakfast, etc. I had reserved two rooms (myself husband and in-laws). We checked in Tues and out on Sat - no problems at all. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",1
"I stayed for one night after a business event. Japan House was conveniently located near both the downtown and the Interstate, and was a good value. I decided to stay based on TripAdvisor Reviews. My room (101) was unusually spacious. It was a Handicapped Access room I can't say if others are equally roomy I found it to be immaculately... More",1
"The Benson is beautiful, with a classic grand lobby with elegant seating, high ceilings, a delightful place to pause. The dining room portion of the lobby is a very well appointed space, with elegant banquette seating. It serves fine breakfast, and a menu that works well through lunch and dinner, at very reasonable prices. The happy hour is a bargain.... More",1
"I stayed at this hotel in February as part of a business trip. Overall, I found this hotel to be quite good for a Hilton Garden Inn. It's a large-sized hotel, and recently built so the rooms and common areas are in great shape. The hotel staff is very friendly, and while breakfast is an additional cost, I found the... More",1
"Meet my needs for a hotel near the airport. Hotel shuttle to airport convenient, included breakfast available at 5:30 am, room was comfortable and clean. Only problem was the phone did not work and they had no staff to deal with that problem when I arrived at 1 am. The staff did agree to knock on my door in lieu of a wake-up call - which allowed me to make my early morning flight.",1
"Trip to Barnes Hospital required a few day stay at Hampton. Impressed with staff and quality of service/product delivered. Everyone was helpful from the front desk, room service and all staff. Nice place next door to eat also. Thank you, well done!",1
Hotelli vastasi hyvin tarpeitamme. Huone oli siisti. Ilmainen kyyti metroasemalle ja kauppakeskukseen oli iso plussa. Aamupala oli keskitasoa.,1
Beautiful hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. The view was amazing because hotel is on the river.,1
Great value. The beds were very comfortable. Convenient to nearby shops.,1
It was a nice hotel with a good water park for the kids. The continental breakfast was good and they had a good selection of food. The bunk beds for the kids were cheap though and a little wobbly. TV's are old tube televisions which I haven't seen in years.,1
"Bad: How crowded the lobby seemed, mostly with locals having a stance putting out a I'll kick your ass before I move aura. Good: The overall atmosphere was clean and modern, easy to navigate to facilities I needed over stay.",1
"I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!",0
"Simple hotel, good stay. Easy access to gas station, food and dessert places. Rooms are nice, no huge complaints, had a small issue with hot water/shower but the hotel addressed and solved the issue quickly.",1
"Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified.",1
The rooms need some updating. The bathroom was very small and the exhaust fan was very loud in the bathroom.,1
"Nice hotel with beautiful views. Business trip so unfortunately only stayed one night, but will definitely return.",1
"The staff (front desk, restaurant and maintenance) are all friendly, warm and very helpful. The restaurant is average for dinner, but serves the best breakfast I've had in a hotel (ordered from the menu). The pancakes still haunt my dreams! The room had a number of maintenance issues, which were promptly addressed by the hotel as much as possible. I... More",1
"We stayed this hotel because it is close to LAX airport. However, most of our activities this time is not near the hotel. The check in staffs were friendly. We used Marriott app to confirm the hotel. The room keys were ready by 2PM as we specified. The room size is kind of small compared to other Springhill suite. And... More",1
Our son works in the area and decided to stay near his work rather then where he lives. EVERYONE at this Best Western was VERY pleasant. Every employee would always welcome us with either a hello or good afternoon. GREAT Stay and the Cinnamon rolls were awesome.,1
"So glad i got the splash and stay package. Had a great time at magic waters.One lady on 3rd shift was AWESOME. The lady that checked us in seemed like she didn't know much about the hotel or anything in the area. Rooms where OK, bed and pillows sucked. something could be done to the room to make it feel... More",1
Great accomodations for business or pleasure. Only 8-9 miles from downtown Balt. and Inner Harbor. Breakfast buffet was first class. Happy Hour from 5:30PM till 7PM was a bonus suprise. Highly recommend this location,1
We enjoyed meeting classmates of the early fifties. We have been meeting here at the Colorado Belle for the past five years. We plan on seeing each other next October if God willing. The Loading Dock is where we eat most of the time.,1
We arrived an hour early and they were able to check us in early which was very helpful. The room was nice as were the amenities. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. We left early and were offered a take away breakfast.,1
They are very accommodating and friendly!!-The only downside is there is no free parking at the hotel but besides that...it was great,1
Brand new hotel and GREAT STAFF! We got the GIANT 2 queen suite...the room was ENORMOUS! Quiet and a wonderful breakfast included! Great location and greeted with wonderful courtesy. Any question or concern was immediately taken care of!,1
"What a wonderful stay. It was our parent's 50 Year Anniversary and the hotel was amazing. The staff (especially Chris at the front desk) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived. Also, the champagne that was waiting with the flowers (charge of 28 but the champagne was great). All of the front desk staff, throughout the weekend, was so accommodating. We will definitely be back.",1
"Bad: The breakfast buffet quality was ok. The eggs were not good at all, nor the sausage. The servers were great though and that made it pleasant. Good: The staff were all incredibly kind, the beds were so soft and loved the sauna!",1
"We stayed here 3 nights in March while on a week long trip of Hawaii. It was wonderful in every way. When you enter the lobby, the backdrop is an open air view of the Ocean. It is magnificent. Breakfast is delicious and the service beyond terrific. We sat over looking the Ocean and saw whales on two mornings. Nothing... More",1
"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!",1
"Everything about this hotel was wonderful. The room was spacious and well-appointed, the staff was friendly and the food was great. We enjoyed our dinner so much the first night we had dinner again at the hotel the second night. Will definitely stay here again.",1
"Location on the Pismo beach, with a direct access, views from rooms (beach), quiet with a big parking and free wifi, BBQ and firepits available on the terrace. An exterorior pool (hot) with beach views open until 8:30 pm and two hot tubes open until 11:00 pm Friendly and professionnal staff Breakfast is good but not exceptionnal",1
Location is great for all budget shoppers and easy access to interstates highway. Breakfast was awesome!!,1
"We were disappointed in the room - however, I will say that if you're looking for a small place with a great view and a really nice park directly across the street, this place is perfect. Also, the rooftop bar was great - although a bit pricey. Our disappointment was in the room itself, which was extremely small and not at all comfortable - overall felt like it was way too much money for such an uncomfortable room.",1
"We traveled through Mesquite with 6 people, 2 adults and 4 children. We booked a room with 2 queens and a sofa sleeper and the room was huge! It had a nice fridge/microwave area and a spacious bathroom. The decor is a little dated but I felt it was clean and I was super happy with the space it provided.... More",1
Outstanding location. Hotel is beautiful and well-kept. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great food. The pool and pool bar are rooftop and offer a panoramic view of the city and river. Very relaxing. Also very relaxing is having a drink and enjoying the pianist in the afternoon. I enjoy the breakfast brunch.,1
"Bad: Couldn't accept my prepaid credit card so had to pay cash, walking round with large sums of cash, even just across the road, didn't make me feel particularly safe. Good: Great restaurant downstairs, room clean and modern, shower was like standing under a waterfall.",1
"The Hampton Inn on S. Lumpkin Rd., in Columbus, Georgia is a beautiful hotel. It is very close to the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center. The rooms were very nice, very clean. The breakfast is your typical free breakfast at most hotels, but the staff were friendly and the breakfast room inviting and clean. The only thing I found... More",1
very nice staff. clean comfortable room. excellent cook to order breakfast 10 buck extra but worth it. They also offer cooked to order diners.,1
"You get what you pay for...while the rate was good (I stayed from Sunday July 10th to Sunday July 17th for 502), some of the people greeted you and some didn't greet you. The outlets in the room barely worked. The mirror behind the bed is a little weird unless your into that type of thing. The continental breakfast was extremely bare, so I ended up eating out, unless you like only bread and waffles then your golden..the pool is extremely small..the location is great because you can walk the strip and everything is around that area but you have to deal with the traffic. All in all for the price it was ok, I am not going to be praising the hotel's name anytime soon..I have stayed in Motel 6 and Red Roof Inn with better service than this hotel...save up for a better hotel",1
"IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location.",1
"I arrived in town with several motel choices. I called the owner and he was wonderful, He gave a great price for a fantastic room. I loved the town as well. Lots to see and do including fossil hunting. Great people too. A wonderful visit!",1
Staff was friendly and informative... However... Room was a little dirty. Curtains were severly stained and carpet was filthy. Walked around with socks and within a few steps to the bathroom socks were black. Smelled humid and hallway was dirty.,0
"We really enjoyed our overnight visit at the Hilton Garden. The staff was very attentive and my daughter and I felt like we were home. My only disappointment was that we had to pay for breakfast. It wasn't that great, and I felt that it should have been included.",1
"For the location, right outside of Savannah, the price can't be beat. The staff is very polite and accommodating, the motel is always busy with travelers, so you can assume it's a decent place to stay. The breakfast the following morning is better than most, they actually have pretty decent food. I enjoy staying here, and will come back",1
"Nestled in Cooks forest, it's a clean, charming and Rustic Lodge. BEAUTIFUL natural wood. The restaurant is amazing! The quality of the food ( breakfast and lunch) prepared to perfection. I love the quietness and the lovely 4pm warm tea and fresh out of the oven cookies and muffins. It was a nice added touch! The only thing I would... More",1
Hotel had a bad smell,1
"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!",1
"I stayed here the weekend of September 25th and had a relaxing stay. The location is a little odd but otherwise I have no complaints. It's close to the mall and numerous restaurants, overall a reasonable stay.",1
We are having work done in our home and needed somewhere comfortable to stay that wasn't too far for my husband to commute to work and so I could get my daughter to school on time. Glad we chose the Raddison. It was comfortable and convenient.,1
"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!",1
"We were there for a girls night out, it was nice and in a great location, the rooms were nice, carpets was stain free but needed to be cleaned had a slight odor",1
"This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex. When I called the operator to find out the opening time of Jean Phillipe, she said, they opened 30 minutes ago, Mr. G---, they are waiting for you...--absolute magic.",1
"The room was incredible. King bed and sleeper sofa, fill sized desk with real office chair, kitchen type area with mini sink. Ceilings must have been at least 16' high. Gave the room a nice grandiose feel. Only disappointment was at breakfast when we were told they had run out of waffle batter the day before. There were other options, but not the same.",1
"I traveled to Pittsburgh for two football games during Halloween Weekend: the Wagner College-Duquesne University game on October 31st and the Steelers-Bengals game on November 1st and, needing a hotel room for the evening of October 31st, chose Marriott Pittsburgh City Center.

"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",1
Bad: 100 incidental charge to your debit card that doesn't go back on your card for 7-10 business days.,1
Hotel was excellent. Staying a second night and getting the room over forty dollars cheaper without booking through hotels dot com was even better. Lesson learned.,1
"Staff was very nice, room was not ready but they resolved the issue promptly, love the kitchen and fireplace.",1
I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.,0
"Bad: No one knew where the sauna was located. Good: Bed was amazing, bathroom was amazing, great view",1
Excellent hospitality from check in to check out. Great value. Price includes drinks and light supper which was very child friendly and hot/cold breakfast that will bring us back,1
"This was the first time we stayed at this motel. We usually stay at chain hotels with a free breakfast, but none was available. so we decided to give this a try.

"I stayed here for one night for business. I am a Marriott person myself, but was pleasantly surprised! I would compare it to a Marriott Courtyard!

I would highly recommend it!",1

"The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were in town for a cheer competition and so were a lot of other girls...lots of doors opening and closing, To be expected.",1
"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service.",1

We had originally planned to stay at a much more expensive hotel as I had never stayed at a BW before. This trip was the first my husband and I had taken without our children in 8 years so I wanted it to be nice. But I just couldn't stomach paying the amount of money that other hotel was asking...

"Pros: This hotel seems fairly new and is pretty clean with no weird smells. Our room was insanely spacious, the shower head was very relaxing, and the bed was very comfortable. There was a good variety of breakfast items available and they were pretty tasty for the most part. All the furniture and decor look tasteful and are in good... More",1
"Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed.",1
"Place is old, smoky, and run down. The location is awkward to get to.",0
"Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off. Good: The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom. WiFi was good.",1
I stayed here for one night while passing through Virginia. I had a comfortable second-floor room in which I slept well. Despite being close to the highway the place was quiet. In the morning a basic breakfast was available. On arrival I found that the ac in my room did not work but it was quickly fixed. I was not... More,1
"This was the first hotel we have ever stayed at that felt like you were sleeping inside of a walk-in closet the room had no window at all and was very claustrophobic we stayed in room 1701 and apparently from speaking to the front desk over 1/3 of the hotels rooms or exactly like this king room I feel that the hotel should forewarn you of these fax however they do not the staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was just not up to par like other Aloft hotels we have stayed at We do have 21 King rooms in the hotel that do not have a window and while they will run you the same price as our traditional kings, there is an option to choose this room. Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room. We are thrilled to hear the staff was accommodating and we will be sure the front desk is confirming room types at check in.Thanks for your business, we hope you'll be back,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
"We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC.",1
"This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff.",0
"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!",1
"We stayed at the Shore hotel two months ago, the hotel exceeded our expectations. We stayed in an Ocean-view Premier room which offered us a view of the pool and ocean.

"Having stayed at several Embassy Suites, this one in Crystal City does not meet the expectation of Embassy Suite standards. The hotel's only restaurant does not have much to offer as compared to the 3 restaurants of Marriott Hotel which is next door. The front desk people needs further training in Customer Service. Granted that they may be college students, their customer service needs to focus on the needs of the Customer such as inquiring if there are any questions we may have regarding the town i.e, restaurants, shopping, metro transit. The only thing that is great w/ this place is their full breakfast.",1
"This hotel was nice and clean.Walking distance to several restaurants,it was an easy drive to get there.",1
"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.",1
We stayed there for one night on FSU Graduation weekend. Reservations were made far in advance and we requested a second or higher floor room.

"The hotel was in a convenient location and had a friendly staff. Breakfast and snack selection were good as well as fresh. Check in/check out quick. spacious lobby, comfortable beds and pillows. The hotel was quiet and easy to find off the highway.",1
"When I open the room I was amazed how great it was. The bed, the pillows, the sheets, the towels, the bath. I had no idea for the price what a great place I would get",1
"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

Always great staying here. But i have noticed staff less unfriendly and more rude.,1
"the hotel was beautiful! the staff friendly but the room was missing a few amenities such as no cream or sugar for coffee. Bell man left me in the hotel lobby with a full cart, 2 kids and a small dog in crate, after i had tipped him to take me upstairs. I had to manage by myself. Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet.",0
First off they way over charged me. Beds were terrible had cigarette burns in the comforter. Entry ways to rooms smelt terrible. Stains and trash on the floor. Safe was not functional. Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional. Trash on room patios. There was a Bullet hole in a window.,0

"Clean, shopping near by, very pleasant staff, would stay here again",1
"Close to all the beautiful beaches. Resort appears outdated from the outside but pretty nice inside the rooms. Tiki bar is the gem of the resort, what a fun time. Would come back for sure. Bath tub was a little gross, shower head was shady but sht happens!",1
"When I opened the door to my room the trash can was on the floor with garbage from it on the floor. There were big cigar or cigarette ashes on one bed and an aluminum beer can on the entertainment center. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. I called down to the front desk and she apologized emphatically and I went down to get another room key. Mind you I was with my family of 4, 2 small kids in tow. The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain. We stayed a total of 6 nights, but only because I had already prepaid. If I had not, we would have moved to another hotel.",1
"Don't misunderstand - we would fully recommend the hotel itself. The restaurant Pizzazz Tuscan Grille is another story. Food was OK, portions were small for the and service was bad. There are much better choices nearby.",1

Needed to stay here due to a family funeral and it was fine. Didn't pay much attention to decor or things like that but it was clean and the staff for the most part were very nice. We stayed a week and had no complaints and considering why we needed to stay there we were grateful.,1
me and my girlfriend was just looking for a random hotel to stay in since she live in north carolina i stay in virginia came across this for a gud price booked it enjoyed our little weekend together loved the kitchen and the water n the shower wasnt cold had no problem that wasnt fixable it was a nice comfortable stay,1
"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,",1
"This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada.",0

"Bad: I had made my reservations 3 months ago for a 1 night stay for my friends aND I. We have been making this trip for 40+ years, and are certainly used to paying premium hotel rates for very average hotel rooms due to the season and oceanfront property. However this hotel room was very disappointing. We were given a handicap access room.Keep in mind, we are able bodied, active middle-aged ladies who rin marathons. This room had a bathroom that provided a shower stall for a wheelchair access, thus no way to prevent water from the shower head to go all over the bathroom. What a mess! We basically had to sop up water from the floor after each of us showered. The rooms only provide double beds, so even for the smaller ladies, was a cramped sleeping experience. Upon registering and first entering the room, I asked if we could have another room option.The front desk declined indicating that other rooms were not available.So, we paid over 350 a night for a below standard room. They should have at least offered us a discount. We will seek other accommodations for our annual trip next year!. Good: Location is great. Easy access to the boardwalk and beach.Decent hot and cold complimentary breakfast.",1

Bad: Invoicing of non used items after leaving the hotel.,1

"There are not many places to stay in this area, so this place is a good place for the night. It certainly beats the lower-priced hotels/motels that are usually offered in remote areas.

"Overall I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times. I had to ask to be moved after my first night - my original room smelled very musty - I thought it was cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking hotel. They promptly moved me the following day to a much nicer room on the 10th floor. I must say though, I thought it was a bit inappropriate that, on the morning when I was moved, one male member of staff (at least I thought) was very condescending to another staff member in front of me - insisting several times that she call housekeeping to clean my previous room straight away (he could've waited until I wasn't standing there) as she had her hands full trying to move me to a different room. Aside from that though - all of the other members of staff were first class. The furniture was a bit dated as well, however for a budget(ish) hotel, it was more than adequate. Good water pressure too in the shower.",1
"This was a very pleasant resort. We were only able to stay one night, but would have loved to stay longer. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Excellent choice, and pet friendly!",1
"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",0

My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great.",1

"Entire Staff were excellent, with special mention for Taunya and Kayla at the front desk. They were always cheerful,smiling, and very helpful. Great breakfast, only issue is that space is limited so you may have to wait to sit if you want to eat there. Our room was worn and dated....Hotel needs updating but from the looks of it they may be in the process of doing. Large outdoor pool was clean and well kept. Kids loved it :-) Many restaurants and a very nice shopping mall minutes away. Overall.... great value for the price.",1
"Had a great stay, quiet restful. Grandkids had fun playing games in the game room, then they went swimming, so it was fun for everyone. Will definitely stay here again.",1
"Stayed here for a WCU graduation. Rates were high, room was so so. Breakfast was bland and sparse. Bathroom was dirty, doors were beaten up and everything was tired and outdated. Not a definite no, but for the price I was very disappointed. Better places to stay for far less money.",1
"I really like the hotel, the location was nice. Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations.",1
"I would stay here again. The ease of highway access to downtown and local nearby places to catch a quick bite or drink. Darcy's, just a walk around the corner is a good place to catch lunch or dinner. The Pub has that bistro type environment with open air settings.

"We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks. In addition, we were going to have our son just sleep on the floor, but my husband saw bugs all over the side wall... For the upcharged price, this is a no go in future. Will sleep in car next time and save 200",1

"After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip.",1
Stayed 2 nights Aug. 22 23 2015 in the co-ed dorm. Quiet atmosphere. Both the staff and guests were friendly. About a 8 or 9 minute walk down the hill and over the dunes to the huge beach. The building is an old Coast Guard station owned by National Park System (leased by HIHostel from what I was told)... More,1
"I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.",1

"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available.

Excellent place to stay for Hoopfest. It's a short walk to the downtown area. Friendly staff with excellent customer service. Free water and Gatorade for Hoopfest was a plus. Television reception was a little fuzzy at times. Clean and comfortable room.,1
"great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return.",1

The front desk staff was kind and courteous. The room was clean. Our only problem was the sound proofing was awful. We could here conversations from other guests in the hall or next door. Heard every step the people above us took and they took PLENTY!!!!,1
We came to Redding to handle a family tragedy when my wife passed away.

But, the real gem is the lobby/Bistro! Excellent staff, trendy, great food! There is a bar, fireplace living room area, seating options and so welcoming and comfortable! I again will stay... More",1
"The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.",0
The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night.,1

Great place to hang and rest after doing the Key West thing. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is gorgeous! Attention to detail from the lobby to the room's bathroom.

I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again.",1

"The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers.",1
Hotel and Service was Fantastic!,1
"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.",1

"Bad: Initially had a two double bedded room (later switched) and the beds in this room were too small and woefully uncomfortable. Mattresses were sub standard. However, were swiftly moved to much more comfortable king bedded room. Good: ber cool. Tech savvy property with atmospheric bar area and games room. Very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly front front desk staff. King rooms are spacious and comfortable Location could not be better.",1
Thought from reviewing this hotel that it was a winner! We got there and the room was awful!! it was in need of a facelift! And the square footage was smaller than advertised. A real downer and the front desk team was not helpful at all.,0
"As a very frequent traveler and IHG member, often my internal hotel expectations are set higher than they should be. A common life error. This property exceeds every travelers expectations with Super friendly people and efficient service from the moment you approach the service desk. I was happily greeted with a smile by Jessa, who took personal ownership of my... More",1
Hidden away from heavy traffic,1
Found this nice spot by chance. Was impressed by how clean it was and the reno's continue. The owner is a super guy. Located right beside the highway so didn't need to go looking for it. Park right outside your door.,1
"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.",0
"Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging.",1
"First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!",0
"Rail Haven is a superb example of the perfect Route 66 place to stay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are clean and decorated in Art Deco design which takes you back in time. Even though on main road, you could not hear the traffic in your room. A very comfortable stay. The continental breakfast in The... More",1
Hotel keys are required to lift the gate to the parking area which was a nice feature. Very close to Cumberland Mall and tons of restaurants and shops. The young man working the front desk when we checked out at was extremely friendly and helpful. Most hotel employees don't seem sincere but he did. My only complaint is that we... More,1
"This is a good value in a suite-type hotel. Good location near Rosslyn, friendly staff and spacious rooms.",1
"We stayed overnight. We made a reservation and paid for a king room ONLINE. Check-in went easily enough, we entered our room and found it had 2 queen beds. No big deal, right We immediately called the front desk and was informed they had no king rooms available. When asked why as we reserved and paid for a king room,... More",1
"This is a beautiful hotel room. The high ceilings and dated architecture were appreciated. The suite I stayed in had all of the amenities that I would have needed (had I actually cooked there). Very nice staff. I forgot my toothpaste and within minutes housekeeping brought me a new tube. Other places I've had to go to the front desk, or they would take hours. The work out room was a little dated, but they did have a total body machine that was good to use.",1
I am always pleased with my time at a Hampton Inn. I stay for business but would recommend the Hampton Inns for anyone traveling for any reason. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is extremely caring and friendly. Locations are good and I find that Hampton Inns are consistent with their service and quality wherever they are.,1
"the staff very helpful and accommodating throughout the entire stay, breakfast was excellent and rooms were clean. pool was nice and clean and environment as a whole was very comfortable in feeling. location was close to much activities to participate in",1
"Clean spacious room, courteous staff, great breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that in addition to the warm breakfast, the Staybridge offered a light dinner Tues. through Thurs. We will definitely stay there again when visiting relatives in Columbia.",1
Nice hotel... pool was cold and could have been cleaned through the day,1
"Stay was good though parking a work vehicle is not practical. Main parking tight and deck is 7 max height, thought better height than others on beach.",1
"My husband, who is disabled, and I were going to use a friend's condo in Estes, but he was unable to access it. So...we had the dilemma of finding an accommodation in July during the Rooftop Rodeo! We, luckily, found Deer Crest resort. Ken and his wife have made this lovely riverside retreat a real pleasure. They went above and... More",1
Clean friendly easy to access from the highway. Good price with Beautiful rooms. Free breakfast and free wifi. The staff were amazing! I called at 10:05pm had a room 3 mins later. I will definitely go back here!!!,1
Took family of 4 (2 adults and 2 tweens) to Lafayette on business. Was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It has a nice floor-plan (we stayed in the one-bedroom with the pull-out sofa sleeper). Location possesses a 'secluded' feel. Every once in a while you'll hear a plane fly overhead or an automobile (if you are outside). Free covered parking... More,1
Good Hotel with Courteous staff. Good size room but very small bathroom. Close to downtown and major highways.,1
Enjoyed it greatly.,1
"Rooms are modern, attractive, and spacious. This was located perfectly for the sights we visited- the 3 pools, coast, and family visits. Staff is friendly, attentive, and helpful.",1
Hotel was probably built in the 50's. Needs serious update. Not really clean but not too terribly filthy. Landscaping was nice in the garden area and the pool was fairly nice but showed its age. The plus side is that you are literally steps away from the beach. We only stayed one night because we didn't sleep very well in... More,0
"Very friendly staff, but most of them have no knowledge about the area. Expensive for the area",1
"Very clean hotel, with friendly, efficient staff. Pool area was small, but impeccably clean and enjoyable. The hot breakfast was delicious and included omelets and waffles as well as cereals, breads/pastries, sausage, hash browns, hot chocolate, etc... Location good with multiple stores and restaurants nearby. The only minor flaw was the noise of the heat/air system, but definitely easy to... More",1
"If you have out of town guests, demand they stay here so you can eat on the roof! Great views. Downstairs in the restaurant, the view is nothing special, but the mini pizzas are good and not too expensive, given the setting.",1
Layout of the hotel and decor was too contemporary. The room was very comfortable,1
The maids were very helpful room was excellent! Melinda at the front desk was terrific too! As I had stated I needed to check in earlier than 4pm mu room wasn't ready I had to wait an hour and a half.,1
"We looked for a place around the Plaza but most of them were booked or way over priced. Stayed here for less than 100 a night and was very happy. The rooms are spacious, the service is excellent with a nice little bar by night and coffee shop by morning with Starbucks coffee. Received good advice on dining. Rooms were... More",1
"Very clean and friendly, enjoyed the room and comfort level it provided. Free continental breakfast and complimentary internet is always a plus, highly recommended for people visiting the Yorktown area as it is only around 10-15 miles away.",1
Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food,1
"Bad: The free shuttle maybe could be with reservation or something. Good: Clean, Tidy, Good breakfast, Nice bedrooms, Great Stuff. Recommended!!",1
"Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bunch of guys from another room having a party, being rowdy and getting drunk in parking lot right near office until 3AM. Clerk did nothing to quiet them down, call the police, etc. I was a little concerned when door to office locked at night and saw a sign for weekly rates. I will no longer stay in motels with outside doors. Accommodations would not have been terrible but I guess when room is too cheap, maybe doesn't attract best crowd.",0
Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...,1
"Great place to stay for reasonable price near Northpoint Mall. Very clean, moderate-sized, 6 foot something deep, indoor pool, and small hot tub. Staff VERY friendly and helpful! Good food at free Cont breakfast. Waffle House right across the parking lot if you are a late sleeper!",1
"Bad: There was no non slip surface in the bath or any grab rails in the bathroom, my husband slipped and fell out of the bath while having a shower. Luckily for us he only suffered shock and bruising. . Good: The room was a good size and had tea and coffee making tray. Bed was comfortable and the area quite, which was good after a long flight from uk. Breakfast was also good, a reasonable choice.",1
"We had a wonderful week at the Best Western in Lacey. Each day they would have different breakfast foods which was great. The room was very comfortable, the only issue was the size of the pillows. I thought they were too small for a king size room. I asked about them, but that was all they had. We would still... More",1
"I found a large bug in the bathroom, someone else's old coffee filter bag in the coffeemaker, shower curtain bar broken, and on a near freezing night (35 deg low), the heat didn't work, it only made a dangerous sounding electrical noise.",1
Pleasant and accommodating. It was the perfect rest stop while on business.,1
"My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel.",1
"Perfect location to be close enough to Cedar Rapids without paying higher rates, great place to catch the bike trail or head up to Waterloo. Affordable, cheap and clean.",1
"Everything was awesome. It was our second time staying at base camp, everyone there was just as friendly and helpful as the first time we stayed there last year. We are looking forward to returning during the summer season to enjoy the short walk to the lake.",1
"We stayed here for 3 nights in the Birch Lodge at the far end of Church Landing. The accommodations were impeccable albeit a bit dark. The bed was likely the most comfortable ever, and that says a lot since we have a wonderfully comfortable bed at home. Check in was easy, the lake beautiful, and easy access to the restaurants...

"Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly.",1
"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",1
This hotel/ motels located near the marina. The neighborhood is safe but I wasn't totally comfortable walking around at night.

We stay at this hotel any time we go to Nashville. Friendly Staff.. very nice rooms... good price. We love being close to so many nice restaurants and the Opry Mills Mall! We stay here with our children and their families every Thanksgiving weekend. Perfect for us!!!!,1
"Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa.",1
We were a famaily of 4. Great hotel. The lobby and the room were top class. Almost like a luxury hotel. Breakfast was included in the price. Excellent breakfast. Very happy to choose this one. Will come back next time.,1
"We had a great visit at the Comfort Suites. The hotel room was spacious (we had a small adjoining 'living room' space in addition to the bedroom), and the room was really clean. The bed was extremely comfortable (great pillows!). We had pleasant interactions with the front desk, who were more than happy to help us with any questions we... More",1

"I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in. But the another representative told me that Check-intime start from 16:00.16:00 2nd challenge to check-in. new another representative said the inspection of your room hasn't complete yet. wait for several minute the long line made by waiting check-in people were appeared from this time. 16:15 3rd challenge to check-in. next another representative said the inspection isn't yet.wait for 5-10min. I answered OK,I wait for at here(front desk) the long line has become much longer.16:50 4th challenge to check-in. no one tell me anything.I try to talk to another person who stand the next of front desk I am waiting for 45 minutes,Whyto tell you the truth,I had expected this time a little.because I thought this waiting time was the time to find the highfloor room I requested. 17:00 check-in done.the room assigned to me was...the most lowest floor(3rd).there are 20 floors in this hotel and I had requested higher floorsince 2 month ago,But the answer was the most lowest level.I was so sad...so sad. the attached picture is the View from this room.If the assigned floor was 4th floor,I think I was saved from this sadness.But 3rd...the most lowest floor to the guest who request high floor.I know this season is very busy.I don't want to complain more than that.The hospitality and smile of their staffs were very good.I'll stay this hotel again.maybe this month.Dear 376masatot, Thank you very much for feedback about your recent stay with us. I am terribly sorry to hear about your arrival experience and that your request for a room on a high floor could not be fulfilled. This is definitely not a typical St. Regis experience and on behalf of the entire team I would like to sincerely apologize.

"SUPER NICE HOTEL!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now.",1
"We were heading out early the next morning, so we did a quick overnight here. Hotel was clean and comfortable. Price was reasonable. Housekeeping responded quickly. The restaurant is mostly a grab-n-go type establishment, but the food was good.",1
Bad: Shower exposed to room. Good: The room was quiet and private.,1
"The room was clean but needs maintenance, wallpaper coming off the wall in the living room area of our suite. It is an older building and bathroom did not have extra outlet for appliances such as curling iron. It was nice and convenient having the kitchen. Good location! Convenient to many of the Arlington/ DC sites.",1
"Recently stayed for a business meeting and enjoyed the newly renovated room! Modern, clean with great city views. The location was walkable to restaurants and bars. The conference / event staff was courteous.",1
"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar.",0
"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable.",1
"You have to be prepared for anything at a hotel within this price range, but I was surprised to find that it was clean and decently maintained. The price was right for me, so I think overall it was worth it. I stayed there on a Friday night and didn't notice any loud people or drunks in the area.",1
"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,",1
"Our room was spacious, comfortable, and clean.",1
"This is a great hotel right on the beach. There are a lot of stairs down to the beach though, so it's not for older people.

I booked The Shore Hotel for a weekend stay after a Convention in Las Vegas. I found the hotel on Trip Advisor and after reading the very favorable reviews I decided to book it. When we arrived it was exactly how it looked on the website and right across the street from the beach. Upon check in our room as... More,1
I am extremely picky about cleanliness and beds and linens in hotels and I can say that this place has very high standards. The sheets on my bed must have been brand new. Pillows were thick and fluffy. The towels in the bathroom were thick and soft. Even the coffee maker and fridge in the kitchenette looked straight out of... More,1
"Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great.",1
The Hampton Inn is the best the breakfast was great the girls that keep it up are outstanding they sang to us every morning our rooms were exellent beds were excellent very comfortable the girls at the front desk were also awesome,1
"Loved the fireplace and full kitchen. WiFi could have been better. Loved the view from the living room. I will come back for special occasions in the future. Very cozy, but bedroom was not heated. We had to leave the bedroom door open and leave the gas fireplace on to heat the bedroom, but it still was a little cool.",1
"Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room. Super annoying and I'd say enough reason for any business traveller to avoid an otherwise super nice hotel. Good: The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect. The hotel feels new clean throughout. Nice atmosphere in the bar area.",1
"I reserved a room that turned out to be designed for a handicapped person, with all the fixtures, closet rods, ironing board, desks, etc., being much too low for my comfort. I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable. I spent my last night at a competing hotel for about the same price, without issue. Of course I did not reserve that room via Expedia.",1
"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.",1
"We stayed with the hotel April 17 thru the 19,2015 and had a wonderful stay. The owner and the women who helps keep the rooms clean Dorothy were truly accommodating. We have just booked another stay from May 17 thru May 22. Clean, whirlpool room with access to the internet and cable and a DVD/CD player and shuttle bus to... More",1

Hi we came across what we would say was 1 of the best hotels by chance as we had booked into the Don Cesar for 2 nights on arriving we were thoroughly disgusted by a few things so as it was late and the day before New Year's Eve we had to find somewhere to stay thankfully we were able... More,1
"Fantastic Fantastic, and fantastic!! It was just 40 and it was the best hotel I have ever went too and it was just a great experience, and I really loved it! I will come when ever I am in the area!",1
"The renovations in my room were very inconsistent. On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and have always been pleased, but this one was a cut above! I like that it was tucked back off the main street and very conveniently located. The room was pristine, while still being inviting and comfortable. The staff was excellent. I will be back!",1
"The two room suites are very clean an well maintained. We stay at Ocean Suites a couple of times a year and are always happy with the accommodations. The mini kitchen has a full size refrigerator, microwave, oven, coffee maker with coffee provided. Pots and pans along with dishes are provided. They even have coffee sweetener, a wine bottle opener,... More",1
"The staff was very friendly, especially Housekeeping. The breakfast offered a lot of variety. The hotel amenities were great. Good value for the price.",1
"Hotel looks very dark, weird smell 105 dollars per night. Complementary Internet and continental breakfast. Location is in French area very handy if u want to go out. Small pool of u want to swimming. 25 dollars parking.",0
"Bad: No Lobby, you have to breakfast in your own room. Good: No restaurant, breakfast is misearable, The widows of Aluminium very cold and curtains are noisy",1
2nd time there and both times could not get a towel for every person in our group. They would not let us have them. Every day we asked and every day told they would bring them and never did. Refrigerator/freezer did not work at all. They locked us out of our room twice and then told us it was our... More,0

"After visiting family and friends in Woodbury,TN we did as always, off to the mountains. For our needs, this Hampton was the most convenient which accepted pets, close to outlets and the most important, go karts. The outdoor pool was beautiful with a cozy fire pit. We will stay here again.",1
Good: Everything was amazing I will for sure be back!,1
"Not in the greatest area, but cant complain about the price per night. Hotel has been renovated, but has thin walls and has shaired doors with the rooms next door causing lots of the sounds to come from underneath. The doors are sturdy and solid, but makes a lot of noise when they close. Hotel is very close to the Amtrak and metro station, shuttles arived 10 min late but is available",1
"Okay value for money. No bugs, odors, or loud noises. The breakfast was considerably above average. The condition of the room needed upgrading: wall paper, bathroom door. Some lights (2) not working properly. We slept well.",1
"The room was fine, with two exceptions: I was placed in a room adjacent to the elevator shafts, and the wall air conditioning unit was excessively noisy. Consequently, even with ear plugs, it was not easy to get a good night's sleep for me. The A/C unit was easy to turn off, but it would have been difficult to prevent guests from using the elevators!",1
The room was nice and renovated . I tried to adjust the air upon arriving in a room which was 85 degrees. When we can back it was still the same and when we asked the desk they said the heat was still on and brought us a fan offered to give 10 off.We also paid for the room... More,1
"Good price on the rooms, the breakfast was fine but one of the rooms had bugs. The replacement room appeared to be bug free. I won't be going back.",0
Hotel was in decent shape and clean.  Bathrooms were very nice and redone but rest of room looked fine.  Main floor smelled of cat litter in some places and some others smelled like cleaning supplies.  Desk staff messed up my room keys when I checked in so I had to go all the way back to lobby to get it fixed.  Staff was friendly and apologized though.  Check out was smooth and easy.,1
"We enjoyed our stay at this suite hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. The AC unit in our room needed repair, and within 5 minutes, a maintenance staff member promptly arrived and had it fixed within 30 minutes! The front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions to transportation, local grocery stores within walking distance, even printing our boarding passes for our flight home! Thank you all!",1
Good: Close proximity to Freemont Street Experience.,1
"We were driving from Florida to North Carolina and thought that we would stop half way. I am glad we did, this is a very nice hotel to stay in. There are 3 of us and we each had our own bed and breakfast the next morning was great. The only thing we had an issue with was the parking... More",1
Friendly helpful staff when asked anything! Ease closeness to the airport was awesome! Didn't care for the Bistro! Would of prefer a continental breakfast offered instead! Overall it was a very nice safe place to stay!,1
"The experience here was less than satisfactory for many reasons. Firstly when we arrived with our rental car at about 4pm tired after a 15 hour flight and the need to fill in the day till check in time at 3pm, we were astounded to find the hotel completely roped off with no way in.

"The criteria for me to give 5 stars are: pleasant Front Desk, clean rooms, soft bed, quiet and good water pressure with an adequate free breakfast. Everything was a 5 star rating except the breakfast and the decor. This place must have been remodeled or is new.....it was unbelievable!! If I could I would like to give this hotel a... More",1
The hotel location was great close to the airport and other near by places.There was excellent shuttle service free of charge with exceptional drivers Food was great especially the free breakfast in the am where there was numerous choices. Customer service was ok but could be more informative to first time visitors,1

"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!",1
"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!",1

"Dreadful place to stay. Beyond belief that they can charge such an exorbitant rate for such inferior accommodation. We arrived late after an exhausting journey and just needed some sleep. Some hope.

We stayed ten nights at Grandma's Featherbed celebrating our ten year wedding anniversary in September. We were thrilled with our experience.

"I don't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews.Let me just say, we couldn't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel.I did feel sorry for the check in girl. She was alone and it was very busy, but she was very polite and nice.",0
We stayed here to go to Six Flags over Georgia en route to Florida. Upon check-in around 3:10 pm I was told our room wasn't ready but they were quick to find another room.

WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance.,1
"Bad: nil. Good: Good place if you don't want to be directly on the strip. Large rooms, clean and renovate, which is not always the case in Las Vegas. Perfect breakfast and very gooid service.",1
"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food.",1
"Staff was we'll familiar with area and points of interest. Me and my significant other travel often and are very picky with were we stay. We couldn't have picked a more comfortable place. Breakfast had a nice spread, and the staff made sure everything was just right.",1

Very satisfied with my stay and very affordable! The breakfast in the morning was great as well. It was a very easy process to check out in the morning. The employees that I walked past in the hallways were very friendly. Overall it was a very pleasant stay!,1
It is alittle hard to find Get detailed directions Fast airport pickup Very nice employees,1
"This hotel was clean and comfortable- my two biggest priorities for a hotel. The staff was courteous and went out of their way to accommodate our needs during the stay. We had a family crisis that necessitated leaving two days into a five day stay, and they were very understanding and supportive. The breakfast bar was beyond a continental muffins... More",1
"The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Perfectly located in the French Quarter and 1 block from Bourbon Street. I stayed in a petite room - but was impressed by the updated and clean rooms/bathrooms.

"The owners of this hotel are absolutely lovely! It's a wife and husband duo and you can tell they put a lot of sweat equity and heart and soul into running their lodge. The rooms were sufficient. We could tell that some updates had been made in recent years however, it was a hodgepodge of decorations. In the bathroom in... More",1
Bad: room was not ready til 530 kept being told to come back in 15 to 20 minutes more or less wasted the afternoon then when we got in the toilet backed up and it took 3 or 4 calls to the front desk to get it fixed another be there in 15 to 20 minutes about 3 hours. Good: location and patio area were great,1
We stayed at the Aria for a couple of nights in July 2016 as a starting point for our family road trip and found it to be an excellent hotel. It has been a long time since we had been to Las Vegas and quite a lot has changed in that time. It used to be a place where accommodation... More,1
"We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it.",1
"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments.",1
"This is another typical motel run down by the ownership of a person from India.

The swimming... More",0

"My wife got a message while we were there and loved it. Parking is a bit cluttered as they must park cars for people on Monhegan Island. Joe is a bit anal about the parking situation but is a real nice guy. Pat was great. We only stayed 2 days and could have stayed longer,",1
"This place is right on the bay. Has great amenities. Was unfortunately there to work so didn't have time to partake. Rooms were okay, a little dated. But staff was cordial and the location was perfect.",1

"We stayed at the Stage Stop Hotel on a Friday evening. I think we were the only guests, each taking a single room, with a queen size bed. The hotel is an old stage stop that was converted a very long time ago, the updates were also done a very long time ago, although not long enough to reinforce the... More",1
The hotel advertises a free breakfast but I went down to the breakfast area at 9:00 a.m. and everything was gone except for boxes of cereal and some not-very-nice looking fruit. The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair.,1
The sink kept backing up. The bathtub leaked. There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain. The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time. Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over. Jacuzzi was nice. room 118 beware,0
My family travelled to Anaheim for the winter break 2014. Now I know we only paid an average of 119 per night and i do not expect luxury at this price but I do expect things to work and the room to be clean. The room was gross. The outlets were falling out of the walls. They obviously do not... More,0
Overall great experience! The staff was excellent! I have never encountered such a friendly staff before my stay here! My only complaint would be the need for some updating in the showers....BUT other than that I absolutely would recommend to everyone!,1
Bad: Way overpriced. Room was overdesigned faux industrial window box. Bed not comfortable at all. Good: Great location,1
"I wanted quiet with no amenities. I thoroughly enjoyed and used the wave sound machine in the room. I enjoyed the crabby hour one of the two nights I stayed. Staff and shuttle service were extrememly helpful and timely. I could walk all over the Inner Harbor and keep my car parked in an adjacent lot. Due to bad weather, I was able to just walk to the restaurant attached and have an excellent meal.",1
"Great hotel with great proximity to Cambridge and Harvard. Restaurants, services and gym are fantastic. Pricey but generally worth it. Connected to large independent fitness club so no fears of arriving in the morning and finding all the equipment taken. Henrietta's Table restaurant is great for breakfast - either business breakfast or with family.",1
"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day.",1
"Beds not very comfortable, and the price was quite steep (even realizing it was Labor Day weekend and many Inns raise their rates) otherwise: very clean, well-appointed, convenient to many dining places and lake activities.",1
Rolled in 11:30 laid out heads down woke up to continental breakfast and rolled out at daybreak. It is under construction but heat they have done so far is beautiful. Very nice updated pool area for an older motel. The staff was super nice,1
"The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice.",1

This is motel type place but renovated to modern standards with good fixtures. 2 Queen bedrooms are very spacious and clean. No breakfast here but it is close to many restaurants.",1
"Hotel options in and near to Leesburg are limited so we chose the Hampton Inn Suites.

"Arrived late. Room was clean, very nice linens, good Wi-Fi connection. Left early the next day and six hours later, discovered I left a vest there. I called the hotel and spoke to Nash. He contacted housekeeping and found it. Shipped it out to my next destination. Excellent service!",1
"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!",1
"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff.",1
"Excellent small hotel, nicely decorated, our room overlooked the marina which was not busy during a cold snap. Nice harbor view. TV should be updated but gave a clear picture.

Wedding party outside in pool area until 4:30 in morning. Very loud. Front desk was ignorant to whole event even tho you could see outside tables from lobby.

"Carl was great. Carl was the concierge and he helped us with touring New Orleans. The rooftop was the best part of the hotel. It had a stylish bar and a view of the city that you only get from this hotel Thank you so much for taking the time to share this feedback about your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had an excellent stay. You are correct in stating how wonderful the view is from our Monkey Board Rooftop Bar and also about the job Carl does as our concierge. We appreciate having you stay with us and hope to have you back for another stay real soon.Best regards,",1
"I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door. However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel.",1

"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny.",1
"It's very nice! And they have by far, the best continental breakfast with all the trimmings! We will definitely come back here.",1
"For someone who had never visited New Orleans before, I could confidently say that the troubadour staff made me feel like I was at home. I was told about all of the fantastic restaurant and bars that weren't tourist traps. The front desk staff provided quite a bit of useful information about the city and were a fantastic resource that answered all of my questions. My room was always immaculate and the housekeeping team was able to accommodate all of my requests. I look forward to my next stay soon.Thank you for sharing your experience.

"This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first.",1
Very good experience. Staff was great. Enjoyed my times especially after my previous fiasco at that other hotel.,1
"Bad: Shower liner needs replacing. Upgrade of toilet tissue. Also, would be very nice to have Alittle something to pick up an eat, in the morning, in the lobby area. Good: Bed very comfy! Coffee in room Loved the delicious cookies you had in the lobby area, along with the wonderful fruited water!!!!! Our favorite!!!! That was just perfect in the late afternoon after coming back from Williamsburg!!",1
"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish. Price was decent since it was off-season, that's when we choose to stay overnight most anywhere. We would def stay there again!",1

"We stayed here one night, because it was the end of our family vacation, and we ended up staying too late to leave/drive home. So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area, and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week. The beds and pillows were so nice and fluffy, the floors were new and nice not dirty. There was a micro, fridge, and coffemaker. The tv was a flat screen. The bathroom was newly redone and very nice. Was happy i didn't have to be scared.",1
"We were very disappointed in this hotel. The cable was out our entire stay, the pool was not filled (in july) and the bar/restaurant was closed. We wernt told about any of this. Was not worth the amount we paid. Very disappointed!",0
"This an older motel, but kept in great condition by the owners. Very clean and quiet. Park the motorcycle right outside your room. Reasonalble rates too. Would definitely recommend. For the motorcyclists...ride up to Lake of the Clouds...worth the ride and nice, scenic roads in the area. Ask for an old towel from the owner to clean the bike. Access... More",1
"Room was well-appointed and clean comfortable bed, good value, pleasant stay. It was convenient to Texas Rangers ballpark, easy to get to, would stay there again. Staff was friendly and efficient. Breakfast had good choices.",1
I enjoyed it,1
"We are fans of the Drury chain but did not love this one. We are always disappointed when hotel windows don't open because we can't get fresh air and must have the A/C turning on and off all night, and that was the problem here. In addition, the walls were a bit thin allowing noise from next door to reach... More",1
This is one of the best employee and breakfast experiences you are going to get in the Lacey area. I have started to choose this over more opulent places if I am allowed to choose it for work. The staff are top-notch friendly and the breakfast is one of the best I've experienced.,1
"Upon checking in, the front desk couple was super friendly. I'm guessing they were the owners maybe The room was spotless. I was super happy to see that the window opened so I could listen to the waves crashing while I relaxed. I had a room with a queen bed, it also had a table w/ chairs, a loveseat, comfortable... More",1
"Very helpful staff at check in. Stayed in room 201. Had some fairly stompy people in the building, which you could hear quite a bit. Solved this by running the fan all night wasn't a problem anymore. Easy to get to along a winding Canyon Road. Plenty of restaurants close on Wisconsin Dells Parkway. Nice beach area, pool and patio.",1
"Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect.",1
"Stayed here for business for one night. Hotel is clean, bed was comfortable and staff was friendly. Hotel was quiet and quick access to the freeway. There are plenty of fast food places to grab a quick bite. I would stay again for work.",1
It was a good clean stay.,1
"Overall very pleased with hotel. Though there technically was plenty of space, the porta-crib barely fit between the beds. Room was very clean. Liked having the fridge. Bathroom clean. Wifi worked well. Good selection of tv channels, though we didn't watch it too often. Maid did go in one day while we were out despite the do not disturb sign being on door, which makes me uncomfortable, but it was all good. Breakfast was nice in having many choices. Area wasn't first choice, but we weren't going to pay those prices. Convenient to most everything we wanted to do.",1
"Nice hotel, staff were the best I have interacted with in years. Accommodations were very clean.",1
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends.",1
Staff was very friendly and went out of way to answer question about surrounding area. Our room was very clean and accommodating. Free breakfast was one of the best we have had. While we were eating we saw someone straightening and cleaning area 3 times. Everything was great. Would stay here again if ever in the area.,1
Our stay was beyond my expectation and I called right before closing and Christine booked me right over the phone and even left the keys in our room to accommodate our stay. If your looking for a spot to relax and have a great time this is the spot you want to stay in. The three people that were extremely... More,1
This is a wonderful facility in an unexpected location. We had a wonderful time. The soaker tub meet expectations. The fireplace made it very cozy. The breakfast and evening lounge were such a nice amenity. We hope to go back soon!,1
Came Memorial day weekend. Great weather.Enjoyed Rolling Thunder. Visited many venues.,1
"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.",0

Power went out at only this property for several hours. Staff was not equipped to deal with it. Breakfast in the morning the worst ever at a Hampton Inn. Total cut corners property. Will not stay again,0
"We stayed here in November and had a wonderful stay. The restaurant, room service, bar and spa are amazing! Worth every penny and a place to experience! The shrimp and grits breakfast item is amazing!",1
It was fun to relax with a beer and a great burger and watch bustling 3rd Avenue. We had an enjoyable visit with our college son up from UO and his buddies and our daughter. very enjoyable.,1
Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More,0
"Not so bad if your there just to fish, good enough to lay your head,after a long day nite of fishing, I will stay there again! Can't beat the price. Real close to the pier, Don't have to drive any where, The pier has all you need!!",0
No evening receptions was not nortified of not having one on Thurday or Monday during my stay. Came in lobby there was nothing. None of staff front desk said anything about not having the evening reception,1
"Love all the stuff included, free softdrinks free snack bar in the evening, free hot breakfast. Great location for walking to Busch Stadium, Edward Jones Dome, the Arch.

My daughter and I stayed overnight here before her cosmetology state board test.

I checked in very late and was informed by the very nice guest services rep that they had oversold the hotel for the evening. I've traveled extensively and this happens occasionally and I wasn't really upset and she said they had me set up with a complimentary evening at a nearby hotel if I didn't mind a 10 minute drive....

L'hotel e a 20 minuti da Washington ma si raggiunge facilmente grazie ad una superstrada e il prezzo e molto conveniente rispetto alle grandi catene presenti in citta.,1
"Lovely grounds. We had a very nice one bedroom condo on 8th floor, mountain view. Full kitchen. We stayed 15 nights and having more room (745 sq ft) made a difference. The cleaning service was a bit of a joke, however: only every other day, mainly to change the linens. Outdoors the space was pretty but not very functional. I... More",1
"Loved the location of this hotel so much! We could walk everywhere. Also, the room was a little outdated and the beds were a little small, but the bathroom was new and updated.

"staff was very helpful,breakfast included really makes a difference when you travel.clean and close to all major roads. this location also makes it nice due to a walking down down type of area with shops and many types of eateries available. also a food stor in the next parking lot.",1
I enjoyed my recent stay and will stay here again next month when I return on business. I was especially pleased with the helpful front desk staff as well as the restaurant team. The breakfast each day was quite good as well.,1
"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager",1
The hotel is greatly unappreciated for the potential of the service and accomodations. The initial appearance is unfortunate because the facilities could be very nice if kept up. My room was very comfortable and was a bargain for the money.,1
"Travelling all the way from Louisiana to New Hampshire with a friend and a 10 month old pup we needed a pet-friendly hotel. I will say the management is interested in our thoughts, as they did respond to my review, so they are trying. This is an OLD hotel with renovated interiors. That still smell like smoke when the room... More",0
"Bad: Ridiculously noisy, external alarms, cars honking horns through the night and the thumping music till early hours made sleep tricky ! Not a hotel if you like a little peace in the evening. Good: The property location was perfect",1

This Quality Inn is in a great location and the staff is amazing. Beds were comfortable and very clean I was impressed with how large and spacious the rooms are. I could go on and on about how happy I am with my stay. I will see you again when I am passing through again this weekend.,1
Stayed here overnight to go to fedex field. Very close to metro and the hotel will take you to and pi k you up from the metro station. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms nice and clean. All we needed or our two night stay. Area directly surrounding hotel a little hard to navigate and not a lot of choices. Couple of nice eateries within 5 min walk.,1
"Bad: it was all good. Good: lovely rooms, helpful staff, fast wifi, and nice gym",1
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel overnight on our way back from a trip to NC from PA. We arrived after the normal check-in time, but we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready. After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am.",1

Also no corkscrew or cheese cutter which should be included. Good: The units were modern and well cared for. The price was good for the location. The layout of the unit was good.

This is an excellent property. It really fits the resort catagory. The king bed I had was very comfortable and the room had enough space to relax and work. Evry room has a balcony.

"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",1
My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions.,1
Great stay would definitely stay here again,1
I reserved this room on hotels.com for a quick trip to take my son to a doctors appointment. When i received my credit card statement I discovered that the hotel had also charged me. The hotel has not refunded me nor had hotels.com refunded me.,0
"On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you.",1
If you decide to book this hotel you will be disappointed.,0

Caminar desde la ultima estacion de metro hasta el hotel, se hace agradable y cerca de alli hay lugares para comer. Si no te gusta caminar, tienen shuttle bus y vas y vienes en el. Diversidad de opciones de comida. El precio es una buena razon para esto. Es barato a pesar de la temporada.",1

Our one night stay at the Modern was the perfect complement to our introduction to Boise. Hip and retro-modern rooms were beautiful and comfortable (the bed!) and spotless.

"We had a microwave and fridge in the room. The room showed typical wear-and-tear of most moderately priced motels, but overall it was clean and the bed was comfortable, though a bit high.

I recently stayed the night at this motel and I must say this place was better than I expected. The rooms were very clean and very nice. The owner who is a 3rd generation owner treat me very polite. I felt like I was staying with family! He cares about his legacy and does his best to make sure you are safe and comfortable. Thank you.,1
"We stayed here for the third time for our 5th anniversary. This hotel is definitely expensive for the area, but well worth the price. It's the kind of place where you want to luxuriate in the hotel itself, not just a bed for the night.",1
"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment. Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence. Thank You once again",1
Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy,1
Bad: Didn't feel the room was what was portrayed when booked. Good: Nice temp outside breezy and could leave the windows open,1

"This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!",1

"This Hampton Inn provides the usual predictable quality. Building is quite old. Breakfast area is very small. Exercise room is a converted former guest-room. Single piston-driven elevator is slow. This property is right off of Interstate-90. As such, there is a great deal of road noise. Try to get a room with a lower number, this will put you farther... More",1
"Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away.",1
"I feel as though I am getting boring and repetitive. Ho, hum just another excellent experience during our visit to New England. Trish was very helpful making suggestions of where to visit, scenic routes to take to get there and making sure we did not foolishly take our car to Marthas Vineyard. Megan (sp) was especially pleasant to deal with.",1
"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time.",0

The free breakfast was excellent, the 5:30 happy hour was a bonus with its 3 free drinks and the central location to the Arch, Busch stadium and Edward Jones stadium was perfect ! For this price and compared to the... More",1
"We stayed the night at this hotel the night before our family reunion. I made reservations, so I take the blame for this. The room was exactly what it looks like on the pictures. It was clean. There was a smell in the room that I still cannot determine. There were many people in the parking lot. It looked as... More",0

"The hotel itself wasn't bad. The location worked for my purpose and the lobby was clean, staff friendly, etc. my room was a bit on the gross side. The couch had stains on it, the rug by the bathroom looked like someone missed and in the morning the toilet backed up, confirming my impression of the rug stains. I couldn't wait to get to the next stop so I could feel clean again!",1

I always seem to have a great time at Le Meridien. I generally stay on the club level floor and it is always good. The attendants in the lounge during breakfast are always great.

"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene.",1
"Bad: Nothing, I cherished my stay here. Good: This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards from the busy beach front, just far enough for it to be quiet through the night, the veiw from the rooftop pool was exquisite, the rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest standard. Loved it",1

"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything.",0
"We stayed at the Waterfront for two nights in August. Very nice hotel. The staff was helpful, especially the valet service -- those guys had my car ready every single time within minutes. They even had a complimentary shuttle that took us to a restaurant our first night there.",1
Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway.

"Nice large rooms, but our A/C did not work well, especially in the bedroom. This was a higher priced King Corner Suite. Only stayed for 1 night, so told front desk staff on the way out. Happy hour is a nice idea, but no way to get near the small and understaffed bar to get a drink. Could not check in at 1:00, had to wait until 3 pm, which is the rule, but would have been nice to find a room earlier. Breakfast was very good.",1

"Stayed for a weekend trip in Chicago. Hotel is in the perfect location in the city centre. Walking distance to Millennium Park. Great room - compl. upgraded was provided to us so we had 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms so the room was very spaces and was always kept clean. Complimentary water bottles are refill stations on every floor as well as coffee on level 2. Staff is amazing and have great advice on restaurants and places to visit. Only issue with my room was that it looked out towards trump tower - not exactly what you want to wake up to each day.Hello Helen D,Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel during your recent travels. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your complimentary upgrade and enjoyed the extra space. We are very lucky to be right in the middle of the city and within walking distance to all major attractions.

"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!",1
"We stayed here for one night after driving up from the Tampa airport to Orlando area to meet family that has already arrived.

Very nice hotel with the exception of the bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable.,1
"Bad: The television was so small that it could barely be seen from the bed. The fitness room was way below par, only two working machines. And, the HVAC in the room was balky, loud, clunky and less than adequate. Good: Location for me was excellent. Breakfast was a real value and the size of the room was really large.",1
This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles.,1
Hotel was very clean and room was ready upon arrival.,1

Our swim team was in the area for a meet and stayed here. The staff was very accommodating to the group (especially given our size). The rooms were clean and what you would expect. The kids had fun at the pool. I'm guessing this will be our hotel again when we come next year.,1
"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.",1
"The main lobby and dining areas were clean. The room was musty and damp. The floor on one side of the bed was damp and sticky. Breakfast was alright - no healthy options, but it was fine.",1
"I was satisfied for choosing Best Western. I try to always choose a Best Western because of there cost/ benefits of stay comparison. I feel that I get what I pay for and it is reasonable. I didn't expect a pool, so that was a surprise that I was grateful for, as well as my son.",1

The hotel offered all the amenities for a great experience. Every detail was met. We arrived late and left early so we were unable to do much but noted all of them. The shower head (several options) and temp of the water was great for our much appreciated arrival was awesome!,1

"Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big.",1

I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room.",1

Loved the breakfast: all the breakfast items you expect, plus fruit, yogurt, and vegetarian and gluten-free selections, too. Great job!",1
We pick the Aria for laid back location and the modern feel. The staff seems to care. Yes we lost all our gambling funds but the atmosphere and vibe was worth it. It is a special place..great for the modern crowd but not extremely trendy...,1
"The hotel was just ok. I picked this place for the advertised free parking. Unfortunately, the parking area was small and not near big enough to hold the guests cars. Adding to this issue, many of the employees were utilizing the free parking and there was not enough room for the guests. I had to park on the street 2... More",0
Recently stayed for 2 weeks in the Paddock area of saratoga springs. Great location..just a short walk to the paddock pool and padfock grill...also 2 mins from either carousel or paddock bus stop. Short and very pleasant 5 min walk to the main springs pool and artists pallete restaurant and main lobby. Pool was amazing..never over crowded. Room ..studio..was very... More,1
"Clean and well maintained, convenient to the airport, a half mile walk to any stores, staff friendly. Would stay again for airport access but it's definitely not quiet with all the highway noise.",1
The hotel staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. Check-in was a breeze.,1
Not bad for the price. Some highway noise. Guest can not come to your room without you coming to down to get them.,1
The front staff was friendly and helpful. She was able to accommodate me in a first floor room knowing I had twins and the hotel does not have an elevator. The room looks great. My only problem was that a roach crawled on my phone. After that I questioned the cleanliness of the room.,1
"The people at front desk were very helpful when I couldn't get my wifi to work. It's nothing special, but sufficed. I was there for the tennis tournament, so just needed a safe place to stay and it worked. There was a shuttle to the tennis venue which was great.",1
"I enjoyed my stay at this apartment(even though they were still renovating). The place was very nice,spacious and you didn't feel as though you were bumping heads with others in the apartment. It was like a home away from home.",1
"I love so many things about The Viceroy. It's in a perfect location right in the heart of Santa Monica. The staff is friendly and helpful, the design is beautiful, the common areas are gorgeous, rooms are smaller but very nicely appointed and the pool is small and somewhat shaded but overall it's a wonderful hotel.",1
"Awesome place, got it at a great deal. Room was spacious and clean, Customer service people were very nice and respectable. Would definitely want to stay again when in that area.",1
We stayed one night on our way to the Redwoods. They're doing renovations. They will have beautiful gardens outside each room. I thought it's going to be lovely. My husband and grandson had a hard time with the renovations going on. Each room has a private patio looking at the gardens. The room was clean and comfortable. I'd like to... More,1

"Wanted a Hotel close to Joshua Tree NP and this one filled the bill being in Twnetynine Palms, Truthfully I picked based on the look of the pool. Checked in and was upgraded to a suite, nice but was a little worried after finding they were at the front of the hotel, no problems the bedroom was at the rear... More",1
Fabulous resort. Great location. Big resort if that's what you are looking for. Gorgeous grounds beach location. Great staff.,1
The hotel was great! The check in/out was quick and simple. The employees at every level were very courteous. The restaurant in the hotel had great food. Rooms were very clean and had a great view of the ocean. The amenities were great. The hotel was located near great shopping and seafood restaurants. I will stay here again for all of my future vacations to Virginia Beach.,1
Good: Staff was wonderful! The location perfect. Nice breakfast,1
This is a great hotel walking distance to Disneyland friendly staff clean rooms great price will stay again,1
Great little hotel. Front desk staff was great with recommendations to nearby restaurants etc. Noise was not bad at all. Had a room with an outside view. Was very clean and the bathroom was nice as well as the shower. There was a Starbucks right downstairs inside the hotel for coffee in the morning. The bar and lounge looked really... More,1
"The bed was good in room 110. The bathroom was massive without shelving, and thus there was no place to set things. Outlets were in short supply. Room was spacious and clean. Overall for the price it was good. But seriously put some shelves in the bathroom for my wife. And have a wheat free breakfast option.",1
Bad: A little pricey. Good: Staff members were very nice. The food at the hotel's restaurant was extremely delicious. Walking distance to the beach and many other restaurants on Ocean Drive. The rooms were clean and spacious.,1
The Pier 5 Hotel is at a great Baltimore location at the Inner Harbor. It is one of the smaller hotels but size isn't important. The convenience to the harbor and restaurants is terrific.,1
"Worked OK for an overnight stop along I-57. Convenient to I-57, although internet-generated directions can be a little confusing, but local resident had no problem finding. Nothing fancy or too modern, but clean. Didn't have time to check the pool or other amenities.",1
"The third night, we stayed at the Baymont in Kissimmee. They have an elevator, though it was less torturous to climb two flights of stairs. We had two queen beds. Linens were clean. Mattresses were comfortable. The refrigerator was warmish, the microwave looked brand new. Every time in used my device, I had to sign into the free wi-fi again.... More",1
The rooms was excellent the breakfast was great with a very good price.,1
"Served it's purpose... room is clean and comfortable, bathroom has very limited spaces..",1
I was not too impressed with the hot tub or breakfast. Besides a clean room and comfortable bed those two things are important to me. One morning they were out of items at breakfast.,1
Bad: The sofa is heavily soiled. Good: I like the feel of the Villa like an apartment home instead of cold hotel room,1
"Close to port and airport. Next door is a McDonalds. Rooms are clean. Not recommended for a vacation place. You can drive to the restaurants, beach and shops . They cater to the pre and post cruisers and flyers. We had to catch a plane at 7am. and it was great for that. Thats about it.",1
"We spent about 16-17 hours traveling 1,000s of miles before reaching the hotel. It was our first time in California as a family and the first time we had traveled that far with our toddler. We got to our hotel room at 8:00 that night and were getting settled in when we had a knock on our door. We were... More",0
"Bad: Young girl on front desk was very abrupt. Good: For us the location was great,a nice 10 min walk to the strip. Nice clean rooms. Nice pool and hot tub.",1
"Both the evening and morning staff working the front desk were outstanding. They were busy with guest, breakfast, both cooking and serving, helping guest with requests even finding an empty room where I could dry my hair as the dryer in our room was not working all the while she was very busy with check outs and breakfast.",1
"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager",1
"This is a newer hotel so the property shines. Yet even newer hotels can lose their luster without great staff. The attitudes by everyone in this property were excellent during my entire stay...Front Desk Staff, Breakfast Staff and Housekeeping. If you want to feel welcomed and valued during a trip to Columbus this property should be considered. Their training and... More",1
"The hotel is in a good location near Oak mall. However, the receptionist was not there when I came to check in. It took me more than a minute standing waiting for her. She was there and probably heard me entering. The room was big and well equipped, but there wasn't a shampoo and there was a weed smell around... More",1
"My daughter and I stayed here on 4/14, while attending the Ariana Grande concert. We had to be at Key Arena at 3, and we were allowed to check in at 1pm.

"I went to the Pine Barn for a baby shower and it was beautifully decorated, quiet and wonderful service. So wonderful to have a historic Inn in our area!",1
"The Best Western is a great hotel and right in the heart of Sedona! It's a quick walk to shops and restaurants. It's also a quick drive to various state parks, Cathedral Rock, Chapel of the Christ Church, etc. The hotel staff were great and the pool and other amenities (fitness center, game room, etc.)were fantastic. I highly recommend this... More",1
"stayed here for a dog show weekend. Really appreciate being able to keep my dog with me here. Grounds are well maintained, but I did step in another dog's feces outdoors...dog bags would be great and a handy trash can. Room was clean and quiet and close to dining and museaums and 81. Bedding was lacking however - thin and even an extra blanket did not help much. Shower rocked and loved having a bathtub. Refridgerator never did get cold and the food I brought spoiled. good breakfast.",1
"After the manger saw that i was on crutches he moved me to the first floor in the same type of room, which was great for them to do for me. Bed was great, hot tub was awesome, and staff is amazing. Thanks for a great stay!",1
"This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit.",0
"Our room was very nice and very clean. Stayed in a suite which offered very nice full kitchen options along with a gas fireplace. Lighting in the toilet/tub area needs to be brighter but that is a minor complaint. Towels could have been better quality but, again, in the grand scheme of things, I've had much worse. The front desk... More",1
"I travel at least once per year and as far as all the hotels I've been to, this has been the best by far. The food, service and room was probably the best that I've experienced. I've been to Vegas 4 times now and used to stay at Cesar's but this place doesn't compare with anything else in Vegas. Between... More",1
The room was very clean and newly remodeled. The staff was pleasant. The only problem we had was the doors do not fit right and the slamming of the doors on the 4th floor was extremely loud. We have stayed at a lot of Hampton Inns and never experienced this problem with the room exit door.,1
"The rooms at this motel are fine and the breakfast was sufficient but the wifi availability is terrible. In addition, I had to stand by the lobby front door or go outside to keep my cell phone calls from breaking up or dropping as did others in our party. Also, the bathroom door automatically closes unless you prop it open... More",1
Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb,1
Great place to stay for a few days while visiting Maine.,1
"Needed hotel near office location in Tampa and Hilton is always my first choice.This Hilton Garden Inn was a hidden gem. Warm welcome with cookies, coffee, and water in the lobby. Room was average but I felt safe and slept really well which is unusual for me at a hotel! Will definitely stay here again and recommend it.",1
Great place to stay in Madison. The rooms are very quiet and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the shower is fabulous. Our large dogs loved the special dog treat bag they each received which is a thoughtful addition to the room package! We will be back :),1
"A very nice motel in the center of the city. As usual, the service was excellent. I reported a minor problem with the TV in the fitness center and it was promptly repaired the next morning. This motel has the best rate in Grand Island for business travel for government employees. Consider the Best Western any time you are staying... More",1
"This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again.",0
It wasnt the best but its a great price.... beds were comfy pillows were nice.... and they have free breakfast i think its a good hotel if your looking to be somewhere near the parks withot having to pay resort or in park hotel resort prices,1
"Very clean, comfortable room. Staff was helpful and attentive. Decent fitness area. The hotel is situated central to some decent restaurants and you can dine on site too. I will stay there again next time I visit.",1
"Well ran and very nicely maintained. Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I enjoyed conversations with both the evening and day shift. Breakfast was well prepared and varied to suit different tastes. Location is good for walking to shops and driving up Oak Creek Canyon. Lots of little places to relax on the grounds. Beds were comfortable and the accessible... More",1
I had a meeting at this hotel so it was the one that was arranged for me. My flight arrived at 11:30am and I noticed by checking the website the hotel doesn't have check-in until 4pm. I ate lunch at the airport and then called to see about an early check-in. Jake answered the phone and looked up my reservation... More,1
"the hall was very nice, food was great and the staff was the best. however, they didn't do a couple of thing right that I specifically asked for and I had to a few times during the night remind them of a couple of things.",1
"Its old, worn out and a bit dingy. Centrally located amongst a number of good bars and places to eat is the only reason I stay here. At least the sheets are always clean.",0
Very clean. Breakfast was good and a variety each morning. Many different choices. We stayed for 5 nights. Staff friendly and helpful. Property was very well kept and pleasant. Would definitely stay again.,1
Great hotel. Clean and comfortable with a very good breakfast.,1
"location and staff were great! Room, not so much. Trash wasnt emptied, hair in tub and top comforter on one bed didnt look to clean. Price and location were main reason for chosing this place -again staff and breakfast were nice",0
"Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!",1
The cold and hot water faucet was not working. Bath faucet could not control cold and hot water mix and hot water burned my body,1
Everything was great with the hotel except our bathroom. There was no bathtub. I believe it was probably a handicap room. Not having a bathtub caused water to go all over the floor which caused me to slip on the floor.,1
"I have spent many visits at this hotel..The staff is very friendly and helpful.. The rooms are spacious and always clean..I always feel welcome there.. I am greeted like a friend.. All remember me, even housekeeping..The breakfast is always hot and ready for anyone .. there is always someone at the front desk for your every need..I will return anytime... More",1
"Not only did the shower for my room not have hot water (so they gave me another room but still it was inconvenient when I was rushing to catch a train), but the new room they assigned me to had extremely hot water running in the toilet! (I could tell by the steam and intense heat coming from the toilet after flushing). The hotel definitely has been very well refurbished and the condition of everything is of high quality, EXCEPT that it doesn't seem they've worked out all of their plumbing details yet.",1
Quiet. Clean. Friendly. Reasonable. What more could i ask for,1
It is a newer property that is probably not more than a year old. Standard breakfast and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The beds are a little more firm than usual Hampton Inn beds but they are ok. The check in process was quick and I used the online check in so. My room was ready. I had no... More,1
"Bad: Noise, small room, exposed nails in carpet. Good: Locations",0
"Very enjoyable. The breakfast was excellent, just get down early. The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and the nightly shuttle offers service to the shops. It was great.",1
This hotel is in an area of Richmond that is less than desirable. We booked it because it wasn't far from Richmond airport where we arrived late evening and didn't want to travel far our first night in Virginia. Waited at front desk for 15 minutes before someone showed up to check us in. The price was right and the... More,0
Very accommodating. The rooms were clean and the staff was very pleasant. The very was definitely one of the best. Made me and my family feel welcomed the second we got there. Beautiful facility and very well kept,1

"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time! Such great service! Rooms were very clean and well maintained with great views of the city! I will be back, thanks!Hi Michael, Thanks for the great review!! Glad we were able to help get you to work on time. Your coming back is what matters most to us!See you then!Evan",1
"This hotel was clean and comfortable with all the amenities we were looking for. There was a fridge, which we wanted to place our cooler items into to keep from spoiling during our trip through a few states. We enjoyed the location, as we walked across the street for supper and stopped at a couple of the many casinos a... More",1
"Just spent three nights over the Fourth of July. I am 83 so climbing the narrow , steep back stairs was a little difficult. Always seemed to be a very musty smell when coming in that door.

I tell any one in the area to stay here...I stay here every time I'm in the area...It's great! Very clean and the staff is wonderful...It's close to restaurants and really any place you want to go...You just can't beat this hotel,1
Bad: The pillows were too bulky. Good: I loved the convenience. Everything we needed was right there.,1
"Comfortable room, continental breakfast was terrible though.",1
"Great vision combined with high energy ,pushing hospitality into a my first stay in this aloft brand . Rates were reasonable. Location was great. Clean room. Large shower . Comfortable bed. Pet friendly. Other than thin walls , was pleased with Staff, modern theme, large clean room and shower area. Great! We have converted another happy guest and we are so glad that you gave us the chance. Thanks for trying out Aloft New Orleans Downtown.",1
Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most,1
"Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market. The staff at the hotel were very friendly from the moment we approached the outside of the hotel to the front desk, life guard at the pool and servers during the free breakfast. Great experience!",1
"We stayed over night so we could catch an early flight the next morning. The motel provided transportation to the airport. They were so nice about it! They gave us a free sample beer the night before, and free coffee the next morning. We would have been given breakfast, too, but we had to leave too early.",1
"We stayed here for our honeymoon five years ago. We enjoyed our stay so we just stayed again this past week. We were able to get the same room thank you Paula with upgrades and new amenities . Rooms are very clean, quaint, cozy and staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel. We have already... More",1
"We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan",1
"We arrived here very tired after 24 hours of travel and airports and from the moment we arrived we felt like royalty. We dined a Amaya multiple times (please see separate review). The room was stunning and more than we could ever expect, nothing was to little for the staff and they all seemed genuinely friendly even down to the... More",1
"Coconut Waikiki is a very nice Hotel, just far enough away from the main touristy areas to suit us.

There is also a laundry room and... More",1
A clean and well kept place with a friendly staff. Easy on off from I-77 Good breakfast close to restaurants and next door to a gas station. A better Quality Inn would surely stay again. Neal Ellen E,1

The breakfast was tasty with a variety of items from breakfast sandwiches, cereal, oatmeal, waffles, bagels, various juices, fruit, and yogurt. The amenities were plenteous. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return when we come back to the area.",1
We had a great stay at Inn By The Lake! We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite. Great sized living area with well equipped kitchen and a separate bedroom. Sleeper sofa in living room. Bathroom was big with jacuzzi tub. Nice little balcony and huge windows across the living room facing the lake. Room was super clean. A bit... More,1
"I have never stayed at such a nice Days Inn before. The room and bathroom were huge. So clean and new looking. Ladies, the bathroom had the longest granite counter I have ever seen. The sink, shower, and toilet were so clean and sparkly....I was really impressed. Very friendly clerk and spotless breakfast room. I definitely recommend this hotel.",1
"First time staying at a My Place hotel..room was wonderful, large and clean. Beds were very comfortable. Loved the kitchenette with the full sized fridge. Check in was quick and the staff were very friendly. Will definately stay here again..",1
"I made a reservation through Expedia. I'd read an article saying that all the rooms had been refurbished, so I thought I was OK. A day before our stay I looked at the Alamo's web site, which advised that one needs to call the motel to get a refurbished room. I tried calling them over the course of 4 hours... More",1
"I was very disappointed in the Wingate by Wyndham LaGrange. I initially liked the hardwood floors when we entered our room- definitely cleaner than carpeting. However, it sounded like the guests above us were moving furniture around and doing some serious stomping until about 3 am. Carpeting would have muted some of this noise. Our room air conditioner sounded like... More",0
"This was a great stopover on our way to LA. Helpful staff. Rooms were very nice. Great for family travel. Lancaster was a bit out of the way but it worked fine for a late night and early morning.

Loved it. Had a wonderful stay.,1
The Interior Renovations and design are very nice. Very comfortable and quite.,1
"Average hotel. Staff was nice. Hotel is a little bit dated. A little far from Chattanooga, but located in pretty area. No drinking water provided with breakfast. Pool water was very cold. Contenital breakfast was average.",1
"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.",1
"All of the staff we encountered seemed genuinely interested in making our experience the best possible. They were all very accommodating, starting at the front desk the moment we checked in. There was no pretentiousness whatsoever. How very refreshing.",1
"Wonderful place right on the Hollywood Beach Broadwalk (spelling is correct). The place has some of the most friendly and helpful hotel staff I've ever encountered, especially the front desk manager, Yolanda. This applies as well to the operations manager, Galina and to the rest of the staff including Elena, Flavia,Nikki,Nikita,Lana and Victor. Harold Miller",1
Staff was very friendly and accommodating . We would stay again,1
"I arrived very late and checked in quickly thanks to the gentleman at the front desk. He was very helpful as I had to move some boxes that needed to remain at ambient temperature into my room. Te room was perfect. It was very clean and quite roomy. The bathroom, as others have mentioned, may be on the small side... More",1

The room was dirty and very small. The air conditioner was very loud. There wasn't even a hair dryer in the room.,1
"I was very pleased with this hotel. it was clean and near the airport which is where me and my husband for a flight our of Ft. Lauderdale the next morning. The front desk was helpful. Parking was very easy. And it was not far from the main attraction, Ft Lauderdale Beach. We would definitely stay again :)",1
"Good accessible location. Very comfortable beds. Good breakfast offering. Verrrrrry accommodating staff. Good exercise and technology facilities. Close proximity to PIE airport. All positive on any criteria that I use to evaluate a hotel, particularly including price. Also close to some excellent golf courses.",1
"Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel. Will never stay here again. next time I'll pay more money to stay in a better hotel.",0
"I grew up in Nashua not far from the Crowne Plaza, and finally decided to stay here for the first time in a recent visit home.

"The only good feature about the room was the price. Although clean for the most part it was listed as non-smoking but it was clear the room had been smoked in. Maintenance was very poor. The toilet tank cover was missing and the seat would not stay up. The coffee service in the room had not bee replaced in ages. There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in. The building is old and really needs to be renovated.",1
Was visiting with family in the area. This hotel is convenient to restaurants and museums.,1

Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure...,0

"unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less",0
"Everything was great... Location, room, pool, staff... Highly recommended",1
"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
It's nice and clean you know pretty simple got a good pool for kids and a nice playground the bathrooms nice and it's a great location there are clearly obviously better places to stay but there are also a lot worse and if all your doing is sleeping there it's great because you get free Noah's ark tickets for everyone...

Good: Great location just off The Strip down from The Flamingo easy walking distance to main attractions.,1
"The breakfast each morning was really quite good. A lot of food and a lot of choices - not just carbs. Also, the shuttle that takes your from the hotel to anywhere within 3 miles was extremely valuable. We got to see DC and paid much less than average per night because the shuttle allowed us to go to the Metro every day, We also used the shuttle to go to restaurants for dinner, pick up a rental car for one day, and even church on Sunday",1
Bad: The breakfast was just some muffins and warm coffee. I guess there is no restaurant in the hotel. Good: The staff was great. The room was comfortable. The rates were very reasonable.,1
Very clean modern hotel with well appointed rooms. The front desk clerk Andrea was very helpful extremely polite. Electronic check in very easy to use saves a load of time. Would stay at this hotel again.,1
Staff was great. Room was fairly clean only we would not sit on the sofa...many stains on cushions. When checking room before we left and found a pizza box in refrigerator that we did not put in there. Will do in a pinch,1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient to airport, great staff, lovely decor.",1
"From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing",1
The staff and hotel were great. I would stay here again.,1
Decent hotel. Not dirty. Simple. Good part of strip.,1
"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street.",1
Hotel is nice. Well it's ok. Staff is nice but the construction is 24/7. It's 3:40am ant the cement trucks (3) are working non stop so you hear the diesel running and the back up beeping non stop. I understand there building condos so fault on the hotel but no sleep. Call before you book make sure the construction is... More,0
"The staff was great, very helpful and friendly. I wish we stayed longer but we were only there for a night before a cruise. The view was good looking out over the canal but I wish I had asked for a higher room for the view. The room was clean and to our expectations. The continental breakfast was good thanks to fresh make your own waffles. The staff is really what made this hotel great",1
We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.,1
"We had an absolutely delightful stay at the charming 1906 Lodge. It's hard to know where to begin describing all the positive aspects of staying there! Our room, The Plunge, was spacious and clean. Breakfast in the morning was a culinary treat. A cold buffet and hot entre were both available. We made use of the cruiser bikes and loved... More",1
Very clean and nice hotel. Good breakfast and very quite.,1
An excellent value given the area. Very courteous and professional staff. We were astounded by the continental breakfast: complete w/chef! :) We enjoyed the since of security with the hotel's parking garage. Let's not forget the free drinks. ) A+++ would definitely stay again.,1
"First, the bad -- pretty-much everything in the immediate area is shut down, other than the truck stop across the Interstate.

I didn't detect any of the signs of sketchy activity in the... More",1
I really find Excellent Motel in Grand Island ...Room is clean and very comfortable. Front end executive is very friendly in nature and I Also enjoy nice breakfast.. Excellent Customer service must be appreciated Regards Ash T,1
"Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed.",1
I went here with friends from work and we had a good tome. They have a small bar area but was good enough for the ten of us. Only drawback was the slow food service as it took over an hour for chicken tenders. Probably would go to a different place next time.,1
"Room was quiet. Pool and hot tub available, which was a nice perk.",1
"I was very happy. We needed dinner and a quick night's sleep. The area was great and we had many choices for food. Kind of odd there are no glasses in the room, just two foam coffee cups.",1
This hotel is a great place to stay. We were passing through town and needed to board our friends horses at a nearby stable.

"This hotel on the outskirts of Napa Valley provided an excellent base to tour this area. The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests. They provided us with a lot of options for our stay and were so friendly and informative. We would recommend this hotel purely on the standard of the reception staff.Dear 185robynp,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so pleased you enjoyed our stay and our staff was able to help you with your plans around the valley. We hope to see you again soon. Cheers, Genafer",1
"Looking out over the ocean from your balcony window trumps (almost) any negatives. The rooms are showing their age but are maintained as well as can be expected. If you walk outside the hotel, at night, expect to meet some fairly odd/unusual people. ...Oh and there's a USN base nearby and F-18's scream overhead every 5 mins. lol",1
"For an economy price we were not expecting much. The king room had a large built in cabinet section with lots of drawers and storage to unpack and be comfortable. There is a small fridge and a microwave in the room. The included breakfast was not fancy but more than adequate. They had cereal, bagels, muffins, and the like. They... More",1
"Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room.",1
Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!,1

Bad: Cockroach inside the microwave! Pretty disgusting!!. Good: Loved the cozy suite! Full size refrigerator!,1
"I was very excited about the occasion - our short honeymoon (longer one to follow on our first anniversary) but was disappointed by one thing...the bathroom in the DoubleTree was so small that you had to actually come into the room and move over to the side JUST to close the door. Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!",1
"There was one issue after the other. We noticed immediately upon entering our room that there was no toilet seat. Traveling with 3 females need toilet seat. Went to front desk to be told their were no other rooms available. A few hours later a toilet seat was brought to the room, at which time we discovered it didn't... More",0

Bad: There was vomit in the elevator and I had to tell the front staff to get someone to clean it up. Good: The room was very spacious and decorated nicely.,1
Pubic hair laid on tub next to shampoo bottles all week. When staying all week room only gets cleaned twice a week. I have been on the road for 25 yrs never had my room cleaned only twice a week. Cob webs on ceiling. Didn't pay 40 a night either I would have expected this at that price.,0

"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay.",1

"Our experience at the Homewood Suite was very good. The hotel was very clean. The room we had was very spacious, it accommodated 4 adults 2 children and a puppy. We are very very happy in our choice to go with the Homewood Suite .. Our next trip to Virginia we will stay at the Homewood Suite.",1
Bad: View from room over car park. Good: Great location just off the main strip near Caesars Palace. Room comfortable and staff helpful. Allowed us to have a late check out at no extra cost.,1

"Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
We got some needed clothes shopping done and then had dinner and drinks at El Gaucho. What a wonderful hotel and connected restaurant experience. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys first class service and wonderful food.,1
This hotel is very dated. Rooms were clean enough though. The parking is limited. Wifi was sketchy. Beds and pillows however were wonderful! I would probably not stay again though. Not much around the hotel but we had supper at the Red Coach Inn which was just around the corner. Meal was great.,1
"The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts.",0
"The google/website description is very misleading. It is NOT a BB and the term in-room continental breakfast is a joke.

"We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren. I didn't even realize all the other perks of this hotel for kids. Inside pool, inside playground, inside game room and mini golf. I would totally stay here again for kids it was great.",1
"Overall our stay was very nice, the room was clean and housekeeping was great about providing new towels/sheets/paper etc...

"The main features of this property are its close proximity to the beach and comparatively low price. The rooms are small and a tad cramped, and feel a little damp and musty, even with the (old) AC units running all day. But the beds and facilities were OK, the staff were all very courteous and helpful, and there was a reasonable hot breakfast on the premises. It was good for three nights, but we wouldn't want to have stayed longer.",1

"Friends had told us that this resort was worth visiting, so we booked a five day visit in early March, 2016 and weren't disappointed.

Three restaurants to choose from at hotel (plus to go service if want a snack or light breakfast) and one... More",1
"Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant.",1
"This is a great Hampton. The lobby is huge, and there's more than enough room to spread out for breakfast.

I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island.

I booked a non smoking and at check in we were told that if there is any smoking in the room it is a $200 charge. As soon as we walked into the room you could smell the smoke from someone prior. I alerted the front desk and was offered to have someone spray the room. what good does that do.,1

It's also close to a few restaurants and a corner store.Overall, I think it was a good hotel.",1
Good: Great location and can't beat the happy hour on the 6th floor,1
The staff was super friendly. 5 stars for the young gentleman who checked us in. The physical property is seriously in need of repair. The breakfast area was fairly dirty - trash cans and cabinets covered in residue. Ramada needs to invest some in taking care of the property. Give the wonderful employees something to be proud of.,0
Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa.,1
Bad: Breakfast could have been better. Who likes fake eggs and turkey sausage A bit nasty! We were on third floor when we needed 2- 1st floor rooms. There were a lot of empty 1st floor rooms. A lot of stairs with a lot of luggage and 1 grandma who has leg problems. Good: Beds were great. Very comfortable. Hotel was very clean. Staff was very helpful. Room cleaners did a great job! We were in rooms 339 and 340 for a week. Never saw any bugs! Plenty of towels!,1
The staff was very friendly. Facility was excellent for cleanliness and comfort. Beautiful pool and lounge area. This is a great facility for families or couples! Full hot breakfast that was fresh and yummy even crispy bacon and lots of fresh fruit. The room was spacious with an exceptionally comfortable bed. We would definitely stay here again.,1

Our family had an awesome experience here! Just incredibly clean and up to date suite. Loved the kitchenette. Very quiet and safe. Comfortable beds and a polite staff. Very affordable. Will come again!!,1
The hotel was decent but the room did not seem cleaned thoroughly. There was hair from a previous guest in the shower which I did not notice until I went to shower in the morning. The bed comforter seemed a little dirty as well. The bar closes at 10pm which seemed a little early. The staff was very friendly.,1

Due to the extreme volume of people checking in at the front desk upon my arrival, I was given a key to a room that was already occupied. The front desk staff apologized for their error and corrected the issue promptly. The rest of the stay was comfortable, quiet, and relaxing.",1
"Just a normal hotel room. A nice place to spend a night and take a shower. No whistles and bells. We stayed here on our way to Plymouth, MA. It was not a far ride. There was a free breakfast, but we did not stay to enjoy it.",1
"The staff at Westfield Best Western was very helpful, courteous and accommodating. I stop here whenever I'm in the Westfield, NJ area.

The staff go out of there way to accommodate. Kudos to the... More",1
"This was our first stay in a Drury property. After check in, we requested to switch rooms, as we were on the first floor, which was a bit noisy.

Excellent accommodations. Clean spacious rooms and nice amenities. I am in Chapel Hill regularly and will definitely be returning. The staff was great. Even gave me a tip for a nice Thai restaurant-Bangkok 54- across the way. Excellent hot breakfast too!,1
We decided to try Viceroy Santa Monica after staying at Viceroy Abu Dhabi and enjoying it so much. The hotel is set a street or two back from the beach which was fine but we had an ocean view room which made up for it. There may be some traffic noise if you're staying on the lower floors but we...

"This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting.",1
"Good location. Close to highway. Close to shopping and lots of nice restaurants on 58. Easy drive to zoo, Nauticus, USS Wisconsin, Botanical Gardens, Aquarium. Save money and purchase savings pass that gets you into 4 major attractions. About 60 mins to Williamsburg. Hotel is clean, free breakfast with good selections and changes every couple of days.",1

"This hotel is exceptionally priced for what it offers (e.g. complimentary breakfast, well equiped fitness center, wireless internet), but the price is due to its terrible location and accessibility. Very friendly staff too, but getting there safely is the challenge.",1
My two night stay in Denver started out at a real low point. I found myself next door to a constantly barking dog and a constantly chirping bird. Who travels with a bird The people in Room 410.

"Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else.",0
"Excellent accommodations, excellent staff, super super breakfast in the morning, with everything you can imagine. Stay at this hotel you will be happy! Easy access to the highway, easy access to many venues. Very clean, the staff was very welcoming when I arrived!",1
This is a great location for turning in your rental car.,1
Bad: Better breakfast selection. Nothing available for us since we are on a low carb diet like eggs or sausage/bacon. Good: Location to theatre.,1

housekeeping staff said some very rude ugly words when we weren't ready to check out at 8:50 am !!! check out time is supposed to be at 11 am. everything else was awesome and everyone else was also awesome !,1
"There is nothing I can say about this place. Stuck here for a convention. Poor service, Poor food quality. Bathrooms are at least 15-20 years old. Water issues. Maid service not even close to daily. Entire property is dirty. I would not stay here again if it were free",0
"Not sure who to blame. Expedia, says something about surcharge in one place, another place says nothing. Real pain to realize you got a good room rate, then need to fork out an extra 50 for parking. Of course no one takes responsibility. To their credit, the front desk did offer 35, since it was 5 days. 50 is up to 14 days. Expedia couldn't do anything.",1

Good food and drinks available poolside and at Duke's restaurant. Beautiful trails to walk or run on along the beach. Great staff.",1

"Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again.",1
Excellent location - clean hotel - safe - friendly and helpful staff. We ve stayed twice this year - short driving distance to Disney parks. Great for family travel - breakfast and wifi included. Will stay again,1

"This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again. When we told them we were unhappy with a room with a double bed, we were told you wont be able to do anything since you didn't go through them directly (since we booked through hotels.com)",0
"We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast.",0
The staff were very cautious and helpful. I really liked the fresh omelet / eggs option with the breakfast. The restraint is convenient and good with a great view of the lake. Internet worked with no issue and I cannot say that in some of my stays.,1
I was a bit worried after seeing bad comments .well I have just had 14 nights here bedding and towels where excellent and clean .only used lift 3 times has the stairs seem to quicker .The staff where excellent and polite.We ate our breakfast there and could not fault there was excellent choice even sausage and egg what more could...

We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the elevator was broke for 2 days of our stay but glad we were only on the 4th floor. The free shuttle to the metro was awesome and saved us so much in parking and the hassle of DC traffic. The room was clean and housekeeping provided our needs in necessities.,1

"Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!",0
"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

"Needed a good value hotel. This turned out to be perfect. Heavily booked, but it did not affect customer service from the employees I had contact with.",1
Bad: The water wasn't super hot the first day (maybe it was time of day) and there was no way to adjust the temperature of the room. Good: The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were quaint but classy. Loved the balcony. The in-room wine selection was pretty neat. I'll definitely come back to experience more of what they have to offer.,1
"Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door.",1

"For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you.",1

My husband and I attended the Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg. This was the second time we stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean and attractively decorated. The staff are friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the restaurant and lounge for breakfast and dinner. The staff here were also friendly. Both meals were reasonable in price.,1

"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly.",1
"Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good.",1
"This place is most likely the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Very clean rooms, they smell good and feel like home. You don't feel like you're staying at a hotel at all.

Rooms in the first floor are noisy and you can hear the music of the restaurant below. A gym would be a very nice to have. Good: The rooftop pool was so nice and with a beautiful view to the sea. Rooms are absolutely cosy. The restaurant is nice furnished and serves excellent food. Excellent location.",1
Wonderful woman at front desk and man working as general maintenance.,1
The first time we went on vacation here we walked into our room and just started laughing. You get what you pay for. And here you are paying for location! What amazing views.

"I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!",1
Enjoyed my time w my family ... The carpets are aging and could use replacement. The pool was enjoyable and loved by all.,1
Friendly desk personnel. Friendly staff. Free shuttle service from the hotel to the metro station. Breakfast arrangements were comfortable. My room had an excellent view. I highly recommend this hotel.,1
"When this hotel first opened I adored it. I visited regularly and it became the benchmark of what a brilliant hotel should be.

"My girlfriend and I were stayed one night here and loved the location . All of the shops and restaurants are walkable from this hotel and the staff was great. Breakfast is also included which is an added bonus. Parking is the only negative , which is 20 on site and 5 two blocks away.",1
"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.",0
"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem.",1
Rooms were good size. Breakfast was good. Didn't appreciate the kids running in the halls all night. I had a sick child and had to call to complain. Also had a strong smell in the hallway of weed. Pool floor needs to be redone. Pieces were floating in the pool.,1
We always love staying at this hotel. The rooms are very comfy and it is conveniently located downtown in the vicinity of great local restaurants. The only downside to our last two visits has been not being able to take advantage of the Make Sunday's Better late check-out. If this hotel cannot accommodate late Sunday checkouts then that should be... More,1

"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!",1
"First off, the bed was super comfortable. But... Room cleanliness could be better, linens stained, breakfast worse than most, on the very end of strip bordering sketchy neighbors. Lots of other choices in area.",1
Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again.,1
"This hotel is close to the aiport whh is the main reason of our choice.the service is very good, people are friendly and helpful Room and bathroom are very cleant and comfortable The only problem : the poor qualty of the Internet connection in our room Shuttle from ant to the airport : perfectly on time",1
"Hotel was clean, staff was friendly! Would definitely stay here again. We were traveling with three kids, and the pool was nice to play in and the hot tub was nice to relax in. Used laundry facilities as well, and they were clean and inexpensive. Hotel was quiet and centrally located to the attractions we were there to see. Great... More",1
"I'm a local and have been coming since the resort was built, but on our visit last weekend things dove to a new low. Never mind that we spent over 70 so that two kids could play for less than 2 hours, and we could attend to them (10.50 per person to just watch your kids). First, we had to... More",0
"Very helpful and friendly staff, overall a good stay with just a few hickups. Breakfast had a nice variety and overall good. The room was nice and clean except for a large bug that I disposed of. Location was on a dead end street that was odd to get too but OK once you had it figured out.",1
Bad: Rude Staff.,0
I have stayed at the Frederick several times over the years. The proprietor is always very accommodating to any of my requests. Love the ambiance. This place has character and is far superior to any modern day hotel.,1
"Location is awesome and walking distance from a lot of great bars, restaurants and a mall. Besides that the quality of the hotel didn't really live up its price-level. Staff was friendly but poorly trained. Just little things like an employee hijacking an elevator down to parking as I was trying to go up and another one at the front... More",1
"Hotel staff was very friendly and knowledge. The staff greets you as you walk by them in the hall. Clean rooms, hotel was very quiet. The hotel lobby is 100 feet away from a Denny's restaurant, which was really convenient. The waterpark passes to Chula Vista were nice, but beware, it is a 15-20 minute drive to Chula Vista. I...

The stay was pleasant but some of the staff did not seem to be knowledgable about the hotel's policies and billing. Only one person was really helpful.,1
"Hole in shower, broken toilet seat. Facility is worn and needs to be updated.",0
"I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund.",0
"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!",1
"The hotel is older but it is clean and the staff were very friendly. We arrived late after travelling for many hours and they were friendly and quick to get us into a room. They kept the pool open an extra half hour so our daughter could swim, which was a huge bonus to an 11 year old.",1
"I have always had a river view room. Was told by the gentleman checking me in that wasn't true. He then said he would give me a river view room for an upgrade fee of 15.00 a day. Told him NO. I was given a room near the parking lot, no amenities at all. No frig (first time that has... More",1
Me and my 13 yr. old daughter loved the hotel. The staff was great and very freindly.... the were not totally booked and they gave us a cool room overlooking the pool. They also allowed us a later than usual checkout... never know until you ask. We also enjoyed the cute workout room and the excellent breakfast buffet.Thanks Mills House for making my daughters spring break a success!!!,1
"We arrived for check in at 4:00 pm and was welcomed and we given a tour of the lodge and our room and also showing us the dining room and explaining that wine would be available on Friday evening in the Great room where we met a couple from England and a couple from Pittsburgh, very interesting talks. There was... More",1

I came to this lovely motel from New York and had requested a bonfire and the manager had set it up very beautifully for my family and I. We sat around it and told stories and made s'mores. This bonfire had given us the opportunity to spend quality time with my loved ones. The rooms were nice and clean and... More,1
"We stayed here with family for a long pre-Christmas weekend in Nashville. Located in fairly close proximity of Opryland, the Opryland Mills outlet mall, and the Gaylord Opryland Convention Center, as well as close to a slew of restaurants, it is a convenient location and is a fairly easy area to navigate. It also can be challenging due to traffic,... More",1
Loved it - I had not stayed in one of these before. I'll definitely use this hotel again.,1

Hotel was really nice. Loved the free parking and breakfast. Awesome location since it is within walking distance to the arch and stadium. Would stay again. Nice pool area. Front desk very helpful. They offered a veterans disxount.,1
"This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower.",0

Nadia is the best!!!!,1
Worst place ever for family room was smelly and office staff not helpful,0
friendly staff everything clean help on surroundings and attractions Nice to have a restaurant next door. Hotel breakfast was good and I even took a banana for the road Hopefully the outdoor pool will open. Whole weekend was rain!,1
Great customer service,1
Everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. They had no problem giving us a late checkout when we needed it. Overall great experience.,1
"Although my stay was just a quick overnight, I was impressed by the looks and convenient location of this hotel.",1
"Room wasn't ready in time. hotel were able to rent a car, but they were suppose to call let us know when it would be ready, we ended up calling.

"For a weekend getaway this was a bit of a let down. I would recommend for a business traveler which it seemed geared toward, but for a fun couples weekend in the gas lamp it didn't provide any of the boutiquey extras I've come to expect. The room was small and very generic. The bathroom in particular, the tub was... More",1
My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was our first time visiting NOLA. Since it was our first time visiting and we were celebrating a special occasion we booked a king suite with a balcony. The extra price tag was worth it. The balcony was amazing- we overlooked...

Bad: Hotel tried to charge extra for change in tax. Had a difficult time during check in because of this factor. Room was very small for three people to stay in. Good: Hotel was clean and close to everything in south beach.,1
"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend.",1
Bad: Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic. Good: The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom.,1
"Bad: Was a bit pricey, but may be that was the season and the timing (March 17, it was a music festival at Miami Beach). Good: Very clean and stylish. Very helpful staff.",1
"This hotel's people are friendly and helpful, patient with questions, and easy to deal with. The public areas are well-kept and clean. There was nice selection in the complimentary breakfast. The fitness center, while not large, was well-equipped vs. similar size hotels. I will stay there again the next time I am in the area.",1
"This was our second stay at a Drury Hotel and we were impressed once again! The rooms were clean and fair sized, check in was easy and quick. The free drinks and evening snack are such a great feature and you could honestly make a meal of it. The pool is close to the food/beverage area so it is convenient... More",1
I can't give this property enough praise. We stayed here quite unexpectedly because of a spring snowstorm that closed Raton Pass in the afternoon. We had to double back to Raton and began frantically calling hotels when it because apparent that we were not going to be able to make it home that night. We were among the lucky travelers... More,1
"Great stay, quiet, and affordable. West Texas is famous for its hospitality and this place contributes mightily to that reputation. I especially liked the outdoor fire pit and sitting areas. I look forward to coming back.",1
"Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient.",1
Basic needs met late arrival OK. Great price!,1
"Comfortable beds, nice pool and hot tub. Computer room very handy since I didn't bring a laptop or iphone. Good fitness center. Great bonus was a coupon for a free full breakfast at next door's Denny's.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay!",1

"I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area.",1
There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M.,0
"This hotel is perfect for being close to everything, but that is all it is perfect for. We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough. I could see the lights... More",0
"This is an old style motel with external doors that has had the rooms redone. They are improved with the newer style bedding, but the room we had was not well cleaned, even found crackers along the baseboard of the wall. The walkways are mostly outside and the concrete is cracked and in poor condition. The breakfast buffet was served... More",0
"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Great location with easy on and off of the freeway in any direction. Hot breakfast was very good. Rooms a little run down but satisfactory. Price was very reasonable for the location and the pool was well maintained. Staff polite and helpful. I travel to this area a couple of times a year and this was my first time staying in this hotel, I will utilize this hotel next time.",1
My stay was wonderful other than I was double charged for my room so we had to fix that 1 day in but it all got straightened out and I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling .. the management is extremely nice and will help with anything u need ...,1
"Check-in was a breeze, room was great and we loved the pillows. Close to the aiport and a good rate per night.",1
I've been staying here for many years when I take in the Des Moines Operas at Simpson College in Indianola. This is very convenient to the campus and town in general. Reasonably priced. I usually stay 3 nights. Very convenient to Des Moines also.,1
Always delightful. Professional and convenient,1
Staff very helpful at check inn. Excellent recommendation for eating places. Will stay again.,1
"Located in good proximity to Metro station and lots of eateries. Hotel has seen some wear and tear, but was a good value for us. Heat in our room wasn't working and that was repaired right away. Sadly, we never did get a clock/alarm that worked.",1
"This hotel was wonderful. I stayed with friends and we had a great nights rest which we all really needed. It was the most spacious and beautiful hotel room that I think I have ever had. It was clean (actually the room smelled wonderful, as did the towels!) The bathroom was excellent. So many hotel rooms have poor lighting nowadays... More",1
"Nice clean hotel, undergoing some renovations. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was good , many choices such as waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage and gravy as well as yogurt and hot food was hot. They had great recommendations for local restaurants, Our favorite was the Monkey Town Brewery.",1
"One night stay, just needed a place to sleep and we have cat. Overall...very positive experience for price. One negative, we had to clean under bed (not pretty) to make sure our cat had a clean environment.",1
"While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable.",0
We always try and stay at Hampton Inn . This is our first stay at this one and it is the best yet. Clean. No smoking. We had 4 rooms and every one was really nice with great beds and linens. Staff was awesome. ..every single person . Will absolutely stay here again.,1
"The stay was highly satisfactory. We were very impressed with Dan, who was managing the desk. There seemed to be some confusion about the category of room (we were allotted a room meant for handicapped person) but Dan straightened it out within a minute. He was also helpful with neighborhood information. Will stay there if we visit Newport again.",1
"Location is good if you are going to the Disney Resorts.Good price. Repairs are needed though. We had some issues with toilet running, tub faucet dripping, bolt lock broken and missing. Sheets and towels were clean. Microwave and little fridge in room with 2 queen beds. I would try it again.",1
We had a wonderful stay here. It was very clean and the staff was super friendly. We had some minor housing/maintenance issues but over all it was well worth the price. I think we ran to wal-mart at least 10 times. Lots of stores and eateries in the area. I will stay again.,1
This is your basic nice clean hotel. We have stayed here twice due to work in the area and needed a safe secure place to park our work vehicle. The price usually fits our budget and the staff have always been pleasant. Rooms are nice and the location is within walking distance to the beach and lots of dining. We... More,1
"FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience.",1
I went here over 20 years ago when I was a kid for a family reunion and I was pleased to see it look exactly like it did then. Of course it was updated and very clean. The workers were always maintaining the resort. I love how you have 3 different pool areas. The water inside was a little too... More,1

"I had a great sleep. Great location, near Disney. Plenty of restaurants near by. The outlets and any other shopping were minutes away. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was ok. Wish it had more breakfast options for a diabetic, but overall a surprising and wonderful stay.",1
Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub. I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into/ out of pool. Staff was pleasant and professional.,1
Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great! Can't wait to come back!,1
We stayed for 3 nights and had a room with a great view of the strip on the 25th floor. Rooms are lovely with a tablet to control all functions. Everything is pricey here but that's to be expected from the strip!,1
Best vacation ever!!!,1
"This was a trip playing tourist over New Years 2014/2015. I stayed in a Club Level room 2 floors down from the top. The room was very clean, very well appointed, albeit not very large.

My stay was great. The staff was friendly and welcoming and I even got a gift bag which made it a plus! I would recommend to anyone.,1
"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean",1
The staff was very friendly and courteous. Sleeping was difficult due to nearby highway and hvac unit noise. TV and Internet worked well. The plaster work on the ceiling was unsightly and needs repair. Ceiling lamp had dead bugs. Breakfast was very good.,1
"Lobby is clean and fresh smelling as is elevator. Room was mostly clean, but not clean smelling.

The price for mid... More",0
"I visited my old neighborhood for a few days. The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in. Hotel personnel called a cab twice, with a rapid response. The computer in the business center wasn't working, so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk.",1
Staff were friendly. The suite was of good size and very practically arranged. The shuttle to and from the metro worked very reliably (about every 10 to 15 minutes).,1
"Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge",1
"Makeover was done well and not over the top. Dinner was good. Had the risotto. The chef has a mushroom obsession, so be forewarned. Breakfast was outstanding. Healthy and tasty choices and a warm, cheery staff. Personally, I would have preferred a firmer mattress, but still slept very well.",1
"This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. The breakfast bar impressed us with the variety of options available. Definitely recommend this hotel!",1
"The staff at Home 2 Suites is terrific! As a frequent business guest, they remember you by name and always create a welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are well laid out and perfect for the business traveler.",1
"Staff is outstanding! Food at breakfast was always fresh and hot. Staff very helpful for info on local delivery takeout. Only complaint is room lighting. Bathroom especially, trouble applying makeup and shaving.",1
"If Justin Bieber and then-Bruce Jenner stays here, you know it has to be good. This Boutique hotel near downtown, may be small, but it offers friendly attentive service, wonderful facilities, delectable food (from a nearby in my view: 5 rated restaurant) and a good location.",1
I enjoyed the convenience of the location and having the Whole Foods store within walking distance was a plus.,1
Dated... The room,1
The manager and the other people who worked at Ramada Flagstaff were very nice and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable and they have a great deal from Papa John's which came in very handy since we were exhausted from a long trip and didn't want to go out for dinner.

"The Armstrong is a hotel with a lot of character, perfectly situated in Ft. Collins to allow easy access to the dining and shopping areas of town.

"I had zero cell reception with my carrier T-Mobile. Not the hotel's fault. But because of that, I needed regular Wi-Fi reception. This hotel, unfortunately, had awful wifi. I was on the first floot, at the end of the hallway. They need more or better...MoreWe wanted to take a second and thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. You are correct that T-Mobile has very poor if any reception in our area. We are aware of the poor internet reception BUT we have great news!...More",0
"Great price for the area. Dated room, but clean. Great wifi, ice machine very full. The continental breakfast consisted of donuts and toast with tang and coffee, but at least it's something. Located about 5 minutes from downtown. Friendly staff. I'd stay again!",1
"One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.",1
"My experience was good, the staff was helpful, professional, and happy to help. The hotel is old though, the hotel has done a nice job on keeping it up but the rooms really show their age.",1
Bad: Old building- old room. Good: Staff- breakfast,1
very happy with convenience of hotel and the shuttle provided to and from the airport. Slamming doors and yelling kids at 5 am was sleep disturbing but the only problem. Great German restaurant down the street,1
"Its far from DC. but hotel is good. Sorrounding also is good, lots of eating places nearby. Room was big and worth its price. But AC was not too cool. Hotel should provide a fridge in the room. My kid picked up a wafer which she put it back. But I find they charged me for that from my credit card statement. They did not even confirm from me. I had to lodge a complaint and they reverted back the amount.",1
Good: It was big enough for our family. We could all relax and enjoy ourselves.,1

"We absolutely loved our stay in Aria Hotel. We were lucky enough to get a room on the 54th floor and although we weren't facing the strip, the view is still beyond amazing. Location is perfect and couldn't recommend enough.",1
We enjoyed staying at The London. Service was excellent. Our room was large and beautiful with a sweet balcony that was actually usable. The buffer breakfast was very nice. We thought it exceeded the cost in every way. We will definitely return.,1
"the hotel boasts one of the most comfortable beds I have had the pleasure of sleeping on. Also, a well appointed room all around.",1
Another pleasant stay at Aria. Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view. Our rooms were on the 4th floor and all we could see was a/c equipment. Brick oven pizza was delicious and buffet filing.,1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Rooms were big and very clean, the smell of the room was awesome. The staff are very friendly and the location is perfect",1
"Clean, quiet hotel with good breakfast included in the price",1
Good: We were made to feel very welcome nothing was to much trouble the staff are very good.,1
Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else.,0
Bad: Check-in process as staff was deceptive and misleading as to when we could check-in. Others around us were equally upset with the dishonesty. Good: Great price through Booking.com. Room was clean and bed comfortable.,1
I need quality rest during the day because I work at night and being tired is not an option in my line of work. The hotel staff make sure there are no issues with noise and the rooms are very clean and comfortable,1
"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com.",1
"Loved the location, service and staff. The rooms were EXTREMELY small. We upgraded to a Deluxe Queen room and was surprised by how tiny that room was. We could not imagine the petite rooms. The staff was accommodating and moved us to a handicapped King room which had much for space for nights 2 3. The hotel is old,... More",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Everything,1
The room was to hot and no remedy was offered and the service at breakfast was inadequate. At 4 a cup I expect my coffee refilled without having to chase down a waiter. (We were the second customer in the restaurant that morning.) The same is true of water refills.,0
"I've stayed at several hotels in the area, but this is favorite. It is clean, spacious, comfy, and close to th casino. But their greatest asset is the woman checking you in. I wish I could remember her name. Super nice and friendly and helpful. I'm so glad I found this place. Note: website was showing sold out but we... More",1
"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!",1
"We stayed at the hotel while visiting the USF campus. The double queen executive suite was very spacious and clean. All of the rooms face inward to the pool/ courtyard area, which was very nice. The hotel restaurant, Burger Theory, had some of the best burgers we have eaten in a long time, with very pleasant staff. The hotel offered... More",1
"I stayed for one night with a couple friends. We were in town for a concert. The hotel was clean, conveniently located, nice, and a good value. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly.",1
"Great staff, nice facilities, clean rooms, great service and good breakfast. However, running toilets in three different rooms based on conversation with other guests. Creates noise and wastes water. Staff seemed eager to get it taken care of though.",1
"This Drury is AWESOME! The staff is super friendly and attentive. Could not ask for more in terms of the food, breakfast and the 5:30 Kickback (especially the mac and cheese, mmmmm). Location is convenient to restaurants (several within walking distance) and shopping. I have to go to the local hospital for work and the Drury is within 5 miles... More",1

The same room also provide free coffee, soda, water, snacks, and concierge services. There is a security person that checks everyone's room key to... More",1
"Bad: The only disadvantage is lack of elevator, however it's quite common in Ar Deco hotels. However you could ask for ground floor room. Good: I loved staying there. The hotel located between 4th and 3d streets. It's quiet part of seashore, there was much less noise than at Ocean drive. 5-7 min to the beach. Good wi-fi. Reasoable breakfast with cereals and cookies.",1
"The weather was horrible for our weekend in Denver, but the hotel made a nice difference. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean. I would especially like to thank Kerry at the front desk for working so hard to make sure everything was right!",1
one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Could not wait to leave in the mornings. As it was memorial weekend the pickings were very slim.,0
"Every time we come here, we always enjoy a nice comfortable meal and our server, Bobbie, who always makes great recommendations. Burgers, sandwiches, fish and salads. Whatever they do, it's always good. We are regulars!",1
"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location.",1
"We were warmly greeted with leis upon arrival at the resort. Most nights the driveway is lined with tiki torches, and there are two gorgeous ponds in front of the hotel with a waterfall, black swans and ducks. The hotel itself resembles a palace with marble and exotic plants everywhere. One of the first things you see from the lobby... More",1
"Fun decor in lobby and in rooms. Nice ammenities. Bed was extremely comforable, one of the best nights sleep ever!",1
"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it.",0
Good: I was always asked meaningful questions and was never hassled and never waited for a taxi. The service was great and quick and the room was beautiful plus I got exactly what I requested.,1
Front counter friendly but the bed was very uncomfortable and the tub was dirty and drained slow.,0
"Our go-to place when visiting family in UT. We've stayed at several hotels in Salina within a mile of I-70, and this is the best value. Consistently great service, and an indoor pool with heated jacuzzi that we always enjoy. There are plenty of choices with the complimentary Breakfast. You can't beat what you get for 50.",1
"My wife and I love visiting LA, and just got back from a trip we took with friends.

The complimentary breakfast was... More",1
"Everything was great from beginning to end! Check out went smoothly, and the staff was friendly! Our room was absolutely amazing! There was a balcony that overlooked the ocean! It was incredible. The beds were comfy and the room was clean. The restaurant downstairs gave hubby and I free Shirley temples! I loved it and wished I could have stayed longer to fully take advantage of the amenities. I will definitely be back!!!!",1
"The three best things about the Saga Motor Hotel: location, location, location. Right on Colorado Boulevard, across the street from Pasadena City College, the Saga can best be described as a 1950s motor lodge. That is, its a place you can sleep in relative comfort, but the decor is sadly in need of updating. The TripAdvisor photo taken in 2011... More",1
"Since my teenage kids all live in Tampa, I usually travel there several times a year to visit, which can get a little costly at times.

In town for the US Open it was a bit noisy the night the Penguins won the cup but it was a comfortable room with quick room service. The only negative was I had waived room service for the first day and the maid service never showed up all week- i had to call to get them to clean.,1
We arrived at the hotel my husband and I. We asked for an upgrade we were told you the hostile receptionist there were none which I found hard to believe. The room was mediocre but very dusty and I wouldn't have expected to see that. We were charged resort tax but didn't use the pool or gym. One night we... More,1
Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd. Beds were especially comfortable. Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone,1
The pillows were too small and not comfortable. The staff was wonderful. The complimentary breakfast was very good.,1
I booked 28 rooms at the Palo Duro Canyon Inn and Suites. I booked with the Manager and he was very helpful. The hotel is pretty from the outside and the inside is very nice. It was a good choice.

We always enjoy seeing you and your family! Looking forward to welcoming you again!",1
"Good location to get around on foot and see Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, etc. The lobby is beautiful. The staff was friendly. Other reviews have complained about city noise (sirens and such) but it was not a problem in my opinion. You hear them, obviously, because you are in the city, but it's not constant.",1
The Holiday Inn in Butte is a great new addition to the City. It's beautiful and brand new. The hotel is right off of the interestate and is close to nearly everything in town.

Wonderful staff and quality accommodations. Great location to Ft. Benning and quiet comfortable rooms. Have stayed in this property several times and always have the same consistent experience. The staff is very accommodating and always cheerful. Breakfast is limited but is certainly enough to get the morning started.,1

"I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house. Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future! Kind regards,Eric Gray",1

Bad: Lavatory very small for a large bathroom.,1
"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. I may be reached at Octavia.margineanstregis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
Nice hotel and walking distance to many food/bars/SAP Pavilion.,1
My family and I were overly pleased with the staff especially housekeeping. Traveling with a 4 and 1 year old can be challenging and the staff assisted with a couple bumps in our trip and made us fell welcomed. Hope to return next year to run the marathon again.,1
Room was not clean and smelled. Hotel culture needs improvement and need better staff training. Management need to be trained in hospitality.,0
Stayed here for 1 night. Friendly check in staff but the hotel needs and overhaul. Hallways are shabby and the room had a damp smell. The photos are misleading. If i was staying longer I would have most likely checked out early and moved elsewhere. The view over the busy main road was the high point with a lovely outlook... More,0

Road work made entry and departure a challenge. Not in the hotel's control.,1
This site was very nice. It's close to the interstate and close to DC. You won't be disappointed.,1
The Mills House is just lovely. The rooms have upgraded bathrooms and wonderful bed linens. Very quiet. The dining room needs some attention when it comes to service and the food is up to the restaurant standards in the area but that is a small complaint.We would go back again.,1
Stayed here back in October and planned a wonderful review. I spoke too soon. Of the four couples who stayed here (in our group) only 1 couple did NOT have extra charges placed on his/her credit card. Each of the extra charges were traced back to this hotel - - - for NON-hotel expenses. Luckily my credit card company knows... More,0

"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More",1
"We stayed here one night while passing through town. The room was very clean, spacious but just a touch too costly at 131 a night. 100 for the family sized room is more realistic. Oh Well. Nothing really bad to say.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.",1
"I was happy to see the hotel was close to my destination. Disappointed, however, that there were spots on the bedspread and my travel companion found a dead bug on her pillow case. I asked her to call the front desk to tell them but she didn't want to. We also had to stop by the office to get a bath mat. I know I didn't pay a lot, but I would rather pay for peace of mind than to experience yuck.",1
Hotel was very clean. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. A lot of nearby shopping centers.,1

"Lovely location on a picturesque bluff overlooking a broad, golden beach, this resort hotel's ample grounds were also attractively landscaped. The rooms were nicely decorated and very comfortable.

Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet.,1
Very clean hotel but staff from the minute checked in just felt like they had better things to do with their time and really would rather be somewhere else. We would ask them questions and they either ignored us or their person conversations were more important. Will not be staying there again.,0
"Very nice hotel - mainly aimed at honeymooners. Our room was upgraded to a suite as we were on out HMoon - lovely services. Only downfall, can't go all-in as it's the USA! Food was rather pricey on site, nothing close by so best to hire a car. Overall, amazing HMoon!",1
"Bad: the hotel was just ok the employees were friendly and helpful but the area is a little rough, had to walk 4 or 5 blocks before you found anything going on other than other hotels. The area outside of the hotel is dirty up and down the streets.",1

"Not the most restful hotel in the world. The air-freshener made a bleeping noise every 82 seconds and the front desk didn't even try to fix it, preferring to let it bleep through the night. Then room-service banged on my door twice even though the do-not-disturb sign was on the door. Wi-Fi bandwidth -- was great, room was clean.",0
This hotel was underwhelming. Even though it is newer construction it had an old feel to it. They put me in the wrong room to begin with. I booked a room with 2 queen beds and a pull out. That is not what I got. I had to wait for the room I booked to be cleaned. When we did... More,0
"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns.

"The hotel was very clean and front desk service was fast and friendly. The room was a bit small with only one chair. The free breakfast was good but the plastic silverware and styrofoam plates was a bit tacky. However, I did get a great rate so I was definitely satisfied and would stay here again when needed.",1

"I booked my trip with the understanding that I would be staying at a Hyatt Regency Hotel. I did not find out until I arrived that the hotel had changed hands as of Dec 1st and under construction.We arrived Christmas day. It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors.",1
We drove 17 hours that day and I just wanted to shower and sleep. I am so glad they open this newer hotel in Deming. Breakfast was pretty good but the rooms were great. We will be back next time we come through NM.,1
"Bathrooms need renovating. Were not on par with rest of room. My shower/tub did not drain, at all, and water was up past my ankles by the time I finished showering. Every staff person I encountered was exceptionally helpful, polite, and friendly. Rooms were a nice size and had nice amenities.",1
"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge",1

"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA.",0
"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"We stayed one night. I peaked into the pool area and it was showing its age, but looked like it would do if you had kids. The public areas were clean...the carpet in the halls was in good shape and well kept and the lobby bathroom was sort of clean. The rooms are spacious and the bed linen and cover... More",1
"This hotel was great and I loved the location! I felt like I was in the middle of all of the action on the strip. We stayed in a corner suite and the views were amazing! the windows are floor to ceiling and offer stunning views of the Vegas strip, even from the bathroom. I would take baths in the... More",1
Good: Comfortable Bed !,1
The one bedroom suite was outstanding. Private roof top patio. Responsive and hospitable staff from the front desk to the housekeepers. Gratis wine and cheese in the lobby before going out for dinner and port upon returning. Breakfast delivered to the room in a picnic basket at precisely the time I requested. I had to depart for the airport at... More,1
"Bad: Not really anything to do with the hotel but we were only in San Fran for a few days and found we spent a lot of time travelling down to the pier for Alcatraz, cycling across the bridge etc. Buses take a long time (so do taxis though) and although walkable (about an hour) if you've only got limited time in the City you might want to think about staying nearer to the Piers or Financial District. Good: Great location for Union Square and surrounding area. Hotel was funky and rooms were HUGE. Great bonus after a long haul flight and when there are two friends sharing.",1
My friends and I stayed at this hotel earlier this month and could not have been happier with our choice! The rooms were nice and very clean. We had a room with two beds overlooking the mountains and canal and it was a good amount of space for the three of us. The location was exactly where we wanted to... More,1

"All I needed was a clean bed and a shower, it suited me fine.",1
"late arrival....spent about 5 min in the room. Dirty towels and bed sheets. Found 2 bugs in the so called bathroom. TV from the 70*s and a carpet where you would prefer to keep you shoes on. Thankfully the clerk gave us our money back, as he could see the bugs himself. When we left again....saw notice from a public... More",0
"Spent my honeymoon here, well one week of it. What a great place. Very much like a condo, they have barbq for you to use The restaurant, The Duke, is really good, but a bit pricey. Rooms are big and well worth the money.",1
"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.",0
Bad: Missed check in by almost 2 hrs. Good: Location decor bar service,1
My family had a very nice stay. super location everything right out the door. Breakfast could not be better and free.very friendly staff all and all a great place to stay.,1

"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!",1
Bad: I was under the impression there was a casino... there is no casino.,1
The shuttle to Bricktown is very convenient. Really good breakfast.,1
"The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in. I have been a Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond member since 2007, and this is the best stay I have ever had with the Hilton properties. This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND.",1
I was pleasantly surprised. Stayed 7 nights. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I wish I had gotten their names to send them a commendation. The unit was clean and well supplied. We had no neighbors or either side so we had lots of privacy. The common areas were clean and well maintained. I know some reviewers have complained about the... More,1
Its an older hotel and the room was darker and smaller than expected. The breakfast provided was very nice and they made upgrades to the bathroom. Overall basic and okay place to stay just no visual thrills or excitement. Located directly across from the airport so it is super convenient for air travel.,1
"The hot breakfast is a good idea but horrible. Plenty of towels, but need to invest in some fabric softener. The sheets were not fresh",1
"To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it. Overall average which is disappointing for this brand. Thank you for sharing your feedback, Domenica.We regret that your experience with us was less than ideal. We're disappointed to hear the service you received wasn't up to par. Providing our guests with exceptional service is something we take seriously. Please know this will be addressed with the appropriate members of our team so we may improve for the future.We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the service we're truly capable of providing.",1
"You get the good and the bad with the Capri. It was clean, casual, excellent mattress, friendly and helpful staff, good location, pet friendly, fenced patio for the dog.

My first time here and I absolutely loved it!! We definitely will be coming back!,1
My wife and I stayed feb 13-14 for our 31st wedding anniversary. Had a very enjoyable stay. Close to everything. Rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. If youre looking for a good place to stay I highly recommend twin islands.,1

"We had a quick overnight stay here while traveling from Atlanta to Boston. At the end of a 12 hour day in the car, this was a great place to pull into! The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"Tom Fulk and Lonnette Neill set the stage for a great stay at this Hampton Inn. We were a group of 53 guests and the stay was perfect. Super clean rooms, great breakfasts and very accomodating staff. Highly recommended!",1
Bad: Nothing!. Good: The hotel staff were very nice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. Its right at the beach and you even get a couple chairs and an umbrella.,1
Worst hotel experience of my lift. We are campers who do not require amenities and state of the art anything. BUT we do expect clean. There was black mold under the window sill in room 204 which was exposed by the peeling wallpaper. Not sure if the hotel owns a vacuum. The bed underskirt was dirty. Lamp broken. Shower rod... More,0

I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!",1

All employees were very helpful and polite,1
"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage.",1
"Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault.",1
"Bad: I was hoping to approve my late departure since my flight was in te evening. Good: Nice staff, helpfull excellent location Soft touches did not experience in many hotels but sure your staff show it",1
"comfortable bed. microwave, fridge. sink area separate area from bathroom. Very clean. Did not have breakfast as it ends at 9:30 and we missed it so can't comment. Not a luxury hotel but quiet and great value for the price of 62. night. Convenient to I75.",1
"We had a wonderful 5 day stay here! We enjoyed everything about this hotel.

"Stay in Howard Johnson Inn is a good deal I can find over the Internet around University of Delaware -- Newark area. However, (1) the breakfirst is too simple, not good. (2) One night there was no hot water. (3) Another night there was no Internet connection. (4) they charge early check-in for some $40, that is not friendly.

Very nice hotel with many conveniences. We selected because they provide a shuttle to the airport and downtown. We were able to stay without having to rent a car.,1
Bad: WiFi was not working sometimes. Breakfast is pretty boring. Good: Nice location and hotel itself. The staff is nice and helpful.,1
Good: Customer service and overall quality of hotel was excellent,1
The hotel was nice for the price the hot breakfast could have been better the food tasted like it was all made in the microwave. Which ot probably was it is just that scrambled eggs made in the microwave do not taste very good.,1
I chose this hotel which is one of the more expensive as I was travelling alone and it advertised two restaurants and close proximity to shopping. Not true! Restaurant was only open for breakfast and the food in the bar was woeful (same food offered for room service). - imagine processed burger cheese on French onion soup and you get... More,1
Great stay very nice,1
Bad: Spa wasn't available. Good: Staff are exceptional and very friendly,1
"Bad: The hotel room did not meet expectations. There was shaved hair in the shower (did not belong to us) and the water did not get hot. It took 10 minutes of running the water to even get to a somewhat comfortable temperature. It was requested for our two rooms to be beside each other and that request was unable to be met. Finally, when my child got sick with the flu, they were unwilling to work with me on the two nights I paid for and lost because she was sick. Good: Location and pool",0

"This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great.",1
We had nice time in Sikeston. We went while my granddaughters was on spring break. They offer breakfast and they have something for dinner too(didn't go to that). Our room was clean and quiet. I would stay again.,1
excellant breakfast - great cookies in the afternoon-friendly staff and very clean Only compliant was that other guests were banging their doors very early in the morning and staff scraping sidewalk with shovel very early,1
"This year we decided to rent a 4-bedroom villa for Thanksgiving Day instead of having our get-together at our parents' house, which can get crowded. There were 15 of us in total.

I recently stayed here for the first time. I had been to the pool bar in the past but never stayed here.

Came to the area for the holidays. Stayed for the weekend. Had no problem with the stay because we understood it was the weekend plus a holiday so therefore rates are higher.

Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue.

"Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos.

We walked the neighborhood, enjoying the people, sights, scents, and vibe of Lincoln Park. I had zero expectations when I checked in, and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days. The decor was classic and a bit whimsical. I loved it!",1

"Most friendly employees and always looked happy which is hard to find now days. Clean rooms great breakfast nice pool and had free cookies,tea/coffee/ hot chocolate in the lobby all the time which was pleasing to my kids! Was 3 minutes from six flags!",1
"This Four Points proved a good choice for my quick, two night stay in Columbus. Staff was friendly, room was clean, and the price was reasonable. The building appears to be relatively new.

"the room/bath was clean and airy, price OK (late March) and free breakfast fine. we had some room mechanical problems (door lock, heater cover) but they were fixed. We toured Butte homse and mining and needed a quiet place to collapse at night - this place fit the need.",1
"We were very pleased with the cleanliness and size of our suite. It would have been nice to have a hot tub, but the pool was large and very well kept. My son used the fitness center and he was very pleased with the equipment they had. We would definitely stay there again.",1
"Our first room had an interior door that led to the adjacent room and the lock was broken. So, we asked for another room. The next room smelled like someone had burnt a pack of cigarettes as incense in the room. We booked a non-smoking room. At that point we were just glad to have a room where all the doors locked. I would not stay here again",0
"Bad: Room was too dark, insufficient lamps/lights. Heater was ok, not great. Food in restaurant mediocre and service poor. Good: Excellent bed, great decor throughout. Fascinating space, great history. Boiler room really cool and good service",1
I have stayed at this hotel for the past several years and find it to be well kept and clean. Staff are friendly and accommodating. It is located in a quiet part of town though remains close to a major road for easy access. Would recommend this location to others.,1
"This was a nice place to stay. Other than the lady at the front desk being a little grouchy, I have not complaints. The room was clean. Bed was very comfortable. There were not noise issues, it was amazingly quiet. I would stay there again.",1
Wonderful location and view. Food and services are excellent. Convenient to other areas of Kauai. We drove to many other areas of the island and found it very easy to get around. Any time we asked for information at the hotel they were very willing to help.,1
So much better than we expected for the price. The desk service was exceptionaly nice. I agree the mattress was a bit soft and we needed a reading light over the chair. Those aren't complaints just comments.Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.,1
"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1

I have always loves this hotel. Besides being close to the highway for easy assess to all the areas attractions. It is tucked away for peace of mind.,1

"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa.",1

"AC is central but controlled in office in blocks of 10 rooms. So if you are hot, they will turn it on, and if someone else complains they are cold, they turn it off. Craziest system I ever heard of. I was able to switch to a room with a window AC, but it was barely adequate to cool on... More",1
Hotel was quiet. Other than the AC that looked like it came out of a crack house and the worn out mattress and elevator it was fair.

Great,1
"You can walk to Arlington Cemetary the Iwo Jima Memorial from the hotel, as well as to a supermarket restaurants. The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!",1
"The room was a bit expensive for what it was, but the location is convenient if you're going for a Dodgers game, it's clean, and there's plenty of space in the rooms. I would stay again.",1
"This hotel was really nice, but it has very poor signage and is right up against another hotel. The wifi was poor and the breakfast was horrible. I ended up buying breakfast foods at walmart and ate in my room. The room and the interior of the hotel was excellent. Very clean, and quiet. Bring your own pillow though if... More",1
"Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark! Overall attention to details is lacking. The front desk staff are polite and helpful. The HVAC unit works well and is relatively quiet.",1
"With no great expectations we stayed at Sea Crest as a stop over on our way to LAX. We were very happy with the well appointed room with a beautiful view.

"The Found:RE is a great new hotel in Phoenix. My co-worker and I had such a good experience there. It was a perfect location. Staff were amazing, and very helpful. Even though they were still renovating certain areas (hotel has only been open for 2 weeks) it was an all around great place to stay. Thank you for your understanding while we are still putting the final touches on things. We're so happy to hear our Curators were able to make your stay more enjoyable. Please come back and see us again!",1
sofa that pulled out to bed was very uncomfortable. Springs were coming thru mattress. We had to get extra comforts to make it sleepable.,1
The manager that night was excellent.,1
"Unfortunately, we had an emergency as soon as we walked off the plane. I received a phone call that my brother had passed away. When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring.",1
Bad: HODO lounge service was poor.,1
"Hampton Inns are always my first choice when I travel. They are always clean, the staff extremely friendly, the rooms clean and nice, the breakfast delicious. They are an amazing value for the price. There is always a gym and a pool and everything is always well maintained.",1

"This was my second time at this hotel. I'm glad that I had stayed here before because this trip was not too comfortable, at least at first.

The pool is refreshing, and the owners are very friendly and attentive. But the best part was the many other people staying there who sit outside their rooms at various... More",1
The hotel is clean and pretty much up-to-date. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The annoying thing sometimes can be that the heating or a/c can be really noisy. The trick is to heat/cool up your room enough during the day time so that you can shut it completely down during the night.,1
"Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!",1
Perfect for a group of baseball boys. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast selection was the only thing that could improve but wasn't that big of a deal. Location was good for the boys to walk to fast food away from trafficWe are very happy to hear that our location was ideal for your team. We appreciate your business and hope to host your team again in the future.,1
"Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby.",0
"It would be really nice if when a hotel is under construction, that is stated before it is booked so we can then make a decision if we want to deal with it or not. It really is not a surprise you want when you get there. When I walked into my room there were caulk guns on the floor and other construction materials laying around. How does that get missed when the room is cleaned",1
"It's a standard Embassy Suites, just super overpriced. Staff is friendly. Saw a roach at breakfast. And overall, breakfast is pretty basic/tasteless. Good location - shuttles to reagan and pentagon city metro. No shuttles to IAD. Considering there are so many other similarly priced places in the area - no loyalty to return here. Not a very distinguishing experience either way - Standard big corporate hotel experience.",1
"It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed.",1
"Excellent, clean hotel with great, included breakfast and friendly, helpful staff.",1
"Located centrally, Westin Poinsett makes a good choice for a peaceful stay in SC. You can walk up to multiple small shops , cafes, restaurants and even a supermarket and wine shop. Rooms are comfortable though breakfast could have been better spread-out.",1

"This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price.",0
My husband and I had a relaxing time. Our room was overlooking the ocean. The room was spotless and the staff is very cordial and accommodating. The hotel is close to downtown so you have access to shops and restaurants. We will definitely return to SeaCrest!,1
"All was wonderful, courteous staff, good choice of breakfast items, clean and quiet. Was surprised that the room thermostat would not respond to my setting, it was programmed to a pre-set temp which was a little too warm for my liking.",1
"I had booked a room via a 3rd party, but arrived late and the only room available was one for people with pets. I couldn't take that spring allergies would have had me sneezing all night in such a room. So the manager graciously gave me a suite at the same price. Nice service!",1
"Just an amazing place. You are treated like a king all the time. This place has ruined me for all other hotels. I am going again this weekend and cannot wait. Maria Christine Duhon and Liubov were amazing. They took care of everything and made sure my wife and I were happy.

"2 nights in the Aria were pure luxury. We had an interconnecting room with our teens and so lots of space for us to be tidy and them to make a mess! Obviously this is Vegas so everything else was expensive - the restaurants and parking etc, but as a treat it was perfect. The staff we met were polite... More",1
I've stayed at numerous hotels over the past year and this room was by far the best. The room came with sofa and office space in addition to the king size bed. Surely I will stay there again.,1
"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!",1
Our first room had a problem with the shower pressure and hot water so the staff was very helpful and understanding and gave us the room right next door (this was very gracious as we checked in late at night and it wasn't a hassle to move our stuff to another room).

"The room wasn't all that I was led to believe it was. According to Ali, it was the best room in the hotel and it was big and spacious enough to accommodate myself and my 4 friends. I was celebrating my birthday. The location in proximity to the boardwalk was good but the neighborhood was kind of shady. The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that.",1
This is a basic hotel near the airport. It is not fancy but is not dirty or run down.,1
"Good: A marvelous location, very friendly crew, it's clear hotel where you feel you are in Boston!",1
This is an older Embassy Suites that has been very well maintined and updated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro.,1

"Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.",0
"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge",1
very pleasant staff,1
The chilis down the road is a little wait but the food and service is amazing. Nightlife is a drive but it's nice to park your car at one and walk I drive. The beds are a little hard but still got a good nights sleep.,1
"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.",1
The hotel property and rooms were very clean. Rooms were very quiet. I would definite recommend this hotel for business travelers and pleasure travelers. The suite set up of the rooms are perfect for families.,1
"I really liked this hotel. The staff was great, the room was nice, TV was huge. We basically got into our room, changed into swimsuits, and hit the beach. The hotel is right on the beach. The boardwalk was really nice after sunset. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"Bad: The shuttle to Disney was not direct. Good: Polite and knowledgable staff , great lobby and breakfast .",1
I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .,0
I had a great experience at this hotel. Everybody is friendly and the rooms are very clean. I utilized the fitness center to help me maintain my work out regiment. Kendra was my favorite employee. I would definitely stay here again because of the ease of access in location and friendly customer service.,1
Small but comfortable. Staff was friendly. Room was relatively quiet considering the nearness to a busy street and freeway. Parking lot was easy to get in and out of if you use the sidestreet entrance. Close of lots of places to eat. Saved me a lot of commute time to LA. Breakfast was good. Food was fresh and lots to...

"They were very friendly when I booked my 246.00 with tax a night kitchenette room for that price you would expect a nice room. NOT!!! Room was very run down and walked into the bathroom and see roaches, totally grossed us out. I should have looked at other reviews before I took the room to see other people complaining about...

"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon.",1
"I went with my extended family (brothers, kids, uncle and grand parent), we took more than 9 rooms for a week. We had great vacation! Friendly staff, great pool, near the beach. room are clean. The wifi is not very performing, that would be my only complain.",1
"Rooms were large, bed was comfortable, location was adequate. Motel needs some serious updates. Renovations are a must. Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots. My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed.",0
The room we had was very clean and the hotel is perfect walking distance to everything in Gatlinburg.. Loved the pool and free breakfast as well! They also had free popcorn in the lobby which was very nice. The hotel was better than what I thought it'd be and I recommend to anyone!,1
We were satisfied with our accommodations but were surprised by a 9 parking fee. We were not aware of the fee before hand and this should be disclosed when booking the hotel.,1
A quiet and beautiful hotel with an awesome location. Comfortable rooms and extremely friendly staff. Very easy check in/out. Plenty of dining and night life in the immediate area and some rooms have an amazing view of the square.,1
"Love this hotel. Clean, great location and friendly staff! Hotel bar has great food also. We look forward to staying here and have done so for the last 4 years. About 10 minutes from Columbus Crew (now know as Mapfre Stadium) and close to the airport.",1
"Friendly desk staff, fairly clean, and reasonably comfortable (albeit slightly worn) mattresses. However, a few major disappointments: -Water is overly softened and slimy making it almost impossible to rinse off soap. Probably the worst I have ever experienced at a hotel. - A/C setting gets overridden in the middle of the night and the room gets very warm and uncomfortable... More",1
"Good location, nice place.... but make sure to avoid the travel desk upon arrival, they only push (hard) to make you attending 2 hour presentation against free breakfast, selling or promoting Whyndham club . Guess the lady at the travel desk get a good commission for each person she signs up for this breakfast meeting, would not let us go unless we signed up on spot after arrival...tired and after a long day travelling it was quite annoying.",1
A pleasant stop on a drive to Florida ... Great room- only complaint - no where to eat at that exit Clean hotel with a friendly staff. In room fridge and coffee machine and very quiet Good place to stay on the road- we've stayed at a few others,1
"Outstanding property, amenities and location. Very quiet and comfy rooms. The staff is 5 ***** Highly recommend! Easy access to down town dinning, theaters, Water sports or just a great place to vegetate!",1
"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again.",1
Quiet and restful with helpful service and friendly people. The hotel is beautiful with gorgeous blooming flowers right outside my door. Breakfast is provided and room tips give helpful information. I highly recommend!,1
Good: everithing beyond our expectations.,1
The weather was amazing. The parking garage is challenging. All in all a great trip.,1
We needed an overnight stop for our travels from Minnesota to Illinois. This hotel worked out great. Very clean and comfortable. Slept well. Breakfast vouchers for attached Perkins restaurant were great!,1
"Clean and nicely appointed. Rooms are a good size and up to date .. Breakfast is hot with plenty of food that you would expect to see. with a nice cheerful and clean eating area. Service is very good (we had a room changed due to a noisy neighbor , which sure isn't the hotels fault) Of course there are... More",1
love them!! everyone is super nice. never have we had any issues with our booking or our room. good location. had a problem with our car and had to leave it there for a week and they were nice enough to let us keep it there while we figured out how to get it back home lol,1
All of the out of town family and friends attending the wedding stayed at the Hampton. The service was great and we especially appreciated the ability to gather as a group each evening in the breakfast seating area without any complaint.,1
"We were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The owner and staff were all very friendly and accommodating. We were visiting friends in the area and stayed here 3 nights. For a budget hotel, you won't find a nicer place. This is an older hotel but it was very well kept. The rooms were clean and quiet. The beds were... More",1
I was very disappointed with my stay . I was charged 270.00 dollars to my credit card for so called damage. I call to see what they were talking about and ask for pictures to be sent to my e mail .and ask to speak to Manger. Got the run around got hung up on after trying to see what they were talk about . Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean . Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !,0
Good: The staff was really friendly and the free coffee was good. The location was excellent. The hotel's restaurant was quite good too.,1
"Contemporary rooms in a great old building. Friendly staff, wonderful Italian restaurant right next door. Within short walking distance to so many great Chicago attractions. My new favorite hotel in Chicago!",1
"This is a great hotel in a quite spot, walking distance to downtown Cedar Rapids. The interior is dated but clean, same with the rooms. Plenty of free parking.",1
"Got this hotel because of proximity to water park next door, booked kind of late so had to get a king suite. Room was great and spacious, had a king bed and a small pull out couch. Bathroom and room were clean and liked that it had a microwave and a small fridge in room. Only had a shower, which... More",1
"We chose the Grand Hyatt Kauai for the first here nights of our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was amazing - the staff were super helpful, the grounds are amazing and the food was great. In particular, the sushi at Stevensons Library is probably the best we've had (the tempura roll epic). Dinner at Tidepools was pretty good, a bit... More",1
Stayed here 4 nights and were very pleased. Rooms were clean and well appointed.. It was comfortable and quiet. Also very close to everything. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Good breakfast. Would not hesitate to return.,1
This is the hotel if you're just needing a place to stay in Traverse City and do not need lake front property. Rooms were clean and comfortable. WIFI included and a complimentary shuttle which is great if you're trying to get around town to visit the breweries. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and inviting. I will definitely stay here again if I visit Traverse City.,1
"Hotel room was nice. My only complaints was no extra bedding readily available in rooms closet, as I am used to at other hotels and the restaurant inside of hotel was over priced for the limited amount of food options it had.",1
"We've visited DVR multiple times over the past 8 years, and we've been pleased each and every time. The facility is up-to-date, very clean, and full of things to do. Staff are friendly and helpful - and while you know they're available, they are never intrusive. There are plenty of things to do on the resort, whether you're 2 or... More",1
"I think the best thing this hotel has going for it, is that it is close to the hockey arena. It was my first time to Pittsburgh and it seems like a cool city and was looking forward to the view but I got a room on the wrong side. There are fake orchids in the room. I expected more.... More",1
I drove 9 hours from NC and happened to arrive eight hours before check in time . However I called the hotel and they let me check in hours earlier than I was scheduled to. Great customer service . Will be staying here again! The free breakfast is pretty great too!,1
"The room was very clean, but the AC could not be controlled and we froze at night. I could not turn it off and it ran all night long. I didn't have time to get the staff to fix it, so I just covered the vents with clothes to keep it from blowing out so much. We were still cold. The pool was nice, but the work out center was a joke and only on of three tread mills worked. And there was no weights or anything else. The Breakfast was a joke. There was only cereal and toast and that's it. We didn't even eat it, we just went out on our way to our events.",1
"We arrived in the Columbus area very late in the evening/early morning without a reservation thinking we would be able to find a room. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Most hotels were booked around the major interstate area. The Four Points held a room for us at their standard rate, upon arrival we let them know that we were... More",1
Bad: Place.,1
"I have stayed at this property for all most 10 years and the consistent level of service has never faulted. From the Manager Phillip to the House Keeping crew, front desk personnel, the kitchen staff and even engineering, they all are friendly and intent on making your stay a positive experience.",1
Bad: The only thing that makes me upset is the rate for car parking 70 dollars crazy but i went with it still a great place. Good: The hotel was wonderful the rooms very roomy the view fantastic 15th floor,1
"My car broke down two weeks ago on Route 18 and I had to pull over for the night because the weather was very bad. I asked for a smoking room. The room I was put in didn't have any ash trays and I had to walk down to the office to get the ashtrays myself, as the staff wouldn't... More",0
My wife abd I stayed here for our anniversary weekend. Clean hotel in need of updates. Food for breakfast was good. Loved tge made to order omelet. Pool not open and the restaurant had just open but the prices...ouch! Overall good bang for your dollar. Minutes from the flower fields and such.,1
Employees were great and rooms were really nice. Safe area.,1
"In town for soccer tournament, beds were soft, rooms were clean, It was a great stay.",1
Good: I loved having a microwave and fridge. Very cozy!,1
"Bad: No customer service and they try to bill you for everything, for everything. Good: I wish customer service would reply to my emails. I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever.",0
"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,",0
Spent one night here with our two toddlers while visiting the National Corvette Museum (they have three Corvette parking spaces) . Overall appearance was good. We stayed in one of the suites to use the separate bedroom for putting kids to bed and it's by the far the smallest suite we've ever stayed in. No place for a family of... More,1
Additional 15 charge a day for parking was ridiculous when there are no parking after 10 Pm. I have to park at park at your own risk,1
"Bad: Room was dingy and not well maintained. Paint job was messy, wallpaper was bubbled. Bathroom sink and shower were dirty and old. Good: The bed was comfortable.",1
At first I was not sure about booking a room at this hotel. Had stayed there many years ago and it wasn't quite what I had expected but was very pleasantly surprised. The room was a bit dated mostly by the size of the bathroom but other than that it was great. The beds were comfortable and it had the... More,1

"We use this hotel for our overnight on the way to and from the Summit Bechtel Reserve. This is a low price place that is close to SBR. The room is setup for 2 people, so if you have 3 or more get towels at the office first. The beds are small and If you request a roll a way you will need to do it at the office when you get there.",1
"Everyone was helpful, the area was easy to get around and the hotel was very clean and nice.",1
comfortable and hospitable...would definitely stay here again....a great value!,1
"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!",1
Great stay - very satisfied and pleased with the quality! Very conveniently located and very nice indoor pool! It was January but the outdoor pool looked nice! As a courtesy because the room was not ready they gave us free breakfast and a movie - and a different great room. very clean and good service.,1
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar.",1
"This hotel gave us a perfect location for our short trip to Seattle. Located directly next to the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, the Monorail and Seattle Center was beyond our expectations!! They offered a shuttle to all locations within a mile and we used this many times. Clean and courteous shuttle drivers as well!",1
"If you are deciding which upscale priced ranch to experience for western adventures, stop right here, the Hideout is the place! The property is gorgeous-VERY well maintained.

If you like filth then this is the hotel for you! Bed Linens were not changed for maybe multiple times for one bedroom! Possible Dried Blood and possible Livestock hair on botth pillow cases! Unknown smell greeted us at door upon arrival.. They were also out of towels and had to share a towel among four people! Only thing going... More,0
"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out.",0
"Riverwalk and downstairs bar were super fun. Good music and fun dancing. The hotel itself, however, was really, really warm (no AC in the halls) and very run down. It seemed everyone was having a good time since you could clearly hear everything. This would be a super fun place to stay and party if you're full of energy and... More",1
"We had a nice time. Pool could have been a little warmer but my granddaughter love it. The breakfast was wonderful and very tasty the lady working that morning was so fun to talk to,,,she made you feel like you were at a restaurant she did her job very well. The front desk people were friendly and the hot cookies were delicious....",1
"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...",0
"I stayed here 6 nights and the hotel staff are great, the shuttle drivers very friendly the rooms are clean and I was pleasantly surprised that Monday and Tuesday dinner was offered! Those are the hardest days to go back to the hotel after work and not having to go out was refreshing. Breakfast is free ever day. Pool closes... More",1
"Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy",1
"Excellent in all areas: staff, suite, helpfulness, extremely clean, housekeeping a real plus, location , beach view, very close to shopping and restaurants. I could live here full time. Celebrated wedding anniversary, roses and champagne in the room upon arrival a very nice touch. I will surely be back.",1
Love this clean new modern hotel ! The front desk crew is simply awesome professional and very caring ! They go out of their way to make sure I had a fresh made salad for a late bite. These gentleman are just simple the best across the country hands down !,1
Pool was closed to early 9p.m. It was hot wanted to cool down.,0
"Bad: Air conditioning wasn't working when we arrived, but the maintenance person fixed it. Good: Location friendly staff.",1
"We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con",1
"We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel.",1
It's too bad there's no continental breakfast. But the room was suprisingly comfortable for the price.,1
"This is an okay hotel. While we were there, the ice machines were not working the hotel staff had us retrieve ice from the kitchen in the lobby. That was the only big inconvenience for us. We stayed on the first floor, near the pool. The cleanliness of the room was a concern for me. I had to ask housekeeping... More",1
"Better than expected ,big room with sofa bed,walking distance to beach,new building,great breakfast.",1
Would recommend to anyone. Room service was fabulous,1
We felt like home. We are planning to go back in the near future. The staff is very polite. Viginia Suites is within walking distance from mass transit and that make it easy to travel to the main atractions in Washington D.C. We highly recommend Virginia Suites to any one planning to visit Washington.,1
"Was looking for a quite hotel off the strip and it totally fit. Property and room were average, but very clean and quiet. Staff was great. Food at their caf was very good. Convenient to use monorail, station was just across the road.",1
"Would be happy to give 6 stars if I could. Outstanding in every way. Service is the stand out. Everyone was exceptional. The room was very nice and the bed was the coziest ever. Food was great! Wish the door that connects the adjoining room was better. Better locks and a heavier door would be appreciated. Otherwise, all was really... More",1
