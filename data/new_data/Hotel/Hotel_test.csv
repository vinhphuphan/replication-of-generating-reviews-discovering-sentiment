Everything was Ok But not great Staff seemed to not want to be there,1
"These little villas are surprisingly clean for the price. I liked that there was no carpet in our villa (Room 113- queen bed) because there's nothing worse than stepping on old, icky motel carpets. The floor was wood laminate that looked newly installed. The bathroom was fine except it did have a shower stall, so the space was a bit... More",1
"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge",1
"The Red Lion is owned by the same corporation that owns the Vineyard Inn, also in McMinnville. The Red Lion is a perfectly adequate hotel. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping adequate. The breakfast offered is OK--not gourmet, but gets you going in the morning. The Red Lion is a little quieter than the Vineyard Inn, since it is... More",1
What a find! We two couples were looking for an overnight stay in Temecula and hit the jackpot. Met Chef Dean early in the day and he made wonderful recommendations for a place to have lunch and a number of wineries to visit. In the afternoon we enjoyed drinks on the patio and then went to dinner at an Afghani... More,1
"After driving on the road for 1200 miles the staff was great, The room was very nice and extremely spacious. The following morning the breakfast provided was great, hot coffee, hot eggs,hash browns, sausage, muffins. It was a very nice breakfast and the front desk staff actually remembered my name as I was walking up to the desk. Would recommened... More",1
Good: I loved the fact that staff was very understandable and after a very tough night (shooting and evacuation of the whole Strip) let us stay complimentary till 4pm. This was really exceptional service and hospitality. Thank you!,1
I stayed for one week and had a clean and comfortable experience at this Hampton location. The staff was friendly and helped without question. Complimentary breakfast and lunch snack packs were great and appreciated during the rush of the mornings.,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.",1
"Bad: Delays in checkin, no liquor license yet!. Good: Location room",1
"One window, opens to walkway, no cross ventilation. It's convenient and that's about it. Free breakfast, free snoring nose strips!",1
"My daughter is a student at Virginia Tech, we had traveled down to attend farm day. The hotel is close, clean, good breakfast (except the eggs, they taste weird). Gotta be aware even tho this is not a tourist area, there is a big difference between season and off-season rates, I did the same exact trip a month (june) ago and it was 40 less a night",1
We had an excellent stay and was very satisfied with this place! Everyone really enjoyed their room and the hospitality! The rooms were very spacious and super clean! The staff was very professional right from the start and continued through check out. The breakfast was very good and hot! I will definitely continue to seek Best Western as my first... More,1
"Right off the interstate, over priced for the rooms and their current condition. Rug in the room stained and room smelled moldy. Checked out early....",1
"I was here with my teenaged son. We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, well-maintained hotel in a residential part of Santa Barbara just a short walk from the mission, and a short walk from downtown. His post-op visit this time only required a one-night stay. However, last summer after he required a medical procedure, we spent over two weeks... More",1
The room was small but very comfortable. Beautiful area with lots shopping!,1
Good: location was close to strip 5 min staff were excellent,1
We are frequent guests. We don't stay anywhere else in Boise. The staff always takes good care of us. Found the hotel because they are pet friendly but also enjoy all the great amenities. I always recommend the Oxford Suites.,1
We picked this hotel for price and location - it's a quick drive to the MFAH and walking distance from the George Brown Convention Center. We had a number of restaurants (mostly chains) and bars within walking distance to choose from. The hotel itself was exactly what we wanted - clean and well staffed. We'd happily stay there again.,1
Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton,0
Very nice hotel...close to WWI Museum which we visited. Parking garage was close and secure. Room service was very nice and staff were quite courteous. Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay.,1
We stayed at the Aira hotel in September 2016 great room great hotel very clean one warning dont buy the in room water 12.00 for 700ml walk outside to supermarket 3.00 for 1 Litre same brand maybe the Yorkshire Yorkshire man in me.,1
We were in town to visit family in Corpus and had never stayed at The Tarpon Inn. My children were with us so we needed enough room for 5 and room 42 was perfect! AND they are pet friendly. Being within walking distance to so many restaurants was a bonus. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Will recommend to my... More,1
"We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot).",1
Got a great room on top floor great service great deal! Close to Tampa Airport and beautiful property/gardens - wish we had more time to explore! Loved the Starbucks in the room spacious foyer/bathroom and comfy beds too,1
2 adults and 1 child the 4th floor. Very clean throughout the room hotel. Staff gave lots of suggestions for places to eat places to visit. Free breakfast until 10am lots of choices. Would definitely stay here again.,1
We arrived in Atlanta on a Saturday around 9pm for a one night stay during a cross country trip. We had two rooms booked and called ahead a few days prior to specifically request connecting rooms. The front desk clerk was a very nice lady. For some reason the note about connecting rooms wasn't in the reservation. The clerk apologized... More,1
Right on the beach and close to the shops. not to far from all the bars and grill off the boardwalk . the guest service was great. Yolanda the office person was very nice and sweet. will deff stay here again next year.,1
This place has been renovated but not 100 percent. There are still some quirks and in some spots areas of improvement . The shower curtain is all plastic rubber and one of the Windows lacked a curtain and only had slats that faced the street. My colleague said they couldn't sleep due to a loud fan going on and off... More,1
"I stayed for one night on my way to Indiana. Let's just say that you get what you pay for. It's was an ok stay. The room was kinda small, it needed several touch ups on the furniture/bathroom fixtures, the pillows were not good for the neck, and the bathroom was tiny. The good things were that the customer service was good and it was a nice location for exploring around town.",1
"Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast. Good: Location - room - clean - right in front of public library of Boston",1
Every thing was good. Could use a bit of a facelift but not critical. Pool looked nice but did not have time to use.,1
"Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza. The hotel is awesome. Shuttle will take you anywhere you need to go nearby. Hotel was service was spot on. Loved my room. Cannot go wrong with Hyatt Place. Clean, Comfy, spacious, reasonably priced. Highest recommendation.",1
"I stay here at least once a year for the last 3. I hate the strip hotels/traffic, this is a great alternative to the strip but within minutes if you are going to the strip or any where else in Vegas and minutes from the airport and only a minute from the freeway. Quiet, clean, comfortable and nice staff.",1
"This is my second stay at this hotel. My room was quiet and clean. I was a little concerned as it looked like there wer a few more lomg-term renters than before. The front desk in the evening was friendly. In the morning not as helpful. But for the price it was a good stay. But next time, I'll probably... More",1
"Hotel was clean convenient. Staff was friendly. The view from our room was nice until we looked down saw a huge, ugly retaining pond.",1
"This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!",1
Bad: No self parking.. had to reach down to flush toilet. Good: Location,1
"First it looks like something happen in the beach and a bunch of dead fish are laying on the sand, as soon as the sun comes out the smell is extremely bad. Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!",1
"We stayed for two nights at the Maritime Hotel. The location is great, being right across the street from the Chelsea Market with lots of great food. Close to subway station. The lobby is cozy and well appointed with tables, books, long couches and a fireplace blazing all the time. The room was small, but beautiful with wood finishes and a large round window (which opened - a definite plus). I will definitely stay here again.",1
"I was only here for a one night stay but was so impressed with the room, the amenities, the staff and the views from the rooftop pool that I plan on returning in the future for a longer stay. The Sunday Brunch was excellent!",1
Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location,1
Stayed here for the first night as we got in late from our flight from Vancouver. Front desk was great and very helpful on where everything was within the hotel. AC was noisy but this hotel is not exactly new so units are in the window. Very clean though and lots of charm. Would recommend for short stays. Great location... More,1
"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are.",1
"We arrived to the hotel and was greeted by a welcoming staff, the lobby is tastefully decorated in the San Antonio style. Very clean and the staff are very pleasant and super helpful willing to go the extra mile for their customers. The owner of the hotel even took the time to personally come to our table to welcome us... More",1
"was too quick, but very nice area",1
Hotel was easy to locate and very clean. Bed was not comfortable.,1
The rooms were brand new with huge balconies. A glass wall opened to the balcony so that the room was fully open to the outside. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous and the hotel was in a great location. Each unit had a full kitchen and the pool area was what you expect from a much more expensive resort.... More,1
"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan",1
"Horrible smelly roomsasked for our money back ,since we could not have stayed in this place with my daughter having difficulties breathing in that smell.They told us they will refund-well,the money was never returned to my account.Even when asked a several times.Rude staff.",0
"Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE.",1
This is a hotel with good rooms and nice staff. The location relative to the DC downtown is not the best but the hotel offers very good shuttle service to a metro station. I highly recommend this hotel.,1
Excellent service,1
"That was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. Well, actually the second Super 8 in a row that was so awful. Everything was so dirty that we didn't even take our clothes off when we went to bed. The towels had stains all over, the bathroom floor was covered in black hair, the bathtub had soap scum...

"Pulled in late. No prob getting a room that allowed our small dog. Room was non-smoking, fresh, and clean! Got a hot shower and good nights sleep. Don't know how the free breakfast was, walked next door to Denny's instead. Would definitely stay here again.",1
"I checked in my room at about 5pm and after I paid money ave entered my room it was horrible. I left rode around until about 12am. The room had roaches crawling, they had moth balls in the drawer, under the mattress, under the bed. I kept itching sleeping in the bed so I laid in the hard floor, I... More",0
"The pool was out of order because the heat pump wasnt working,yeah right it was because they didnt want turn the heat on period.and breakfast was nothing what there pictures advertised ewwww!!",1
I was highly satisfied with my accommodations. The room was most comfortable and spacious. Very easy to locate and access. Staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Everything I could have needed was available for meal preparation. The bed and pillows were of very high quality. I enjoyed my stay very much. I would recommend this facility without hesitation.,1
"Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well. I wish bathroom had better privacy and ventilation.Location : fantastic, close to all attractions.Restaurant : I didnot try, so I don't know.Overall: nice experience , will be back.Happy to hear your enjoyed your stay overall and will be back we look forward to it!! Sorry about the delay getting you checked in, while we do our best to schedule according to our needs we occasionally run into unexpected busy periods. We will be sure to keep that under our radar.See you again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Overall hotel was good except for breakfast it was the worst I've experienced area is way to small and choices of food on the cheap side. Also nothing is around the hotel it's by itself.,1
"We stayed in this place 2 years ago. We were in the front building and paid about 70. Since we were doing the Sebring 12 Hour Race, this price was reasonable even in light of what you got in the room. It was clean but dated broken furniture, very thin, chintzy towels, a paper bath mat. This year, we... More",0
"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful.",1
"The only thing about the Red Roof inn is its in the corner and it's tucked away from everything... so for me who didn't have a vehicle it's kind of difficult navigate to like the store and things like that I mean, but there are few places within walking distance...",1
We were expecting a nice lodge and so it seemed for the pictures. However each unit is rented out as two rooms. We had the upper room with small kitchen for 189 per night. The place was like Travelodge or super8. Clean but very basic and small. The bathroom was smallest we've ever had. The cupboard doors are metal and... More,1
"We spent several days here as a rest stop on a long bicycle tour. The person at the desk was very helpful. We were checked in well before the standard check-in time. The room is spacious, well arranged, and comfortable. Breakfast is tasty. Cookies at 7pm. Convenient walk to great restaurants and wine tasting rooms. Clean room and great air... More",1
"We planned a last minute 4th of July trip and was lucky enough to snatch up a cancellation at the Crooked Hook Resort. Chuck and Sharon were extremely helpful. They answered questions over the phone, through email, and assisted us practically all hours of the day while we were there. I could have easily spent half of my vacation hanging... More",1
We stayed at Celina Motel for three nights. It is a very nice little motel located less than 4 blocks from the lake and right on the edge of town. The rooms were nice and clean the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was large for a motel bathroom. We were very pleased with our stay and will definately... More,1
I like coming here just because I need a clean and close place to sleep in the city.,1
We stopped here one night on our way down to NC. Linda at the front desk was very friendly. Our room was clean and spacious but the walls were very thin as I could hear a conversation going on in the next room very clearly. When we checked in there was some kind of party going on and it was... More,1
Good: Bed and shower were awesome,1
Well laid out floor plan. Comfy and roomy. Shower water pressure was a little low for me but well designed bathroom. Would stay here again. Cheaper parking 1/2 block away(4 on weekends).,1
I had my wedding at Elmwood Gardens in Palestine and reserved a large block of rooms for my wedding. The rooms were large and comfortable. They have great breakfast and they even let my guests and I hang out in the lobby after the wedding! It was so much fun and the service was great! In the weeks leading up... More,1
"The location is great. The room had some very nice touches Bose wave radio, the ability to open the window a bit, nice views, marble bathroom with a TV built into the mirror, good selection of snacks and drinks for purchase. The room and hotel is spotless, staff very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend and will stay again.",1
"Have stayed at Litson many times. If you are looking for a five star hotel experience this is not it - I would call it semi rustic. Litson's has small but nice cabins, each as it''s own parking space, a little deck area with table and chairs, most (or all ) have a kitchenette. Prices are great, and you can... More",1
Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel,1
"The room was fine, but was very small. You could not walk around the room with a suitcase on the floor. The bags had to be on the bed to walk around and on the floor to sleep. I think the room was approximately 14 X 14 with 2 beds. Decorating and cleanliness were fine, just small.",1
"While not directly on the river walk, this hotel provides a driver named Joe that really enjoys his job of driving people to the river walk and other downtown locations. They also have a reception most night with snacks, beer, wine. Fantastic experience. You can tell this hotel is run by people that want to do a great job!",1
"cant think of anything Location, helpful staff, quiet room, good beds, wifi and breakfast.",1
Great value,1
Good: Have been there four or five times so I think that tells you all,1
Just stayed as had to catch a flight at BWI airport after a long drive. I would rate this a 2 star hotel.,0
"Three of us stayed here on Saturday and Sunday while in town for the NASCAR race and we could not have stayed at a nicer place, literally and figuratively.

The beds and pillows were soft and comfy!!! Staff was very friendly! The free continental breakfast was great with lots of choices. They even offered complimentary water with oranges all day to guests. The pool and basketball court are great for kids! We would stay here again for sure!,1
"Nice hotel with Outdoor pool. No complementary coffee and bar closes early to get one there. A bit complicated with the billing process, but willing to solve it and did it as promised. Rooms have plenty of room. Limited selection of TV channels.",1
Great place to stay for the price. Newly remodeled and well maintained. Closeness to interstate is very good. Easy access with plenty of places to eat and shop. Quaint small town. Felt very safe staing there,1
"My wife and I have stayed at this BW a number of times and have always been completely satisfied with it. The people who manage it are very nice and helpful, as are other staff members, and we've never had a problem with noise (but we always get a room on the non-freeway side). It is tucked away in a...

"I didn't have enough space to take my family in on their visit to the city while I was living in Wrigleyville, so this spot was the best place to accommodate them in the neighborhood and we were able to avoid the taxi rides back and forth into the city where the majority of guests can stay.

I stayed at Grand Coulee Center Lodge one night on a business trip in January 2015.

I found out later that two hotels had... More,1

"This Baton Rouge Marriott is centrally located to highways, central business center, restaurants and shopping. The hotel is clean and staff are polite and helpful. The hotel itself is extremely outdated and drab. In the hotels defense, the advertise their upcoming renovation. Try to avoid rooms facing the highway if you are in need of a quite nights sleep.",1
"We booked this hotel after a brief search on the web for three days at the beginning of a month long US trip. We were so delighted with it that we rebooked for our last 24 hours.

"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",1
"What one would expect for an RC property. The restaurant was excellent and the room was spacious and comfortable. It is near many restaurants and the Metro station is right in front for an affordable commute into D.C. All things considered, a great pick for you stay in the D.C. area.",1
"very noisy at night, from people walking around and talking in the hallway. not recommend.",1
Everything was very nice for the price. Convenient to the city and comfortable.,1
"I don't want to be repetitive - but have no hesitation in staying at this hotel. It is a wonderful hotel, and the grounds are spectacular. We stayed in Room 5048 - I was concerned as this was over one of the restaurants, but noise was never a problem. The view was wonderful, we could hear the surf, and the... More",1

Room good size , the bed was not comfortable- too lumpy, nice size bathroom but CAUTION the marble used on the shower floor... More",1
"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",1
"We rented a cabin/cottage from Birch Bay Get Away for a few days over the Christmas holiday. Our cottage - Sandlewood - offered two bedrooms, full bath, living room and compete kitchen at an extremely reasonable rate. Plus dogs are welcome for an additional/nominal fee. Everything was clean, comfortable, and only a short walk to the beach. We were delighted... More",1
We enjoyed the food very much and our server was great. Lasagne was special. No push to order wine. We had enough earlier. Nice atmosphere.,1
"The room was very clean and beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were so very nice. The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the midst of downtown but not so loud that one cannot rest. We had the best time and this hotel, by far, is one of my favorites. We love the City of New Orleans... More",1

"I love this Best Western Plus hotel, because I know I will have a pleasant stay. To begin with, the hotel bed and pillows were inviting, allowing me to have a good nights sleep. After my peaceful sleep I enjoyed a nice breakfast from the on-site restaurant. Checking out was a breeze, allowing me to get to destination quickly. I... More",1
"The reviews on this Best Western are all over the range of scores, but we all stayed at the same motel. Go figure! This is a basic services motel in an upscale county (Napa). Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. I can't speak to the ammenities since we just used the Best Western as a place to sleep, clean up and hit the road.",1
The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.,0
Breakfast wasn't te best but beside that everything else was perfect. They supplied us with an extra crib and crib sheet. Help with any question we had and the staff was extremely generous.,1
"First of all, the staff was very nice. However, I was very disappointed in this hotel. The rooms are supposed to be 100 percent smoke free, but the smoke smell hit the second I walked in the room. I called the front desk to ask to be transferred to another room but none were available. The front desk kindly offered... More",0
"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms",1
"Had our daughters wedding at the Omni Royal Orleans. All the staff was beyond fantastic. Everyone had a great time, the location of the property could not have been better. The quality of the hotel is great. We had a suite and it was perfect.",1
"Nice hotel clean, comfortable,close to restaurants and shops.",1
There was Hair in the pool there was hair in the bathroom there was hair in the hotel room there was hair everywhere. There was a night club in the hotel of some sort that made it impossible to park and made my 2 kids and I feel unsafe in the parking lot.,0
"WE really enjoyed this hotel! It was Very clean, Everyone was really nice, and helpful. We checked in thanksgiving Eve, and stayed until Sunday. Even the Overnight staff was really kind, My son wanted popcorn after we came in from the pool, and we didn't have any cash on us. A staff member paid for the popcorn themselves, and handed...

Great boutique hotel in the heart of Prescott. Each room has its unique design and decor. I stay every month for work. The bed linens are amazingly soft. The room and bathroom is very clean. Staff is wonderful.,1
"Good access form 95, but quiet. Clean comfortable room and good value with a coupon rate. Steps away from Ruby Tuesdays where you can order take out meals on-line form your room. Good breakfast selection and coffee to get you going in the morning.",1
Bad: Rooms are a bit small and food is mediocre. Good: Atmosphere overall was chill. Great after busy workday.,1
Dropped by Pittsburgh overnight on the way to DC. Marriott staff bent over backwards to accommodate us by upgrading our room to two double beds. Bell staff went above and beyond to guide us to PNC Park to take in a Pirates game. Excellent stay!,1
"Great family resort Plenty of rooms, your able to cook your own dinner to save some money or even barbecue by the pool. Kids loves the many different swimming pools. Close to everything, the times grocery store is right across the property. The beach is easy access, great place to watch the sunset.",1
"Business trip, stay was pleasant and convenient",1
Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel.,0
"Nice New Hampton Hotel. Rooms were very clean, Comfy Beds. Close to walking paths and down town Napa. Staff was friendly ! Great place to stay. Walking paths along the Napa River make it nice way to start the day.Dear Paul O,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our comfy beds and that you we're able to take advantage of our walking path that runs along the river just behind the hotel. We look forward to serving you again in the near future. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
"I booked online as we were driving back late from Maryland. We needed a reasonably priced room to rest before heading home. The first thing we noticed when we walked inside was the decor! it felt much more upscale than any other Quality Inn that we had stayed in before. Very post modern. Johnny, the night manager that checked us... More",1
"We will be back! Food and drink free... Wonderfully accommodating staff especially Asia :). Free dinner, drinks, and hot breakfast! Seriously huge rooms! Room for 6 easily! We will try to stay at all the Drury Inns! Wahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!",1
Bad: Hidden fees for amenities.,1
"We had an amazing time and love it there. Quaint cottages, beautiful pool and a fun game room. The family who owns it is incredibly sweet. Overall I'd rate it a 10 if I could. The beds were comfy, everything was clean, the tables and outside chairs make it a great place to relax and enjoy the fresh air.",1
"Rooms are spacious, clean, and staff are excellent. The ONE thing that stood out (unfortunately), was the coffee. I am a coffee drinker. I've had too many brands to count. The coffee used at this hotel is absolutely the worst I have ever had. It has a terrible after-taste, something like 1-part coffee and 1-part dirt from the parking lot.... More",1
"The service at the hotel was very good, friendly staff especially the valets. The only downside to our stay was the extremely hot temperature in the room, thermostat did nothing to improve the situation. We only stayed one night so we dealt with it.",1
"Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice.",1
My family was returning back to Iowa from spending a weekend in Door County WI. We enjoyed our overnight stay at the Appleton Fairfield. The front desk staff was more than accommodating by checking the temperature of the pool upon my wifes request. The room (118) was clean and smelled fresh great job by cleaning staff. The breakfast was warm... More,1
I didn't notice that this hotel room has shared bathroom. It was very inconvenient for me.,1
"First time visiting the Hollywood area and were pleasantly surprised with the whole area. Lots of great places to eat nearby and really enjoyed the beach with the chairs and towels provided. Did a lot of walking, especially with the broadwalk so near. Did not realize how important free parking was until we tried to take the car out --... More",1
Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.,1
"Our room was not very big, but it was clean, quiet, and comfortable. This hotel has a night watchman patrolling the grounds and it felt very safe. Parking was convenient. The staff was super friendly and helpful and the breakfast was more than adequate. The price was very good and we all felt like it was an excellent value for... More",1
"We have been to Beaver Creek a few times over the years, but this was the first time we stayed at the Pines. Well located outside the village but only a short walk (even shorter on the skiway) to the bridge and the village. Hotel has shuttle but we never used it because of the pleasant ski/walk to and from... More",1
It was a great stay,1
I have stayed at this location several times and this place has gone downhill. They spent a lot to upgrade it-now they need to invest in good staff and bring back the happy hour! I was put in a handicap accessible room-so if you need those types of rooms they are well equipped!,0
"The resort is very centrally located, and the staff was great. On the downside, the internet was really slow and at times, nonexistent. The units are clean but are in desperate need of updates. The old style vertical blinds let lots of light through, no way to block out light even in the bedroom and the shower head was a... More",1
"Old run down furniture, room needed to be repainted, peeling paint, curtains ripped and dirty, carpet ok, but room was not as clean as it should be. Only good items in room was bed, tv, refrigerator, microwave, balcony room, shower head. Bathroom wasn't properly cleaned and definitely needs to be spruced up. Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient.",0
"I wish I could separate the room experience from the breakfast experience but I can't because having breakfast included was a huge part of why we chose this hotel. Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here.",1
"A smaller hotel with a European feel, if you don't mind the 7-8 blocks to Peach Tree center, this is an excellent value. The rooms are clean, the service efficient and friendly, the food (breakfast is all we ate) well done. Surprisingly the wifi was very fast for a free service. On the down side, there is not much happening... More",1
"After driving all day from Maine , we stopped here during a rainy night. The reception was really nice...front desk very hospitable, the room was clean and the bed was comfy...the food delicious and the pet policy was really reasonable. This was a conference center so it was busy, busy..but I never felt looked over. The pool was nice and... More",1
"Loved our stay at Lifts West Condo, the manager Billy is helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable of the area. Already planning a family trip back with our kids and grands! Clean room, great location close to everything and within walking distance of all the cute shops on main!",1
We spent 4th of July weekend with family and friends at the Little Creel. The new owners were very friendly and helpful. They made it a point to check on us often and made sure everything was going ok! We had an amazing weekend there!,1
Good: Staff members very helpful and friendly,1
Our stay was excellent! I don't normally give high scores but the hotel and staff were top-notch. Our room was clean and cool. Any time we needed to ask a staff member a question the staff member smiled and was generous in giving information of where things were in the City of Salina and Abilene. I rate the hotel overall a five.,1
I admit that I have never stayed at a Best Western property ever before now. I loved this hotel!!!! This hotel was fabulous! The staff was friendly and courteous. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to hotels. This hotel met or exceeded all of my high expectations. The location of this... More,1
"We wrote a review on Feb. 27, 2013 and a lot of it is still relevant with the exception of a couple items from our most recent visit. We stayed here on Feb. 7, 2016 in Room 280. There was no Wi-Fi connectivity. If you need to have Wi-Fi, be sure to ask about this before you book. They have... More",1
"I spent the weekend at the Hampton Inn in Gloucester, Va and the entire experience was perfect! The staff was helpful and friendly, housekeeping did a great job and the breakfast staff was great. I couldn't have asked for a better stay!Thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are delighted that your stay was so pleasant. Looking forward to your return!",1
"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful.",1
"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy.",0
"The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year.",1
Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future,1
Bathroom disproportionately small compared to the rest of the room Hot breakfast of scrambled eggs and patties left a lot to be desired The theme park shuttle service was a disappointment only a handful of departures a day at not at all convenient times. We only took the shuttle once had to use Uber the rest of the time which was a pity cos I booked this hotel based on the free shuttle service to theme parks marketing Beds were huge and comfy Very friendly and helpful staff Location was good for access to Disney theme parks,1
"Very centrally located for shopping and tourism. Clean rooms, fabulous guest extras and friendly staff.",1
"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
When I arrived at the hotel the service I received from Shannon at the front desk was absolutely amazing.. She helped me take my luggage upstairs without any hesitation. She later called my room to make sure everything was acceptable to my needs and then she was back in the morning to help me all over again.. The kind of... More,1
Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.,1
"Got a great Name your price deal on this hotel. The staff was great (and funny!). It was about 8 miles from downtown, but it worked for us. Breakfast was very good, although they ran out of coffee at times. Very clean rooms and very comfortable. Would definitely stay again.",1
"The hotel sits nicely high on a hill off the interstate overlooking the mountains. It's one of only 2 commercially known hotels in Bedford that I saw (the other was a Fairfield Inn). It was a bit pricy for a Hampton but the room was very nice. Our room had two windows facing the mountains, king bed, couch, 2 chairs,... More",1
"We stayed for one night. We went to the Fox theatre. It was hidden just a little bit near the Metro, so you must be aware and looking for it. The employees were very nice and the breakfast buffet was very clean. The doors in the bathroom in our room,the paint was scraped off and the floors were not the... More",1
"Stayed four nights with hubby for a work conference. I didn't find the convention area to be as much of a trek as in other Vegas hotels. Rooms were spacious, upgraded for 30/night to get a strip view on the 31st floor. We appreciated the security posted near the guest elevators. Dealers were friendly in the casino and staff at... More",1
Good: Location.,1
We were in Fostoria for a class reunion and stayed at this hotel. We had been there before and liked it. It is convenient and met all of our needs. The breakfast buffet was good. We did not make use of the other amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable.,1
We couldn't have made a better choice. The Westin was the full package and provided more than we could have hoped for. Many thanks goes to Sarah Locke for doing such an amazing job with the planning and time that went into our wedding reception. We highly recommend!,1
The two bedroom unit it wonderful for traveling with others. You have your privacy but still in the same unit. The property is well kept and the staff friendly. Location is great for anything in the Lexington area especially the Horse Park.,1
"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing.",1
Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute.,1
"We stayed at the Alpine for 2 nights and the price was very reasonable! They do not provide shampoo or a coffee maker but the rooms are super clean, it is quiet and the rooms are huge. This is a budget no frills motel but you can't beat the price for a clean place to sleep. Towels are small and... More",1
The carpet was dirty. Coffee in the morning was cold. Chain lock on the door was gone. Reserved it for three adults. Only two towels and no blankets or sheets for sofa bed.,0
"Very clean room. Good breakfast. Extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff. The swimming pool is tiny and outdoors, but we didn't use it anyway. This is the best hotel in Jackson TN. We will stay here again.",1
"I have had the privilege of staying at the Fireside Motel on many occasions through the last twenty years and it remains my favorite beachfront hotel in the world. It is not a typical tropical beachfront but a rocky, fierce, wild ocean beachfront. Your balcony will be just a few feet from the waves crashing on the rocks with a... More",1
The mission of Hampton Inn clearly puts the customer as its number one by the evidence of how clean the room is and the friendliness of the staff assuring total satisfaction true to its company mission. Russ,1
"I took a birthday trip with my family, and everything was perfect. I'm so glad I was able to find such a nice room at such a late notice.",1
"We stayed here for 4 nights while enjoying Washington DC. I had read other reviews of Mid Points before booking so I think I had a realistic expectation. I have to agree with most of the reviews the service was outstanding, the breakfast was awesome and the fitness center was clean and spacious. The website does show a pool, however it does not exist so we brought our suits for nothing. Our room was clean, updated and repaired, but the evidence of previous extensive water damage could still be noticed. It isn't in the greatest part of town, but not as bad as Minnesota Ave. The biggest plus for us was the free shuttle to the Metro station which saved me a ton!",1
"We stayed in a Signature Plus room at Best Western for 379 or something ridiculous like that. I wanted an unobstructed view of the red rocks when waking up and falling asleep. I also wanted to be steps away from Uptown Sedona. Our desires for great view and great location were well met with a luxurious suite, quiet, and privacy.... More",1
Great location. We had always stayed in Pigeon Forge and traveled to Gatlinburg. We decided to stay in Gatlinburg and walk to the sights. What a great time we had. This hotel is located a block from the Aquarium and within walking distance to EVERYTHING! We will definitely stay again :-),1
"Staying on El Camino can be noisy, but this motel had many rooms that are away from traffic. Ask for a quiet room. Property was clean and, well, comfortable. Breakfast was better than others I've had at similar properties. This was my first time here, and I'll return.",1
"Bad: Nothing (little far from strip). Good: Kind people, clean space and cheap price",1
My stay here was excellent!! Clean rooms great staff. The best part of my stay was Cynthia. She is such a go get her. She will help you with anything you need. Made me feel right at home. That's the kind of service I expect when I stay at any hotel. Thanks again.,1
Great place ... walking distance from the city center .. and all the shops and eateries there ... would recommend it and plan to stay there again .... parking is also not an issue ... good experience ...,1
Bad: Bathroom doors. Good: Lovely room. Good size.,1
"Fantastic family accommodations!!! The good - Staff was great! Welcoming, friendly and very accomodating. Beds were very comfortable. Except for the very springy pull out couch. Bathroom was very clean. Location was superb!! Overall it was fantastic for the rate. Tons of room for all of us. The not so good- The overall cleanliness was good, except the walls. They... More",1
"We stayed here as part of our road trip and found it to have nice rooms and views, both from the pool area and room balcony. Think we saw more whales feeding from the pool area than on the boat trip from Monterrey. A little odd for us was the lack of a bar and room service only for drinks.... More",1
"Had a king room--asked for one not facing the indoor pool. They gave me one that didn't, but it was across the hall from one of the floor entrance doors (a heavy fire door that made a loud noise when it closed) as well as the ice machine. My room was superficially clean. The dust ruffle had dirt marks on... More",1

Comfortable, intimate, relaxing, organized bed and breakfast,The blending of two new families from different parts of the US in the most gorgeous setting. Denise and Keith made me feel at home. Can't thank them enough! MarJean T.",1
"We enjoyed the hotel very much, particularly the free shuttle to/from the airport and metro station and to drop us at a restaurant for dinner. The complimentary afternoon reception and complete breakfast were excellent and enhanced an at-home atmosphere. The rooms were clean and roomy. We would stay here again.",1
"Stayed at this Courtyard by Marriott for business. The room was clean and spacious. Floor plan was typical for Marriott, I could appreciate the air conditioning unit was not close to the bed. Check-in was seamless. I did not encounter the staff otherwise.",1
"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1
It was ok. I came back because i used the hotel Last year for the same tournament. Rate was good. But I missed my first round because the wake up call did not go through. When you hit the button for the wake up call an automated voice just says Thank you for your wakeup call I called the front desk and set the call but it never came through. Also requested a taxi and it never showed up,1
"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!",1
Amazing red rock views -- especially at sunset! Right in the heart of downtown Sedona -- everything is within walking distance! They also have condos that will accommodate families. Walk down to the creek at the back of the property! The views and sounds are very calming! Can't say enough good things about Sedona in general!!!,1
As an adult couple it was a little overwhelming to have a hotel filled with young people there for a competition. It was nearly impossible to take advantage of the breakfast service. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.,1
This was an RR retreat for me and I enjoyed the peace and quiet and relaxing at Starbucks.,1
"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance.",1
Bad: Lots of chlorine in the pool area. Good: I really enjoyed my stay there,1
"This was such a beautiful, clean hotel. A fantastic location with great staff. Our first night was very loud, so they happily moved us to a different room the next morning. The little coffee/snack bar on each floor was such a nice touch - made it easy and convenient to grab a coffee or water. Plus, the decorating was on... More",1
Good: I loved everything,1
We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was great and we definitely appreciated the hotel shuttle service to near by attractions and resturants. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,1
Good: Nice breakfast with 5 bottomless mimosas. Very nice and helpful staff. Loved the option to forego room service and get a 5 voucher for use at the hotel. Bed and bedding was very comfortable. The ice cold cucumber and berry water in the lobby was always a welcome sight after returning to the hotel.,1
"We had a wonderful time. We planned this stay as a Christmas gift to our children, 7 and 8 yr olds tk watch their first Colts game.I was so happy to not have to walk outside to get to the stadium s ok we didn't have to pack their winter coats all day. We had dinner right down stairs at TGI Fridays and walked to the mall the night before.parking was easy and worth the money to know that my car was ok until after the game. We will definitely be staying again for games and just family time.",1
Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.,1
"The staff was very helpful and even upgraded my room for free. They allow pets, they have hot free continental breakfast and the room was clean and comfortable. My only complaints was the noise of the other guest. You could clearly hear voices and televisions until late and there was a lot of people walking around outside the door of the room.",1
"The room was clean but the refrigerator was very loud so loud that it woke us up. When I contacted the staff, they came to the room but since I had out , so left a note to get contact them. My expectation was they would take care of this issue while I was out of the room. Since this did not happen, at 1:30 am, I just unplugged the refrigerator so we could all sleep.",1
"I am traveling across the country, to California, with my daughter from Omaha NE and was completely exhausted by the time I had reached the Ramada Inn.

"The room was old, dirty, run down. The rig was filthy. The drapes were torn. I would never stay there again.",0
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is only about 10 miles from the oceanfront. The hotel offers many more amenities than anyone could get on the oceanfront for this price!,1
We always stay at this Hampton on our way down to Florida. It is always clean and well maintained. The staff is always courteous and friendly. It is located right off Interstate 95 and very convenient. We make this stop 3-4 times a year. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.,1
"This is a small very clean motel, just what you need to stay for the night without the frills. Steve was helpful, and you can walk to stores and restaurants. There were not many other travelers, so cannot comment on the noise as other reviews mentioned.",1
"I stay at the London every few months, when I come in for business and it always feels like more of a vacation. To the rooms, service, staff, food everything is always four star!! My husband was sick and they had the hotel dr call and got us meds from pharmacy. They did everything in their power to make his... More",1
"I booked this stay with my mother, sister and niece. The hotel was in a great location and close to many conveniences. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. The free Laundromat was also a huge plus. As our visit was for 10 days, the kitchenette in the room proved very convenient and we were also happy to notice that the hotel was not noisy. My only negative was that the hotel windows could not open and sometimes it proved difficult to get the air conditioning at a comfortable setting. Overall a great stay!",1
"Stayed there just for a weekend trip for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price! The breakfast in the morning was good for a hotel and for being included with plenty of options to choose from. The rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable. All in all, I would definitely stay here... More",1
"Looks like a higher priced, well appointed hotel room. Clean, roomy, and modern. Walking distance to the Outback Steakhouse. Wireless internet was fast. Nice breakfast. Room was quiet. I would recommend this, especially to business travellers.",1
"The woman who checked us in upon our arrival was incredibly rude and immediately put a damper on stay. I'm not sure if we were given a handicapped room or if they are all similar, but the bathroom didn't have a tub and was absolutely disgusting. It was one big room with a drain in the floor and did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. One corner appeared to have blood. At 5 a.m. A group of workers with coolers stood at the end of the other hallway from us and we're speaking so loudly for over 10 minutes it woke up my husband, my infant, and I. As my in laws have recently moved to the area I expect we will be visiting Tracy frequently but I will NEVER again stay at this hotel.",0
"This will always be our travel destination to and from Colorado. Clean, comfortable, and reasonable rates.Thank you for making the Ellis Days Inn your choice overnight stay! We appreciate your comments and look forward to your next stay. Be sure to follow us on our facebook page, Days Inn of Ellis.",1
"I have stayed at this hotel many times and the service is always excellent and the property is well keep. I am concerned about security whenever I travel. This property has twenty four hour security and the location is perfect for those who want access to Dallas, Grand Praire, Arlington or Fort Worth",1
"Great location to the beach and boardwalk. Nice to have a kitchen. Would have liked to have stayed for a few more days. Try to get an inside room. Though we did have a slice of the ocean view, the lights of the business on the other side of the alley was on all night.",1
Bad: N/a. Good: Everything good,1
The room was clean. The pool was a little small and lots of people were using it when we stayed. The desk employees were very nice. The hotel is a little bit older but still worth the stay. We were pleased.,1
Hotel was very cozy . Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was small but very pleasant and comfortable Stairs to get up to the lobby were steep . But definitely would recommend this hotel to my friends and would come back for another stay .,1
It was our first time staying at the Honua Kai...We were there for a week....I had my girlfriend and her 84 yo blind grandmother with me...We stayed in a 2 bedroom/bathroom suite (147) on the bottom floor...The suite was well stocked and had high end Bosch Appliances....Be aware that full housekeeping is only every 4th day and trash and towels...

"this is the place to stay if you need a room at the base of the mountain,and want to spend a few days visiting the mountains .The free breakfast may make you want to have a nap they have lots of good stuff to eat . Its a good hotel and location for the price",1
"Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities",1
"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows.",1
"If I can I stay here when I come to town. Prices are reasonable, staff is kind and attentive, breakfast is hot and options are nice (especially fresh fruit) and there is ample sitting room. The Hampton has a nice location off the main street (320th) but close to anything you may need (gas, shopping, Starbucks and lots of restaurants).... More",1
Great hotel for the dog owners. The staff changed our room from a handicap room to another room based on our requirements and I thank the staff for honoring our request and needs.Thank you very much.,1
"The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up.",1
"The hotel made a mistake when I called for a handicap room. The room we had to settle for had one king bed instead of two beds as requested as this was the only handicap room available. The manager arranged to have a cot brought in, which we agreed to. However, we decided not to stay the second night. I... More",1
"Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again.",1
"I know this is an old building. The rooms are not sound proof. I heard very clearly the conversation the mother was having with her children in the next room. The shower did not get hot, warm enough, but not hot.",0
"This hotel was very nice - I had read some of the reviews previously - and was a bit leery to stay here - boy was I wrong! Check in was a slow process - there were a about four people ahead of us, however the line moved quickly. We asked for King upgrade - if they had any and... More",1

"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need.",1
We stayed 3 nights in a room that faced a courtyard. There are no elevators so we were very appreciative of the help with our heavy suitcases up the stairs. The staff at this hotel were accommodating and very helpful. On our first night we encountered a 6 inch centipede in our room. The staff tried to catch the critter... More,1
"The staff was really friendly and helpfull The loccation of the hotel is great cause its only two blocks from central park , two blocks from the subway and within walking distance from cafes and restaurants The building is really old and uncleen and needs reinovation NOW ! The kitchen and everything in it was too dirty to use Wifi was available only at the lobby There was an area to chill like living room on -1 but was too spooky to chill I stayed on the 4th floor , the door of my room was broken and was really difficult to open and close The room and the bathroom were old but clean enough Also the matress and pilow was too small Finaly the heat on the room was too strong and you couldn't control it so you couldn't stay in the room nor sleep",0
Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel.,1
"Hotel was nice and King suite room was large however, sofa sleeper mattress was beyond horrible. Completely worn and not sleep able. Very disappointed in that when traveling with a child. He had to sleep on the sofa instead.",1
"This is an excellent hotel. Not perfect - not amazing, but certainly excellent. I usually frequent Westin Hotels and this one is like a Westin, but nicer. It's certainly worthy of its 4 star rating. The location is good depending on your plans. If you want to do the tourist activities, you're far from the hilly streets, trolley line, wharf,... More",1

"I have been staying here for years and have stayed in every section of the property. It is great for families and singles. The rooms are clean, comfortable and updated. The river views and walkway are relaxing.",1
"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!",1
"The staff here was really great - courteous, helpful, well-informed. The room was comfortable and the kitchenette a real boon. Great value for money. If we're in the area we'd stay there again. Breakfast was nice enough, though a bit more variety would have been nice.",1
Wonderful staff!,1

My girlfriend and I recently stayed the night and it was rad. 19th century Victorian style rooms were great. Old style luxury for affordable rates. The saloon was the best to. Every body was cool.

We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite and it was gorgeous. We were on the second floor in the first tower overlooking the pools and the ocean. It was beyond my expectations.

"This hotel was fine, as airport inns go, but not great. The staff was very friendly, and the shuttle driver was more accommodating than most would have been, so I'd give the staff all five stars.

"Good: excellent hotel in great position, very friendly efficient staff, great on site cooked breakfast, very good dinner menu and excellent evening bar. Well positioned for many restaurants in walking distance. Onsite pool and gym",1
"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon.

"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day.",1

Bad: One complaint. Bath tub too high. Hard to step over. Slipped while trying. Dangerous to short or old people. Not a hotel for anyone with difficulty walking or over 55. Good: Hospitality. Location. Room comfort.,1
"Hotel not well maintained. Lack of staffing. Missing ceiling tiles in hallways, lights out, cleaning staff does only what they have too. No maintenance staff on site. 1st room we had bath fan sounded like it was going to fall apart, room had dirt in corners and behind curtains. 2nd room we had: toilet was loose and rocked, air conditioner had mildew around the sides. Walls in hotel are thin can hear people next door and above. Parking lot not paved.",1

Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!,1
I picked this hotel due to the airport shuttle mostly. The hotel had exterior renovations underway that impacted parking but not the stay. Friendly staff at check in. Then I noticed the nice outdoor pool. Later (after dark) the pool was packed. Lots of people enjoying the area. Very lively. My room was typical Holiday Inn. Upgraded nicely. Just barely... More,1
"The hotel was excellent and the staff were great! The cleaning people and night desk staff were especially nice and helpful, and they even made a dog out of towels once. The room had a small refrigerator which was a nice surprise, and the gym was surprisingly well-stocked with equipment.",1
We also stayed one night due to a cancelled BA flight and after also visiting another room other than the one allocated to us have decided they cannot be the same.

We stayed as a family here one night in the summer and a week in December. Nice place. The breakfast area was always clean and the breakfast area manager was obviously well liked by the repeat business customers as well as us.,1
This Inn is perfect location with amenities that give the comfort I desire. The breakfast is good with many choices. Being able to have my dog with us was a real plus! Local eateries are very good and diverse.,1
"Really enjoyed Aria Resort and Casino. Not too big, not too small. Beautiful rooms, great restaurants and pool. Staff is excellent. Would recommend this venue to my friends and family. The Aria Cafe has the best burgers and loaded tater tots I've ever had.",1

Location was great. Short walk to the ball park. Lobby somewhat clean. Folks were very friendly. I guess you get what you pay for.

"It was mistake.... The hotel itself was not too bad, but the location was bad. Scary neighborhood! I do not recommend this hotel for family. We didn't want to walk around the hotel in night time, so we stayed in the hotel room.",0
"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

We pride ourselves on being able to provide you with a wonderful experience and we are happy to hear that you would return to the property on your future visits to Orange County.I apologize that you experienced a few issues during your stay, but am glad to see that we were able to resolve those during the few days you were visiting with us.

Spent 3 weeks here. Had a great room. Staff is helpful and attentive. Pool was a major asset. Clean and comfortable.,1
Loved having a space that we felt could be our own instead of a motel room. Very clean and everything we needed for cooking. Great location and very pleasant folks to deal with. The fact that we were staying in an historical building made it even more charming.,1
"The hotel has an excellent location, close to several tourist attractions such as Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The staff is really friendly! We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference.

There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs.",1
Frightening. The only good thing about the hotel was the free parking and convenience to the French Quarter. High price for what they provided. Below par for even a budget hotel.,0

"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
This is a beautiful hotel! The staff was excellent and we had an awesome stay. I recommend renting the bikes and riding over the bridge to downtown Long Beach. The evenings with all the fit pits and torches lite are amazing. I will stay again!Thanks for the great review. We love that you loved it. Come back soon.,1
"Very nice room, comfortable bed with good HD TV. Nice amenities and also good if you have children with you. Rooms are quiet and well maintained. It is right off the interstate and short drive to almost everything you could be looking for in San Diego.",1
"Bad: The day shift wouldn't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key. Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes.",1
Wonderful. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Great breakfast and great staff. Rooms clean and comfy. Reasonable rate. Girls had fun I'm the pool. Nice location. Mini mall real close for food and treats,1

I arrived this week for the whole week and I must say this place was a lot better that the Hilton garden inn down the street. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was an ice change from the other hotels I have visited. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here and before I forget the bed mattresses were... More,1
Great hotel! The staff was friendly and very professional. The facility was welcoming and appealing to the eyes. Very clean. You get free cookies in the lobby! (SMILE) My husband and I loved the room: king-sized bed the bathroom had plenty of towels/wash cloths.,1

"I rated low because of the fire alarm that came on at 4:19 in the morning, we needed that sleep because we are expected to perform well at our bowling tournament the next morning.. Our sponsors are not happy with our performance.... We could not get to sleep after that, but we did try, then just when I started to fall asleep again, the alarm came in again at 5:38 (sometime around then )... So since I wasn't offered any compensation,. Not sure if we will return... By the way, your staff is really great!... The food was great, should have opened earlier since the alarms kept everyone up...",0
"Great access to transportation, major tourist attractions, and restaurants. Nearby mall is an added bonus.",1
"We had two nights this month at the Envoy. Upon arrival we were not happy with front desk staff attitude, followed by getting a smoking room despite having booked non-smoking. On return to the desk they could only get us two doubles non-smoking although we were there 15 mins past 3pm and I am a Gold Elite BW member.Parking was good, secure and very handy.Later in the stay we experienced more rude front desk, and saw other guests experience it too.The remainder of hotel staff seemed friendly but spoke little English.Breakfast (included) was fine but they only would put out so much.... even though they had reserves and therefore one had to go very early if one wanted any choice.Location was fine - a block of the boardwalk - but nighttime ventures out showed the neighbourhood to be somewhat rough on the road to bettering maybeAC was ok which was good because it was hot!",1
"Had a wonderful stay here. My fiancee and I came for a weekend getaway. The staff was really helpful, the hotel is immaculate, the spa is a blast, and in the best part of Portland. We will definitely be back.",1
"Stay here as your last option! Oldest motel in Ocean Shores. Not cheap either. My junior suite was 140/night. I think It used to be 2 or 3 different motels that they made into 1 resort.

I was surprised to find a newer Hilton at such a reasonable price. I thought there would be a catch though it turned out it was just a good find. Very nice.,1
"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids.",1
"My Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights . The Staff were very helpful and friendly , quickly acknowledging us by name .

"There with family for 2 day. The hotel was convenient close to dorney park, restaurants and stores, however off a very busy road. The room was very clean, beds comfortable but the room was small for a double room for 4 people. Overall an okay stay .",1
Hotel was easy to and from Hartsfield Jackson airport. Shopping and restaurants you had to travel on the interstate. The room was big and comfortable. Bed was comfortable as well. Bathroom a little small but clean.,1
The communal areas in this hotel are rather shabby but the room and bathroom were OK. This has been the only hotel on my road trip where reception actually called me to check everything is ok which was a nice touch. The hotel is a couple of miles from the resort of Heavenly and right opposite the lake. I would... More,1
"This hotel was amazing and I couldn't stay anywhere else now! I spent a lot of time researching the hotels for my first trip to Las Vegas.

"We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!",1
"I should have checked Trip Advisor before booking on Agoda. I selected for location and price for which I was satisfied. BUT this place is a real treat.

I have been going to Portland for years and I had never even seen this hotel (which has been there for many more years). It is tucked away just a block from busy Exchange St and a few blocks from the waterfront. We pulled into a cobblestone paved circular courtyard and were immediately met by a valet ready to park...

Staff was very friendly. The rooms are dated but roomy. Beds are comfortable. I was very pleased at being acknowledged as being a Choice member. I would like to see more healthy options for breakfast.,1
"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!",0
Good stay!,1
"Great stay with a few minor discomforts The toilet stopped working and they sent up a maintenance worker with a plunger for us. we tried to plunge it but it didn't work. Went to the service desk the next morning but our request for help wasn't recorded and we had to submit another request. Maintenance worker came up and fixed the clog but before anyone fixed it my family had to go to the restroom near the lobby. On another note, Breakfast was great and kitchen staff was welcoming.",1

I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review.

"We really enjoyed our time at the Mills House. We were impressed when walking in and seeing the elegant chandeliers, marble flooring and elegant decor.

The location is great - close to many shops and restaurants and a quick walk down to Waterfront Park and other attractions.",1

Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.",0
"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided.

For the rate it was an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend to my friends!,1
"Overnight business stay. Brand new Hotel. Neat and clean. Friendly staff. This is the 3rd Hyatt Place I have stayed since November, and the concept just works well for me. It was a trudge in the snow to Fells Point, but when warm weather arrives, it will transform into a nice stroll. Will return again",1
The hotel was really nice even if rooms were small and the beds were so cozy it was like being in s best!! The pool was nice and clean and we had no problems getting a beach chair their. The beach was amazing !!! It was clean and had nice white sand!!!!,1
The hotel was average. It's conveniently located close to bwi where they offer a shuttle service to and from the airport (that means no paying to park) hotel staff was so so. Not very friendly. The shuttle driver was cool even at 4am.,1

Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all.

It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August.",1
Great hotel close to BWI Airport. Unexpectedly pleasant stay. Ruby friendly and informative staff. Great Italian restaurant with a short walking distance. Very short shuttle to airport. WILL Absolutely Come again,1
Stayed in a handicapped room where the shower floor needed a good cleaning. Walls are very thin so you can hear all the conversations going on next door.,1
There was a mix up with our room and it was not handled well at all. We returned to change clothes before dinner only to find all of our things had been packed up and were sitting behind the front desk!,0

The room was clean and comfortable - the bed itself could have been better, but then the rates would probably been higher.

Friendly staff and always clean. Recommend having the reception open on Sunday evenings! The breakfast is wonderful wth a chef to cook our omelettes. Very healthy choices. Recommend the fire place in the Reception area and lobby be turned on during winter months.,1
"GORGEOUS hotel. So many beautiful details in every space. The restaurants and bars are great, and there are several cute boutiques as well. Two downsides, the shuttle never seemed to be running and there is no coffee maker in the room.",1
"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me.",1
The room was what you pay for. It reeked of smoke and the Internet was weak and intermittent. The staff was friendly and they have a continental breakfast. Close to the Opry Mills Mall and lots of food options.,0
Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.,1
"I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room).

"Not the quality expected for a Grand Hyatt. Great location to shops, restaurants, beach. Many more children of all ages than expected for this time of year therefore the pool area became less desirable.

We have been coming to the Dunes every fall for more than 10 years. It is a vacation we enjoy more every year. The cottages are like our home away from home. The staff are extremely accommodating. We highly recommend the Dunes!,1
The hotel was fine and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I was just surprised that there was no free newspaper.,1
"This was a beautiful hotel with an indoor pool, very comfortable beds and an extensive breakfast buffet. Each of the employees was friendly and helpful. Will stay here again when we are on our way through.",1
"Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area.",0
"Very pretty hotel. There was Wonderful lady at the check in desk and she handled everything with ease. We had a little bit of an issue but she was so great she didnt make it an issue. The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team. Chef Dana will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed his crawfish and its always nice to hear when the team exceeds all expectations of our guests.We appreciate you staying with us and look forward to always being your hotel of choice in New Orleans.Best regards,",1

"To be short: no wifi (it works only at front desk and pool, lol), no refrigerator, very old TV with bad reception, with non working remote. Very small room, actually too small for 2 beds, very old repainted furniture. Stay away !",0
Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.,0
"Hotel was fine and met needs. Nice amenities in king size room. Room was also a good value for price. Room had nice amenities except it lacked any blankets on bed or available in room. Bed only had a sheet (no comforter or blanket). Many people prefer to keep room cool, but have a blanket to keep warm while sleeping. Excellent breakfast.",1
"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",1
"Hotel was good overall. Good was okay. Desk staff, waitresses and bartenders were great. Would recommend it to a friend",1
"Bad: No bank ATM's...scandalous...not fair. Good: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE WESTIN. This one didn't disappoint either. Location was great, staff was great and facilities were excellent and clean! The view want bad either.",1
"Fullerton is a small community 10 or more miles from the nearest town in any direction. There's not much to do or see here, the roads aren't paved and you could probably fit the entire town into one photo shot. But in the midst of this tiny town, one structure, the Carroll House, seemingly displaced, catches your eye and keeps... More",1
"Booked this hotel as our first stop on our USA roadtrip based on budget so didnt have any expectations on arrival. We drove there from LAX and it was a very easy drive, sat nav got us there in no time. From the second we stepped into the hotel reception area we were greeted by the most welcoming staff ever....

"a hidden jewel. extremely nice, comfy, friendly staff and very clean. not what you would expect when you walk inside. Most definitely staying here again next time i am in okc. the rooftop bar was extremely fun-great drinks, food and atmosphere. walking distance to great restaraunts and not far from brick town, okc memorial.",1
The stay overall was great but the only downfall was the WIFI connection was terrible.,1
Bad: I was supposed to get a room with two beds and ended up with a room with one full bed for me and my husband.it was very small!.,1
"Stopped here on my way back to the west coast. Little did I know, I ran into construction on the off-ramp and the intersection just before the hotel. Not their fault. The lady at the front desk was extremely friendly. Although I saw a few dead bugs in the stairwell at the end of the hallway I would definitely stop... More",1
"Friendly staff, basic rooms. Beds were ok, ventilation in room not good enough. Only AC, not possible to open a window. Breakfast was included, oatmealjuice most healthy stuff to eat. Coffee of pretty good quality. All together price/quality just on par.",1
Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.,1
"Give Robert a raise! We were trying to catch a flight from O'Hare to ATL early in the morning and my girlfriend forgot her phone in the room. Luckily, we called and he managed to get the phone as we made our way back on the provided shuttle bus. Orlando the shuttle driver was quick to pull us into our... More",1
Stayed here after a day visiting the Gulf Coast beaches. It was easy to find with many restaurants and other stores in the area. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The room was spacious and clean. Excellent breakfast. Our only complaint is that the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors.,1
"this hotel happened to be the last one to have rooms for the time me and my friends were down there! Talk about a nasty rundown place, first off we walked in our room and the sheets and bed looked unfit to sleep on, the smell was nasty and we had to let our room air out, when we went... More",0
"Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Hotel is old, in need of updating - especially the carpet, heavily stained. The per night price was too much in comparison to the condition and service for the hotel.",0
I called the manager Matt for two straight weeks and left multiple messages. He felt it was unnecessary to return any of phone calls so my stay was ruined. I would never stay here again.,0
"Kept getting bit by something in the bed,not sure if it was bed bugs or not.",1
"It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!",1
"Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan",1
"Staff were very nice and helpful, set up golf trips, got directions, provided shuttle etc. Clean rooms, nice pool,nice restaurant. hot tub is kind of small and if wanting to swim in ocean a lot, might want to stay on va beach instead of bay, but not very far away if dont mind drive.",1
"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip.",1
"The pictures do this place no justice. IT IS AWESOME! BEAUTIFUL!!! The entire property is immaculate. Room service is twice daily, plus turn down service with chocolates, motivational quotes and slippers. All employees were extremely nice and helpful. Elevators were quick and efficient l. Ammenties...EVERYTHING! You have to try the turkey burger and lemonade at the burger shack. You won't... More",1
"Bad: Breakfast was slim pickings. No cereal or toast. No yoghurt. Only bagels with unrefrigerated cream cheese and quick oats porridge. Don't go for the breakfast. Good: Great room, clean and a comfortable.",1
"For our wedding we rented the king balcony suite. The room was spacious and perfect for getting ready. The large bathroom, bedroom, and living room allowed for multiple people to get ready and for my wife and I to not see each other as we were both getting ready. The bar had excellent cocktails and the in-room coffee was good... More",1
I am a Hilton Diamond member and this is one of the best Hamptons I have stayed in for quite some time. The staff was wonderful and the hotel was very comfortable and not run down. The breakfast was plentiful and there was a good variety of items to choose from.,1
For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.,1
Booked for overnight stay prior to cruise. Arrived at hotel around 2PM amid lots of ongoing confusion with other guests in the lobby. When our turn came we were told our room was not ready with no real specifics as to when it would be. Was told we could go around to shopping areas while waiting. Decided to wait in... More,0
Nice location about 3 blocks from Busch Stadium and 2 blocks from a entertainment center. Parking was kitty-corner to the hotel and is discounted from normal parking for a game. I met my brother there before the game. Room was clean and had view of Arch and the river. Breakfast buffet that was included was above average. Nice variety and... More,1
"This was adequate for our short Christmas season get-a-way and met our needs very well. Breakfast is somewhat limited, but we were satisfied. We did our sightseeing in Jefferson, Texas and this was the closest Best Western.",1
"I was nicely greated as I entered the lobbie. while checking in they had my packet ready which included may of area, coupons and suggestions of activities. Very friendly staff throughout my stay.",1
"I usually try to stay at a full Marriott or a Courtyard, however, there are none within 20 miles of here. I was hesitant to stay at a Fairfield, fearing a holiday inn express or comfort inn type stay. I am happy to report that this hotel is very clean and convenient. The staff was very nice and my room... More",1
This is by far the Best La Quinta we have ever stayed in. Everything was new and up to date. Extremely CLEAN!!!! Very nice friendly staff. This one actually served a hot breakfast besides to token waffle. Loved the stay.,1
Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.,0
The Aria was by far one of the best places that I have stayed in Vegas. The rooms were amazing completely controlled by a computer tablet. Never seen anything like it. You walk into the room and it comes alive. The curtains open the TV comes on and plays music. Awesome!,1
We will return. It was just wonderful. Customer service was very much on point.,1
Good: service was prompt and friendly.,1
Passing through Tn. And had to stop somewhere for the night. It was part of the choice hotel deal so we thought maybe the rooms are nicer on the inside than the outside since they spent a small fortune on advertising billboards. The room was absolutely depressing. Desperate need of updating. Walls were cracked and dirty. The bathroom had fixtures... More,0
"We spent one night here after a day on Lake Billy Chinook. We had a lot of room to park our truck and boat away from the highway, as did others. Our room was on the third floor, with a king bed and small sofa. Boy, was the beautiful room inviting!! It was equipped with a coffee maker, small frig,... More",1
"Good: Great location, quiet rooms, wonderful staff. Was a real pleasure to stay there.",1
"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking.",1
Loved the steam shower! Luxurious!,1
"Bad: Nothing much. Good: Modern, Soft beds, Great atmosphere",1
We came to Warner Robins with our team for the State Wrestling Tournament and enjoyed our weekend trip due to this lovely place! Machonda was very sweet and gave us directions to the nearest ATM. The room was nice and I love that we were given the option of fluffy or firm pillows!!,1
"This hotel is comfortable and the staff were friendly. Rooms were clean with Matrix hair products. The breakfast was a bit disaapointing, but the muffins were excellent. Room 118 is right off the breakfast area and if you want something a bit quieter, select another room. Close to amenities!",1
Received excellent service from the front desk to the hostess in the breakfast area. Friendly staff. The room was very comfortable. Had a king non-smoking and it was great. Received an upgrade to a suite for the price of regular room.,1
"The personnel at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The room was a whole lot better than I was expecting. The bathroom was a bit tight, the shower/tub was a good size tho.",1
"The bed was broken but was still comfortable, just a bit sunken in. The floor was a bit dirty but overall everything was good.",1
"Overall a nice place to stay a night or two on your way. Clean rooms, older exterior but considering the rate paid, a good value.",1
"We enjoyed our stay a this property, all staff including Housekeeping were very friendly and helpful. Having the continental breakfast was an added bonus for us. The bed was comfortable, the Hotel and rooms were clean and staff was great and very attentive. The only thing for us was the street noise, even being on the 9th floor. The view... More",1
"This was my third time at Aria Resort and it didn't disappoint. The only criticism I have is the queue to check in, i could see they are installing Express check in machines but i dont think they were in use yet. We were given a room in 26th floor. As expected, it was clean, spacious and had all mod... More",1
"The Galt House is in a perfect location. It's within walking distance of restaurants, pubs, museums, and shopping. It also has great views of the Ohio River and 4th Street. However, the rooms are in need of updating. The airconditioner and plumbing made noises all night. I stay here frequently and some changes have been made but much more needs... More",1
"Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again.",1
We have stayed at this motel several times traveling down to Florida and returning north. We were pleased to see the mgmt. is finally putting some effort in the upgrading the rooms. Rooms are small and using my computer was not easy. No convenient electric outlet. WiFi was slow. It was also cramped in the room trying to use the... More,1
"Probably as perfect hotel as you are likely to find. Latest updates, friendly staff. Clean room and bathroom!",1
"Our stay was great we have stayed there a few times and loved it each time. The staff is very nice and helpful, the rooms are always very clean and comfortable. Really enjoyed the indoor pool and the breakfast.",1
"Overall great stay, rooms are small but cozy ... great fire place near bar to sit and drink wine. Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer. It was a very bad experience and significantly delayed our travel to Lake Tahoe while trying to figure out what to do with extra luggage.",1
Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!,1
"The air conditioner in my room was very noisy, kept me up, had to trun it off and open windows. That let in the light and street noise (which was quieter than air condioner). Bathtub drain plug was broken so I had to tak a shower whch I don't like to do. No shampoo or conditioner.",1
no hubo agua caliente ninguna de las 3 noches que nos hospedamos. Nos quejamos reiteradamente con el gerente y no brindo ninguna solucion.,0
"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.",1
"Everything was great, staff is wonderful, Misha at front desk was so helpful! So glad I picked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon! Evan (Misha's biggest fan)",1
"This is a condo resort. We rented a studio, which meant that the bedroom, living area and kitchen were all in one. That suited us fine. The lanai was adequate for us. There are two what appear to be identical buildings. The first night, after dinner at Dukes (on the property) we walked back to what we thought was our... More",1
"This was a beautiful place for a small wedding. The gazebo frames the mountains, and the view is spectacular. One of the owners was very accommodating about questions and pre-wedding visits. It was an excellent experience except for one thing which is why I do not give it 5 stars. One is required to rent the four rooms for at... More",1
"I don't normally write bad reviews unless I was extremely unhappy with the experience hence this rating. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The previous guest had left the toilet clogged and the hotel never bothered to unclog and clean it. When we arrived at the room and notified the front desk, the maintenance guy blamed it... More",0
From the front desk to the room and next day breakfast this place is first class. It is crowded due to being the homebase of Cox Cable employees - so book ahead! Just off 680 on the west side - you can get to anywhere in Omaha from here quick.,1
"The hotel is beautiful, clean and in a great location. The bathrooms need to be larger but that is my only complaint.",1
"We were there because of the loss of a love one therefore, we did not spend much time in the room. It was a place to sleep. It was small yet comfortable.",1
Location is very important. this was on the door step to ever think! Beach. Shops. and FOOD! Mmm love food x there so much to say about this places unsure were to start. The staff were fabulous.the rooms were spotless could not fault then at all. I meet some Lovely people from all over the world. we sat and chatted... More,1
"I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room, which was very dated. The staff was super friendly, and I appreciated that. The breakfast area was crowded, and being on of the first rooms in the hotel, it seemed everybody wanted to walk by having a conversation at full volume while I was trying to sleep.",1
The motel has a pool and exercise room. The breakfast bar was 1st class. Everyone that I had any dealings with were top notch.,1
"This hotel puts Reading, PA back in the map. Great place to stay to celebrate, wedding, reunion, honeymoon, etc. Restaurant and Bar are excellent, breakfast is always scrumptious. The staff are very friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable. Lots of parking (garage).Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate your comments. It was our pleasure having you as our guest.",1
"Old building, the door didnt close properly you could see the light of the hallway through the side of the door, there was a love cockroach in the bed our first night.",0

Bad: In-room AC unit was noisy - Tall tower standing in the corner near the window.,1
"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!",0
"Amazing staff and awesome accommodations!!! I'd visit Colorado just to spend the night here! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to enjoy a good nights sleep, top notch Staff. Extremely nice and friendly!",1
"The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and well maintained. I did find a couple of ladybugs near the window, but nothing to worry about. The TV even had a sleep timer. Love that feature.",1
"We've stayed at the SpringHill Suites several times over the past year. Most importantly to me the property is clean. In addition, the staff (especially Heather at the front desk) is helpful and always smiling. We had a few issues during our stay room cleaning was overlooked and no bottled water in our room. With a quick call to the... More",1

However, the battery in our car died when we got there and so i called the very helpful man working overnight and got... More",0
"We stayed 1 night in a smoker room, we don't smoke but this was the only option I could select. The room was pretty dated but still seemed clean. Outaide stairs to get up to our room were a little rickety. Pool/game room area was very neat! Breakfast was good. Staff very polite and friendly. They even gave us a little bag with a few treats and bottle water when we arrived so that was nice too! Would stay there again.",1
The hotel was clean but the service personnel leave much to be desired. They were not as helpful as you would expect. They could anser simple questions and some even had attitudes.,1
I was a little worried from the outside and the lobby but I was very happy with the room. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. The proximity to everything I wanted to do was good. I would stay again.,1
Rigtig godt hotel Super sdt personale Ca15min fra stranden,1
"The staff were so helpful, the breakfast was delicious, and the beds were very comfortable!",1
"Staff was friendly and place was clean and very nice. Only issues that we had was the windows were a bit drafty, not sealing very well and most of the TV channels went out in the evening and didn't come back up until the time we left. I inquired several times at the front desk and they said they were working on it. I understand the weather was not good and may have affected it but not for as long as it was. Other than that, the stay was really really nice and comfortable.",1
it was terrible.it was dirty.the bathroom was not clean.,0
"Bad: check-in line was slow. Good: Parking was very convenient, partly because we drove a hybrid and they had special spaces reserved for hybrids.",1
"Bad: Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed, but we needed some supplies). It's OK, not a big deal. Good: Great location to visit Boston. Room was spacious and modern. Overall staff was professional and friendly.",1
I had to be in LA shortly for some business but wanted to combine it with pleasure since the misses was tagging along. I normally stay at a different hotel when in LA but this one popped up and it had good reviews so I was like why not. I have to say up front that when it comes to... More,1
"We were passing through Erie for one night on our family vacation. This hotel served its purpose just fine. It is advertised as new, though it looks a little too worn to be new - shade on the window was frayed and out of its track (I fixed it myself), stained and molded grout around the shower in our room... More",1
Bad: I needed directions on how to work the shower -took forever to figure out how to get hot water. Good: Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that you didn't have to fight to get into the hotel from the street. Couldn't hear street noise. Comfortable room and great staff.,1
The room was clean and quiet even with the freeway right across the street. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about. It has an indoor heated pool but it must of been heated by the moon because we didn't feel the heat only from the jacuzzi. Other than a cool pool we had a great trip.,1
"Past reviews made me skeptical, however, I was quite satisfied with my stay. The staff, room, and service was friendly, clean and professional - and this was during spring break! I will stay here again on my next trip to the area.",1
We wanted to take an opportunity of the perfect riding weather and decided to book rooms here. We rode from Dillard through Highlands to Cashiers. What a beautiful ride! Our route brought us right to this Comfort Inn. We checked in and took the elevator to the 4th floor. Our room was very clean and had a great view of... More,1
The suite was nice and you could see Busch Gardens from the room. The only downer was the pull out bed needed replaced badly. I pulled the mattress and slept on the floor. Still a good value. The continental breakfast was better than most. Ant eh staff is very friendly and helpful. I plan to stay there again next time... More,1
Good: Everything was great!!,1
Stay in the Blue Room. It was really cute. The Inn was located right in town so we were able to walk everywhere. The cutest little lady owns the place. We had stawberry shortcake for breakfast and spent the whole time at the beach. the price was very reasonable as well. The owner even let us borrow her beach chairs. We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE.,1
"Everything was great, until I woke up to get a drink from the fridge. I turned on the light to find roaches running around in the kitchenette. Very upset.",1
"Clean, nice staff and wonderful pool. Great location, but because of that it's pretty noisy. The decor was not my fave, but that's not a big deal. There were little things off like no mini fridge or fan in the bathroom.Thank you for your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve our property.",1
"Having stayed many times at the Riverside Inn and enjoyed it, we recently stayed again and found the rooms newly decorated and a very fresh look. It is such a treat to sit out on the good sized deck and enjoy watching the wildlife on the river or have a picnic on a warm night. It is a very good... More",1
Everything at this hotel was great we had a great time it was clean the people are nice everything was good so going back to Maine I would definitely stay here and that would let everybody know to stay here,1
The location of the hotel is perfect and we were able to walk to places like Caf DuMonde and Bourbon Street. There were several shops and restaurants within walking distance as well. Very clean hotel with a very attentive and courteous staff.,1
"We could easily hear steps from the room above us, we were on the second floor, so I had to call like twice at the front desk to complain about the noises on the room above. Close to the theme parks, free parking lot, good breakfast.",1
Nice and clean compared to allot of places out here. Great staff.. Next time we come out here we will stay here.. The bathrooms were very clean and the rooms were not too hot or too cold. Like I said will stay there from now on..,1
I was happy considering I used to live in Flint and I'm wary about the hotels there. Everything was clean and in good condition. Shower was hot and staff was nice. Area is very convenient.,1

We had a block of standard two-bed rooms, as well as some beautiful one bedroom suites. The service was impeccable and there was great attention to detail across... More",1
Comfortable beautiful historic hotel in the heart of this part of the city. Walkable to great restaurants and shops. Great place to stay and will stay again!,1
Very nice hotel and great staff,1
"I WANTED to love The King Charles Inn because I LOVE Charleston so much. We visit often. We usually stay at the Doubletree Marketplace because we are being cheap, or for a splurge, at Charleston Place, in my opinion, the best place if you don't mind spending money. It's pointless to spend a lot, cause who lingers in their room... More",0
I chose this place due to the trip advisor reviews and I can agree that it is a great little place. I was travelling by myself for work and I was immediately made very welcome. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfortable. Every evening the staff put out some wine and nibbles from 5-7pm. I... More,1
I stayed and was almost eaten alive by bed bugs - Cost 118 doctor visit and ruined my vacation- reported to local health authority but received a reply back that since bedbugs are not known to transmit diseases and there are no public health laws addressing requirements for their control and removal they would not investigate or require action. I... More,0
"Great location on the beach, but rooms are really tiny, especially the bathroom. The free wireless internet is useless, as in our three day stay, the signal was too week to access, not even once - despite our room's nearness to the management office. No excuse for that.",1
"My overall experience at Hampton Inn in Dodge City, ks was excellent. The staff is very professional and courteous. The accommodations were excellent. The atmosphere is pleasant for all ages. The room was spacious and great for relaxing. Breakfast was delicious.",1
My stay was OK but could have been much better if the hotel was pet friendly. The maid didn't speak English so couldn't understand any requests for normal room amenities.,1
First time here and it will definitely not be my last. This hotel is beautiful. Had the 2 bedroom suite and it was awesome. Love Everything about it. You cannot go wrong with this hotel.,1
"The Aria was great. Great food and drink. Carbone was delish, a bit overpriced. Amenities at Aria the best. Life was exciting after dark in the casino. Loved the atmosphere. Will be coming back real soon",1
"Good: Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well. Location to TD Garden and restaurants awesome.",1
"Very clean, good service, nice amenities, beautiful decor. I've stayed here twice for conferences and will go back if I have a chance. Incredible suites! No complaints! And the downtown Louisville area has some great food fairly close to the hotel.",1
"Wow, was this my weekend to completely strike out on the higher end hotel scene. First, the good. The staff of Millennium is first rate. The property is well staffed, well dressed, professional and courteous. And waaaay out of place. The Millennium is a four star, but the star scale appears to have increased to ten or twelve. I took... More",0
"Comfortable, clean, and quite. The gentleman at the front desk phoned after my wife and I were in the room for a few minutes to make certain we had no problems and were happy with the room. Friendly people. Great bed. Excellent breakfast. Have a pool but didn't use it. The hotel is not downtown so the room is quiet.... More",1
"We traveled to Tarpon Springs for two reasons: three business meetings and a dear friend's 75th birthday celebration. The hotel staff members were very nice and helpful. The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations! We will definitely consider staying there for future business and personal trips to Tarpon.",1
"This is the to go place for one of my biggest clients in Kenedy, TX. Great service and great management, I work with Sandra the hotel manager the hotel on daily bases and she provides an excellent customer service. Way to go fieldhouse Inn.",1
"We close on our house downtown, and needed a place to stay after the move. I really didn't have that much time at the hotel,because I was in late, and out early. My wife had more time, and really enjoyed it. I wish they served coffee before 6:30",1
Not operational when we went by. Looks very run down and overgrown with vegetation. So if you are looking for an investment property and a challenge this property would fit the bill. Good luck to the current owners and the new owners.,0
Be afraid be VERY afraid.I'd rather sleep on the ground then thisresort.Upon ariving two young boys came to the unit to collect a 45 cleaning fee.They brought a vacaum cleaner with them to do the floor around me as I signed the paperwork.

"I liked the big, clean room. The deep tub was a plus. Friendly staff, check in was fast. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of pillows and towels. The room was quiet even though there were people in the nearby rooms.",1
we were very pleased to be able to use computer to check in with our airline to save time at the airport.,1
The price was that of a hotel but it was really more like a motel. The hotel was clean and quite. But the cost was the highest I've ever paid at a BW. I did not go to the pool so I'm not sure the quality of the pool. Pillows at a BW could always be better than they are.,1
Was only there to shower before hitting the road back home but the rooms were nice and clean. There were minor flaws such as dings and dents here and there but other than that it was a basic hotel.,1
"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel.",1
"Lovely large rooms,comfortable beds,located very near big Westfield shopping mall. House bar is a bit small and lacks atmosphere would be the only let down. Value for money ,newish hotel in a city where the hotels are old and run down",1
The staff was extremely accommodating whenever we needed. The room was clean and pleasant. The location was within walking distance to several great venues. Not having been in Atlanta before we had a hard time locating the entrance for checking in however.,1
"Our room was very clean, but the bagel for breakfast was very dry. We went there for new years eve and new years day it was real close to Cincinnati we had a blast would definitely go back to this hotel.",1
"Perfect location to get to merriweather, tons of food options across the street. Staff was helpful.",1
"The hotel is crazy outdated with comforters literally dating back to the 1960's (and haven't been washed since). The first room that we checked into had spots of blood on the shower curtain, one wall, and ceiling fan, and a pubic hair perfectly placed on the bathroom towels. I asked the man at the front desk to come with me... More",0
"Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Great location, great service, great staff, great rooms! And they take pets! The front desk staff was very helpful and so courteous. The last time we were in Jackson we stayed at the Marriott Courtyard next door and their service and the attitude of their front desk staff was so terrible we vowed... More",1
"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!",1
"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. We are so ecstatic to hear you enjoyed our fully equipped kitchen in room, morning breakfast spread, and unbeatable location next to the Space Needle. We look forward to hosting you in the future until then, happy travels!Sarah Junge",1
"We booked the hotel for a two night stay. When we entered the hotel room, we were satisfied with space. We were surprised no extra blankets and pillows were in the room for pull out sofa bed. Front desk was polite and provides them, upon request. Breakfast was mediocre, at best. A/C in room was ok. Constantly humid in the... More",0
Room was ready upon check-in and hotel room was very big! Nice clean room with comfortable bed. After a long day of scuba diving it was wonderful to go and relax in the hot tub. Breakfast wasn't very good though. Pool food quality and not very good selections.,1
"The location is excellent. It's right across from EAA and right by the outlet malls. Tons of restaurants within a 5-minute drive. The hotel room itself was bigger than expected and had comfortable beds. Although I didn't use the pool area, it looked nice for kids. The hot breakfast was OK. The thing that knocked it down to 4 stars... More",1
Great overall experience Staff was very friendly. Got a hot cookie when I arrived. Had lunch and breakfast at the restaurant located on the water with a nice view of the Queen Mary. Food and service was excellent.Thanks for the wonderful review and comments. We are so happy you enjoyed the hotel and look forward to your return.,1
Love the value of this hotel as we head to Indy 500 each year.,1
"This property is right off I-90 and US 45. There are quite a few wineries close by, restaurants nearby tooo. Good clean place with good continental breakfast. Front desk staff is excellent. A WSJ is available every morning, except Sunday!",1
Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!,1
"I stayed may and June,enjoyed it so much that we are talking about coming back next year,staff very friendly,food at the buffett very good and reasonable prices,room very clean and nice,enjoyed the pool and hot tub, parking not an issue,plenty of shopping around the hotel no complaints,highly recommend it thanks cathy and sheldon",1
Bad: Rude guest service. Good: I liked the room I was in and was close to other hotels.,1
Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.,1
"I have never stayed at a hotel as dirty as this. The sheets in the windows were ripped, the drain in the shower wouldn't drain, and the mattress was as lumpy as I've ever slept on. The freeway noise was like the trucks were going through your room!",0
"Although the employees were very nice and friendly, and the hotel was clean, I cannot give it more stars because the rooms were tiny and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. Blankets were also thin. Continental breakfast was adequate.",1
"Although this hotel was not off the beach, it was just a small walk down from all major shopping and beach area. Hotel was recently redone and is much nicer than some of the higher priced hotels along beach front. You get to control your a/c. I wish we had stayed here for the entire stay. The neighborhood has great little pubs and small shops and restaurants that you might want to check out as well.",1
"We have now stayed at Honua Kai twice and both times have been fabulous. The resort is set on a gorgeous sandy beach and has fabulous pools. You really do get the best of both worlds.

Good: Clean and nice room with comfortable bed. Really friendly staff. This hotel is my favourite in Miami Beach.,1
"Affordable, clean, comfortable and friendly. Was surprised, for the price I paid to stay. I had expected a whole lot worse. Close to every thing in town. I had hot water and had no problems brushing my teeth. I don't believe it is plastic on the mattresses but is a mattress protector. I have seen the results of bed bugs... More",1
"The hotel was very clean, close to many businesses, and had an excellent staff. Arrived late went in they immediately found reservation check in was about 10 minutes. Beds were very comfortable and the free admission to the indoor waterpark was awesome. I think very highly of this hotel.",1
"Friendly and very accommodating front desk staff and manager. I made an error in my stay dates and the manager was most accommodating. Very close to Trade Days. Clean, quiet room with very comfortable beds.",1
"There was nothing real close to walk to, but a short cab ride to a lot of places.",1
"I felt compelled to write this after reading the other reviews. While this is an older hotel, the place is absolutely wonderful! Rooms were clean, fridge and microwave in room, nice pool area, it has it all! Staff was friendly and most helpful! Lots to do in the area and would definitely stay here again!",1
"Location is great, Hotel is a little old but its clean. I would recommend staying here but don't expect it to be like the Hilton or Sheraton. Staff are very friendly and are always happy to help, Breakfast is included which was nice also",1
Bad: Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms. Good: Free water and apples,1
Good: Staff were all extremely friendly. Hotel was clean.,1
"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",0
"I was always happy with Hyatt Place customer service, except for the one time I stay at the Lithonia location. My first bad experience came from the front desk staff. I came there on a slow Monday afternoon (02/08/2016) first time at 12:30. She didn't let me check in. I came back around 2:00 and she still not letting me... More",0
"We love everything about this place. The location, the history, the unique flora and fauna, funky cool building, great owners (Scott and Cathryn) are like your favorite aunt and uncle.

"Linda the front desk gal was just Awesome, we would recommend this hotel for sure. Food was great for breakfast, our room was clean and the bed comfortable. The service was amazing from Linda at the front desk, to the cleaning ladies, sweet people.Dear Traveler, Thank you for posting a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. I will share this review with Linda and staff. Thank you mentioning Linda, she really enjoys her job. Sincerely, Vickie W.",1
"Overall this Best Western is nicely decorated. It was a bit disappointing that the bathroom did not function. A fairly busy property, so repairs were slow. The plus if you need or want to be close to 101. It is minutes from the freeway. Very convenient, if you are traveling to the Northern California's Redwoods or Sonoma/Napa.",1
"Bad: Arrived at reception late evening - it was in the middle of a very busy bar, couldn't hear receptionist. Got in lift and hadn't been told we needed to swipe room key card to get anywhere! Also had to pay per day for wifi!. Good: Beautiful room, good location",1
This is a nice family owned hotel. It is well appointed but not luxury. The service was exceptional. They could teach a course in hotel service. The staff introduced themselves and remembered our name.,1
"This is a decent motel The staff is very friendly the breakfast is quite sparse compared to some other places at similar prices. Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car.",1
Bad: Little Pricey. Good: Large Room,1
"Called and scheduled a room two months in advance, gave them a card with the expiration and security code to pay for the room so my family who would be travelling without me would be taken care of. When they get there after business hours, they inform my family that they need the card there with them to pay for... More",0
"This hotel is clean, fresh, updated and welcoming. The room was spacious, clean and current. Everything worked well in the room, bed was comfy. A breakfast is included and was very good. The staff are all helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Will definitely be staying here again. One of the best hotels in this price range I... More",1
"We could not have been more impressed with the service, the friendliness, the cleanliness, and the location of the hotel. It is an absolutely stunning hotel right around the corner from Union Square and the Financial District. The staff was very welcoming. We loved the turn-down service and our view from the corner King room on Floor 24 was absolutely... More",1
"I gave this place 2 stars because the carpets were filthy. The kids socks and feet were black after walking on the floors and carpets. Plus we found a clump of hair near the drapes. The problem becomes that you start to wonder what else is dirty that you can't detect. On the flip side, the front desk was very... More",0
Stayed hare for a night as all else was full. Staff was friendly and easy check in. Breakfast was very disappointing. Little choice and not fresh. The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok.,0
"Stay is pleasant however, very expensive and staff no more helpful than in other hotels. We are here for a special occasion, on Checkin hotel asked this - we were hoping for upgrade or something, but nothing! Then other members of group arrived and they were upgraded! Typical, no luck! Location is excellent.",1
"Hip, but not too hip. Staff super friendly and knowledgeable. Absolutely perfect location for walking around Portland. Rooms nicely appointed, if a touch small (few drawers for clothes) big bathrooms. Restaurant solid and bar good too. Really excellent little boutique-feeling hotel.",1
"Im very happy with this hotel, it was very clean,and will stay there again. And will recommend to a friend, and family members. And also, lots of places to go and visit, and see, and friendly staff, and nice lobby",1
This is my 2nd time staying here and I think it's a nice hotel for the price. You can't beat the full breakfast that's included with your stay. That's my favorite part! It's yummy!,1
Room has a gas fire place but pilot light gets blown out by draft. Owner is offsite after hours and has to come relight it. They have four servers for wireless internet but none work in the room we had. We made two calls but they could not resolve it. We stayed in winter. At 7 degrees the cold water... More,1
"I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night.",0
"This property definitely needs renovation. Dirty floors, minimal cable TV, no amenities other than free WiFi (worked fine) and free parking. Everything has been used well (which is not a positive statement). Dirt in corners of room and windows.",0
"My girlfriends and I stayed here for two nights so that we could see a performance at the Majestic theater. The double queen suite was perfect for our needs, with a nice living area with comfy couch, ottoman, chair and big screen TV. The beds and pillows were heavenly! I highly recommend this hotel for sightseeing in downtown San Antonio.",1
"We had reservations at another place but, we did not feel safe nor did it look clean. We had a last ditch effort to call Best Western Plus again to see if there were any vacancies (softball tournament in town). They had a vacancy!! From the moment we called the first time to the time we left, the staff was... More",1
"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan",1
Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view,1
We visited to be close to the theatre and inner harbor. We had a pleasant stay and were close to our planned activities. I would recommend to others.,1
"My room was comfortable and very clean. The staff was very courteous, knowledgeable and exuded enthusiasm in regard to customer service.

Michelle was especially helpful in getting my credit for a night not needed when I finished my training early. I would definitely stay... More",1
"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool. As for room service- the quality was there and the gentleman who brought our food was kind and courteous. We plan to stay again soon.",1
"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"What a wonderful hotel. My sister and I arrived late in the day so the hotel tried to connect with us via phone and email in advance of our arrival to confirm and ensure we had an easy arrival, even though we were arriving after the front desk was closed for the day. They left us all the details we... More",1
"The Quality Inn has friendly, helpful staff that go out of their way to get you what you need. The breakfast is outstanding and with Old Chicago next door lunch and dinner are just as great! Highly recommend Quality Inn St. Cloud!",1
I was bitten by something in the room and when I brought it to the attention of the staff it was minimized by general manager. Poor customer service when initially I wasn't asking for a refund or any compensation. I now will go to the doctor and have them tell them that they are some type of insect bites.,1
"The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am",1
I would have given this hotel 5 stars except my TV and internet went out during a heavy rain storm. The staff was pleasant and when my double room wasn't ready they upgraded my to a king.,1
Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.,1
"My husband and I have been coming back to this hotel yearly since 2004. It's great to see that there are things that have stayed the same at the resort, and many things that have improved. It's clear to see the investments that the resort makes to both keep up and maintain what they have, as well as improve other... More",1
"Lives up to all the previous reviews: large, quiet rooms with great view friendly staff little dated extremely smoky casino older crowd. We stayed for 6 nites. We hit the Strip on a couple of evenings and didn't mind the 20 min drive back to our hotel.",1
"We usually look for Drury Inns when we travel. This location is very convenient off the highway. I liked the out door area by the pool. We had a great suite, highly suggest the suites to families. The mall is across the parking lot and convenient.",1
The entire staff at the Days Inn made us feel welcomed and at home during our recent trip to the area for my son's college regional playoffs!,1
"Have stayed here many times. It is on the South side of the tracks, which is good as you can see the trains but do not hear them as loudly as the north side. This is a 1960's motel, but very clean. Park in front of the room. Nice outdoor pool, close to a lot of restaurants. US 83/277 freeway... More",1

I don't recommend anyone to stay there! Because this is the most awful hotel in Wisconsin Dells! Poor service! Disgusting rooms not clean! Noizy! hole on the walls! Don't visit this hotel! NEver ever ever,0
"This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay.",1
Bad: Cost of the valet. Good: Location to the garden,1
"If I wanted to be nitpicky, there might be some stuff to improve. But I am not and we were very pleased with our room, especially for the Priceline special price we paid. It was large and roomy and great for me and 2 energetic older kids. We had many tv channels to choose from, including 2 Showtime channels. I... More",1
"Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided. Dear Traveler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on behalf of your stay with. We apologize that some of the renovations were taking place during your stay. It is through your feedback that we are able to improve what we do. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.",1
"I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit. We take very seriously any complaints of discrimination, any forms of which are not tolerated in our company. As the hotels General Manager, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue with you, and also address and clarify your concerns regarding pool usage and rooftop access.

"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a family trip. Good stay, breakfast wasn't great, pool needs a major cleaning room was really muggy, there was construction everywhere around that area but we were able to get around fine. Not far from bricktown which is where we spent most of our time. Good for a quick stay but I wouldn't prefer to stay for more than a day.",1

"My family had an amazing experience. We arrived early and staff had a room ready for us. The walk to the tram is very short.. breakfast was good but would preffered scramble eggs and potatoes. The only problem was the parking, but staff made it easy to find one for us. Thanks for all the help!!!",1
"The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location.",1
"Our priority hotel is Hampton because it has been in the past clean and the bedding is claimed to be laundered after each guest. The Hampton in Lake Mary , Florida was not up to standard. The bathroom floor was filthy.",0
Good except there was only a breakfast buffet on Saturday morning.,1
Perfect accommodations with friendly service at a great value. We are frequent guests at various Hilton Gardens and have never been disappointed. The whirlpool suites are worth the extra money. We also splurge on the breakfast package the omelets are wonderful.,1
Very clean room and comfortable bed. Was disappointed that we did not have a river view room and/or a balcony. There was supposed to be a stream outside the back door of our room but very little water was trickling through it. We did have a fireplace and where our room was situated was very quiet.

I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.,1

"Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg",1
"Pretty good stay, staff was a bit rude and our room was not ready when we arrived. Other than that, it was a good stay. Would go again in hopes of nicer maid services. The door man was very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share the details of your recent stay. While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude. The team works hard to deliver exceptional service, it's clear we failed with your stay. We will discuss with the team to insure this does not happen further.

I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful. The hotel is easy to find and is very close to the downtown area and sports arenas. The hotel has a nice restaurant and a nice sports bar. My hotel room was clean and seemed to have been recently updated.,1
The service is always awesome. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by the person behind the counter the person who opens the door for you. Upstairs in the O Bar they took great care of our party. I left my phone and they immediately tracked me down. It was fortunate because I was in their free shuttle... More,1
"Bad: Problems with door lock led to no response from maintenance and even after security got us in, they failed to fix the lock (had to be recoded) despite assuring us they fixed it. So we got locked out again the next morning. Cost us 2 frustrating hours. Good: Location is good for business, quiet but close to everything.",1

"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!",1

The hotel was very very clean with up to date interior furnishings and bedding. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

"Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night.",1
"Very clean, relatively new hotel. Flat-screen tv's in rooms and great restaurant on ground level. Highly recommended for business travelers. If you are looking to really enjoy Baltimore and relax, this may not be the hotel for you. You will end up spending a lot of for cab rides.",1
We stayed at this hotel when it was a Hyatt sot that was some time ago.  I would say that everything has improved since Sheraton took over.  The Staff is excellent as well as the restaurant and bar.  The room was very comfortable and quiet.,1

I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay.

I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool.

"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day.

My stay here was pretty cool for the 1st time. This was my 1st time getting a hotel by myself and the experience was cool and relaxing. At 1st I was hesitant about getting a hotel here because of the rating but good thing I decided to check it out for myself. The only few thing was that the bathroom fan is loud and the actual unit only blew out cold air. But other than that it was very relaxing.,1

"Perfect for a family of four on Chincoteague. Clean, friendly, well-appointed, convenient to everything. A no-hassle getaway for a holiday weekend.",1
"The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area.

I generally stay here when I go home for a visit. It is in my budget and well maintained. It is in a good location.,1
Some of the Front desk staff were knowledgeable others had very little information on the immediate area. When asked to recommend an Italian restaurant She had no idea. That was just one issue we had with front desk. Another complaint would be that the pool was so murky No one was using it.,1

There was a roach crawling around the coffee maker/microwave area when I walked into the room after check in. The shower caulking had a lot of mold.,1
"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.",0
easy to washington,1
"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again.",0
"They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler. The pack-n-play was already set up in the room when we got there. The internet was easy to connect and pain-free. The room was clean. Overall a very good experience.",1

"The hotel has been updated. The rooms are fresh and there is a new gym. You always get the best slip and fantastic linens, pillows, mattresses, etc. Bring your wallet though.

"From check in through check out, EVERYTHING about this hotel was amazing!! The facilities and rooms were better than the internet pictures...... The staff was very helpful and did what ever it took to make us happy and the price was very favorable!! If I ever need a hotel again, anywhere near Harrisburg... I will definitely be staying here.",1
The staff was very accommodating...very friendly. The beds are very comfy..I love being in the front I get to see everything around the hotel.,1
I had to change my from because room 610 tub looked like it was painted on the inside. The hotel served it purpose for an overnight stay..No 4 or 5*.overall decent for 1 night.,1
"Virtually the only place for any regular live music and good entertainment in town or to have interesting, intelligent conversation with the awesome staff. A very lively and intimate bar.",1
"We were on a family trip and had an unexpected overnight. Pulled up, walked in, were treated well, and check in was a breeze. The pool facility was nice, the room was clean and nearly brand new. The breakfast was everything you needed. The parking lot felt safe and have 0 complaints or concerns about this property.",1
"Stayed two nights here while attending a sporting event at Centurylink Center. The hotel is an easy drive from downtown, and just a mile from Westroads Mall with shopping and restaurants. It's a little hard to find. I requested a quiet room and it was granted. Nice updated kitchen and clean room. The only think I didn't like was the... More",1
"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown.",1
Clean rooms and generally quiet made for good sleeping. The breakfast in the morning with eggs and waffles just can't be built. I have stayed here for 3 nights each week for the last 3 weeks and will continue to do that for the next 3 weeks. The prices are reasonable and I have recommended this hotel to my co-workers (who have also stayed here at times now).,1
Loved this hotel. Great rooms and staff. Pool area is nice and it's available for use at anytime.the one time it rained our family went into the lounge area and the staff was ok with it. So much to do within walking distance. Great location.,1
"Best Holiday Inn we have stayed in ever and we have stayed in a few, wonderful reception from the lady at the front desk, we where upgraded to a suite and what a room, big, clean, desk lounge everything you need when travelling.

"This is the second time that we've stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean, check in/ check out was a breeze the continental breakfast wasn't bad either. I like that the hotel is secluded but the mall restaurants are less than 5 minutes away. Pretty good for a last minute find. Darn those airplanes though..... :-)",1
"This Hampton Inn never fails to provide great service, clean rooms and friednly staff. Their common areas are well situated and convenient for our sports teams to gather before leaving for the competition site.",1
"Even though this resort was highly recommended by our travel agent, we had no idea it was going to be such a joy to stay there. This was our first trip to Hawaii as a family, and our three teenaged daughters (ages 19, 16, and 13) absolutely loved it. Even though it did seem there were a lot of younger... More",1
"I had a great stay. It was easy access to the interstate, as well as easy access into downtown DC. I must say I was disappointed with having to pay for parking. Overall breakfast was good, but on two different days I had to contact the concierge about sour dairy products. The problem was fixed, but it made me leary. Well rested nights. This is good deal.",1
"The breakfast buffet was phenomenal! The challenge was getting out of bed and get to breakfast on time!! The bed was very comfortable! Also, the breakfast staff were very hospitable. One of the chef (big guy) was wonderful at making sure we had the food we needed. He was very attentive to all guest needs. I will definitely stay again!",1
This Hampton Inn location was easily accessible and well kept. We enjoyed our nice comfortable rooms. The bathrooms were clean and the room as well as the hotel had a nice clean smell that reassured cleanliness. We would definitely consider staying at this property again.,1
This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston,1
The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! They were so eager to make our stay pleasant. They really went the extra mile to be friendly. The problem for us was the size of the room and bathroom. The doorway was VERY small and my husband had difficulty getting through with our bag - he had to push bag in and then step in. The ceiling was very low in the hallway and the bathroom. I am 5'6 and I could easily reach up and touch the ceiling in the hallway and bathroom. We even made the comment that no basketball stars would be able to stay here. My husband is 6'1 and had to duck to get into the shower. The outside noise was also very loud and woke us up both mornings. The room we had was nice and clean though.,1
"This is an excellent location, priced right. Best of all was the staff, especially Stephanie! She assisted the family with room needs and was extremely professional and courteous. Every family member commented on the kindness shown by Stephanie as unlike that found at many locations. The location is near both Dallas and Ft. Worth making it easy to access either.",1
"We had a great visit. The resort was designed to be what you imagine hawaii to look like - great sunrise - great sunset - staff dedicated to making you happy. No complaints at all. My daughter loves sitting by the pool, jumping off the rocks, switching to the hot tub, and then having a lava flow. Does it get... More",1
"This is a beautiful, clean, well-maintained hotel located one block off of Bourbon Street. We had a first floor room--presumably loudest in terms of street noise, but apart from hearing people in the lobby checking in or out, it was incredibly quiet! The bathroom is tiny but very clean, the towels are plush and large, the bedding is luxurious. The... More",1
"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring.",0
My husband and I stayed at the Benson for Memorial weekend as our friends were getting married. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The room was a bit small but otherwise great. Very clean and super comfy Tempurpedic beds. Also centrally located- we could walk to everything!,1
"When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever.",0
"I stayed there with my daughter and nephew and after reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much. I guess that's the good part because it was no where near as bad as I thought it was going to be. Our room was clean, had a microwave and refrigerator which not all rooms have apparently. Everyday the room was nicely made,... More",1
Stayed for Business. Will not come back. The room was small for 2 beds. The Sheets had cigarette burnt stains.,0
"Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's.",1
Stay overnight to enjoy time at the Baseball Museum and Stadium. Hotel very convenient to a lot of restaurants. Hotel staff were very informational. Hotel were very precise and peaceful in spite of multiple weddings. Would definitely like to go back. Thanks.,1
"Nice surprise in Spearfish! Our room was very comfortable, spacious and clean. The property is a little old, but very well maintained. The staff we encountered was very friendly. Would definitely stay here again if we are in this area.",1
"The rooms were comfortable, clean, and quiet. The breakfast was fine. Fitness room was fine if you could figure out how to get the door open with the room key it tended to be stuck in the locked position. A big plus to the hotel was friendly, helpful staff, both at the front desk and the breakfast area. There are... More",1
"Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding.",1
"Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful.",1
I was very surprised by how modern the hotel was. I heard stories that the hotel wasn't up to par but I found it to be very nice and clean. I would stay again.,1

The room was very nice. I can't think of a way it could have been improved. The staff has pleasant and eager to please. I highly recommend this hotel.,1

"Stay was ok, but a little expensive for what you can expect. Bad smell in the room, otherwise it was good.",1

This is a fabulous hotel. Very reasonably priced. Very clean comfortable beds. Breakfast was very good. Everything you could want including omelets. All of the staff is helpful and friendly. You will enjoy .,1
"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel.",1
Fantastic place to stay! Unique environment combined with excellent service to make the perfect location to stay. There was a level of service here that I have not experienced anywhere else in Phoenix. I will definitely return and recommend to other travelers.Thank you so much! We're happy to hear you had a great stay!,1
"This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,",1
"I loved this hotel! Got in late to find the room lights and tv on! It was great, I didn't have to drag my bags into a dark room and find the lights. So, comfortable, great sleep and oh man great shower!!",1
"This was third stay at Marriott and we have been pleased with all phases of service and comfort that Marriott offers to their visitors. They offers a great breakfast and the employees go out of their way to take care of us. If the visitor has their own rental car, they can visit the complete Vegas area as they wish. We came down for the Nascar races and we were happy with each visit. My boys and I recommend Marriott for a great place to stay in Vegas",1
"This Hampton Inn is one of the friendliest hotels. It is clean, well run, and centrally located. In particular, Diana at the front desk was exceptional! She is always smiling, and willing to help in any way. We always stay at this hotel when visiting Tampa Bay Downs, and would highly recommend it.",1
"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",1
Excellent travel and it was a relax place to visit,1
"We stayed here one night due to travel for an Eagles game. For the money,not a bad deal.",1
"The room was nice, locations was great, very comfortable. Only thing was there were small roaches in restroom and tub.",1
"Nice hotel, great location, easy access to freeway. Pretty tropical landscaping, really nice pool fitness area. Front desk staff, friendly. Beds comfy, clean, fridge, table. Only issue seemed to be a funny smell that came and went the AC, took long for room to cool the lower the temp, unit would make a loud noise. Not sure if smell coming from the actual unit.",1
"Bad: Me and my husband came to Chicago for our 10 year wedding aniversary. My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink. Good: The front desk people were very helpful and nice - especially Emily Mendoza.",0
Good hotel in the Prince Frederick MD area. The hotel was very well maintained and our room was spotless and comfortable (although the mattresses are on the firmer side). Reasonably priced as well. Having the free breakfast buffet was a plus and a time saver.,1
"We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant.",0
My family of three stayed one night. We were very happy with the size of our room.

"I have stayed at this hotel several times. It has a great location 1/12 blocks from Broad Street. The public area are very nice, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely sized and well furnished. My only complaint is that the walls provide very little barrier to sound. We could easily hear the people in the adjoining room and the hallway. With a number of weddings going on the sound level was probably more than typical, however, be aware that your room could be noisy depending on who you are adjacent to.",1
"nice staff, good service. convenient location",1
"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again.",1
I stayed at this hotel recently. A few things to note. 1. I got the hotel on priceline for 41 for the night. What a steal! 2. We arrived at the hotel and owner did not seem pleased that two men would be sharing one bed. His look of disgust on his face was clear. That made me feel very... More,0

I will stay at this hotel every time I travel to Oklahoma City. The staff are friendly and professional. The room was very nice and most important clean. The bed is made with wonderful soft sheets. I have nothing negative to say. This was my 2nd stay. 5 star stay without the 5 star price.,1

My family and I stayed here one night pre-cruise. I was only looking for a decent place to lay our heads for the night and I guess this fit the bill. I should've known what I was getting for the price but I was being optimistic. Cons: The room smelled musty and damp but I guess we got used to... More,1
"We recently traveled to Burnet on a business trip and stayed at this hotel. This property was clean and well maintained. The front desk was most helpful. We enjoyed the ample breakfast .The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Good value for the money. We would highly recommend this hotel.",1
My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible.,1
"Comfort Suites was so accommodating to us during our visit. We made an error and did not book the last night of our stay. Even tho they were fully booked for Saturday night, the staff did everything they could to successfully find us a room. Thank you again! Also, bedding and pillows are wonderful!",1
The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again.,0
"Excellent friendly and accommodating staff. Close to shopping and restaurants. Great hot tub, workout room and pool. Breakfast was good. Close to Brewery and wineries and attractions including Watkins Glenn raceway. We would definitely stay here again.",1
Never again! The rooms comforters were stained terribly and found hair on sheets. They gave us another room and it looked the same. You get what you pay for I guess. We left and drove to another hotel,0
"We checked in late...around 1 am. The lady at the desk was really nice and she was every night we saw her. I was disappointed with the front desk during the days. We needed clean towels at one point and were told we had to wait until housekeeping came in....which was one hour later! I know from other hotel stays that they could have at least got some for us to pick up. The room did smell a little bit musty also. Over all it was a decent stay. It did have a very convenient access to the highway heading in to D.C., so that was a plus.",1
Proximity to waterfront and downtown Seattle. Room was comfortable and service was good. You can walk to Space needle from this location. Ask for a waterfront facing room. Standard breakfast and internet.,1
I have just discovered the Drury Inns. We stayed in the University one last year and recently the Northlake location. You can not go wrong with either one. This Drury Inn like the other had a great staff. Lola and Ashley went above and beyond to make sure we had every thing we needed. They are both an asset to... More,1
"Bad: The room wasn't the nicest. The air didn't get cool enough. Good: I liked the format of the room with a living area, kitchen and bedroom. The gym was great.",1
The candlelight inn was great. The room were so pretty and cozy but extremely clean as well. The owner was very friendly and hospitable. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious. I highly recommend staying at this bed and breakfast!!,1
"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again.",1
"The rooms were comfy and big. Not many minutes from the boardwalk or city centre. On the negative side the surrounding area is a bit gritty, but that is a AC problem, so you really cant blame the hotel.",1
"We were pleased with our stay, for the most part. The carpeting in the hallway seemed kinda dirty, but our room was clean. I didn't like that breakfast was only until 9 am. And the breakfast hostess, who was very nice, started taking it all down at 8:50. She did tell someone if they wanted yogurt, she would go in the back and get it. But I felt like I had to rush through breakfast.",1
"We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!",1
"I booked this hotel for one night, because I was attending a funeral. The stay was ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. However, they charged my credit card on top of already having paid through Expedia. I called eleven times to get things straightened out and left messages with three different managers. NOBODY will apologize. This was on my check-card, needless to say it messed up my balance and i couldn't even buy gas to get home!!!!!! It was hard enough with a toddler, funeral and now this!!",1
"The Aria is a beautiful hotel and clearly justifies its 5 star rating, from the deep lush comfy mattress of the beds to the in room tech which is brilliant. The housekeeping is also exceptional, so why is this hotel in my opinion not 100 perfect. I like to wake and rise with a coffee, I would of liked a... More",1
Great stay last night. Room was spacious and clean. The TV didn't have a lot of channel options. The ladies at the front desk were very friendly. Parking was an extra 9 per day that I wasn't aware of. Breakfast was average.,1

"This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it. We are so glad you choose The River Hotel for your first visit to Chicago as our prime location makes an ideal base for experiencing all the city has to offer. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!",1
This hotel just recently had a complete remodel. Our room was absolutely clean and beautiful! Everything was comfortable and breakfast was great! The front desk staff were super! If ever in the area I will definitely stay here again.,1
"Great menu, service and the food was superb. The Seafood Pescatore over Linguine was tremendous. Drinks and food were very large portions and reasonably priced. All waitresses were tremendous, courteous, friendly and very attentive. Food preparation and quality was fab!!",1
Bad: No bathroom vent.,1
"Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay .",1
I could not get connected to wi-fi. They had to change my room because there was not any hot water. There was not any food available for lunch. The night time manager was very rude. The day-time manager was very nice and helpful and so was the breakfast waitress. I was not very happy with my stay.,0
Awesome,1
"This place had everything. location,quality and friendly staff.The property was well maintained and clean. The rooms were very nice and they offered a better than average breakfast. My room was very clean and everything worked just right.",1
Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st,0
"Bad: Beds were very hard and lumpy, rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the AC cooled barely. Good: Ease of access to multiple things, great places to eat.",1
Room was across street from ocean. It's confusing so be careful when you book. I booked non ocean view but didn't think that meant I had to cross street. I think there are some non ocean view rooms on the side of ocean but not sure. It wasn't a big deal though as it was a small walk.,1
"Ok, this hotel is s very predictable Express. Clean, accessible to 101, good parking, lots to eat for the included breakfast. For the area, wine country, the room rate is very good. And no minimum two-night stay on the weekends. But if you are looking for ambiance for a wine vacation, look for something else, but you'll pay twice as... More",1
"Bad: Pool crowded with local moms tots. Would love common gathering room, all designated common space is also used for meetings and were booked while we were there. Good: Charming, quiet, clean- friendly staff! Fun happy hours at tiny corner bars. Beautiful courtyard garden. Large fire pit out front.",1
Best service all round For the price you pay the rooms are clean and spacious. Facilities could be improved within apartments but nothing that was un comfortable. The receptionist were helpful and friendly. Would recommend to anyone,1
"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building.",1
"Room was a little scary. Someone or something had been locked in the bathroom, it was all scratched up and grimy. Ewww.",0
"Great service ,good hot breakfast! My family and I were in town for my grandfather's funeral. The staff were very sincere and accommodated us to the best of their ability. Overall, the hotel and staff were great.",1
Came to stay on way home from Baltimore- testing for husband- and had to meet in moyock NC. So decided rather then drive to OBX and turn around and drive back we stayed in Newport News. The staff was very nice- the room quiet and comfortable- and the area good for eats and shopping.,1
Bad: Valet scrapped my car on the wall and no fridge in the room. Good: It was clean and close to everything!,1
Bad: The bathroom was gross. The inside of the tub was peeling.The ceiling looks as if it had a previous flood upstairs. Good: The buffet was good.The location of the hotel was great.,1
"This is not a super luxurious hotel with expensive furniture and fancy rooms. But for what it is, a chain with the usual rooms and extras, it is everything one could ask for. We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory. We would stay there again.Thank you for your review and we will see you on your next visit to Napa.",1
"First off, the buses to parks were awful!! We waited 2 different morning over 45 mins for a bus and even missed a breakfast character breakfast!! We stayed near the Carriage house(the main lobby) which was very convenient but with limits on beverages for free cups it just wasn't worth it to use. NO juice or milk!!! We had children... More",1
"The hotel is very nice, even more than I expected! The room is soacious but the queen beds are small! The lobby is very nice and the breakfast at the bistro is delicious! And the snacks in the market are top quality! Service is great!! Had a very pleasant stay here!",1
"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget.",1
"Went to eat at their buffet. They have a variety of foods. Good food for a great price. If it's your first visit, you get a discount on the buffet. We also did a little bit of gambling. I was in town visiting family and they informed me of other things you can do such as bowl and catch a movie.",1
"Very disappointed...this is a 3 star It is a 40+ year old hotel they are trying to bring up to date. I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary.",0
"My wife and 2 boys loved the room. 2 Bedroom suite was perfect for us and the view is unbeatable. The first day we checked in we went to the pool and immediate greeted by Josh at the pool. He was very nice and extremely helpful. He got us all set up with towels, snorkel gear, and cabana for the... More",1
"Nice room with privacy barrier when traveling with children. Larger room than normal with separate bathing from vanity. Comfortable beds with freshly cleaned spreads! Free breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately, 19 parking. ( The only drawback.)",1
Good place to stay. Breakfast could have been a little better as it was the same everyday. They serve scrambled eggs in breakfast which wasnt cooked well and was prepared in hurry. The staff were very professional and helpful.,1
"Good: great location. room was clean and comfortable, Staff was very nice and helpful.",1
"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon.",1
"Good workout facility, eliptical machines and treadmills with TV's, abs machine and free weights. Nice room. Few blocks from the Metro and a shuttle runs to the Pentagon City station and Reagan Airport. Usual good Embassy breakfast, friendly competent staff.",1
Would stay again. Enjoyed our stay. Only problem was we had no refreg. or microwavE in one of the rooms. The trolley to kings dominion was not always available. Waited for 45 minutes and then I walked. Enjoyed the dog kennel on kings dominion site.,1
"For the price, definitely worth it. And, other than the Petit Jean lodge and cabins (which probably have to be booked WAY in advance), it's the only place convenient to the park, so for that reason alone, I would stay there again, for sure.",1
"Amazing and wonderful! Clean!! Susan, at the front desk, went above and beyond to give us great accommodations on very short notice! We will be back! I Highly recommend! This is an updated hotel that gives a very good first impression when you walk in the door. The rooms don't disappoint. Very affordable too!",1
"The room was clean, the amenities nice. Attached is one of the best diners I've ever eaten at, complete with an old-fashioned ice cream fountain that took me back to my youth. Portions were generous and the quality of the food excellent. The motel staff were nice and helpful when possible.",1
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt after staying at another resort on the Big Island which was lovely, but we were blown away by this facility - Grand indeed! Location was beautiful and the staff was excellent (with the exception of one bartender who wasn't interested in waiting on us.) The restaurants on premise had excellent food and beverages. After...

Bad: Short staffed at the registration desk. Good: Great location and price was right,1
We have stayed at this motel many times while visiting family in Tennessee. I never even consider another motel. We have always been treated very well here. Everyone is considerate and friendly. The prices are just right and the location is convenient for us. I recommend it highly.,1

She keeps a close eye on... More",1
"The only downside to this hotel is the service that came with the breakfast buffet. She was rude, abrupt and confrontational when asked any questions. Beyond that I would have easily given this hotel a perfect 5 star rating. It is quiet, beds are so comfortable, front desk is amazing! The location is walking distance to really great food and...

Stayed there to be close to downtown disney,1
"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle",1
"I was there with a little worry. Buy I enjoyed so much . It has been remodeled and find no problem . With new management and outstanding quality control, I enjoyed so much. Free WiFi and cable TV, Etc.... moderated rate,, Perfect !!! Good experience....",1
"Stayed one night at this Best Western for a half marathon the next morning. Overall, hotel gave the impression of being slightly dingy and outdated and was the type of hotel where all the rooms are accessed from an outdoor hallway. The service was friendly and helpful and the room was relatively clean and comfortable enough. Some stains on the carpet at the door though. Did not eat the breakast since we were up early for the race but I saw at check in that the dining room spilled out into the lobby which I thought was a little crowded looking to say the least. Great location as it was close to the plethora of wineries nearby and also close to several shopping and dining areas. Close to major highways without being noisy too. Next time I'd search for a slightly nicer hotel but this visit was satisfying for our needs.",1
Although the hotel was a bit run down we enjoyed our week long stay. The staff were really helpful and friendly and it had a swimming pool which was a bonus! The shuttle service is good. If your not looking for a fancy hotel then I would recommend staying here. Lots of good resturants near by abs easy to get the metro to Washington.,1
"Good location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Just a few minutes from the beach.",1
"This is one of my all time favorite hotels. I know it may sound absurd, but one reason I look forward to visiting SF is to stay here! The hotel staff is great, friendly and super competent.

"From booking reservations out of state to check in to breakfast, the reception we experienced by the staff was heart warming and genuine. Hampton Inn went beyond any expectations we had during our stay.",1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: For a 6 day stay, the space was wonderful",1
"Hotel was most accommodating for the time we spent in St. Louis. I would highly recommend the Hampton for anyone planning a medical or leisure stay in St. Louis. Only minutes from everywhere we needed to be, especially the local restaurants on the Hill.",1
This is a nice hotel with a nice breakfast area that is well kept and the food was fresh and tasty. There was a lot of seating so we did not have to wait for someone to leave so we could eat. It was a stay on the go so we did not use the facilites much. The room was... More,1
i will stay here again can't beat the price but was not impressed this time. This is the 3rd time I have stayed here in 2 weeks. I was in line at the front desk to check in (1 person ahead of me and literally 3 families totaling 15 people behind me and the guy at the desk spent five minutes on the phone while everyone waited talking apparently to his manager about who was coming to relieve him because he though someone quit. I stayed in the 3rd building this time and it was a huge difference from building 1 which was nice. Building 3 is not in as good a shape the halls were dirty and it was like going into the motel 6. def should stay in building 1,1

Stay away. Booked with Hotwire as a 3 star hotel with a 95 approval rate. Hotwire should be ashamed. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. I feel dirty just thinking about this place.

"My husband and I stayed here for a FL spring dive weekend. Hotel was nothing to write home about, it's average. On a row of hotels right off the exit.

"Bad: Expensive! I know that it was but the room i expected to be way better as a mega room seemed so regular , the price wasn't worth it . Good: Nice scenery",1
"Bad: We could easily hear steps from the room above us, we were on the second floor, so I had to call like twice at the front desk to complain about the noises on the room above. Good: Close to the theme parks, free parking lot, good breakfast.",1
"Here on business and there are limited choices, so I decided to try this because of the ratings. I arrived and checked in and my door was unlocked. Fingerprints, stains and hairs. This is surface cleaning, so the thought of what hasn't been deep cleaned in a while is scary.",0
Good: It was a great location and had amazing decor.,1
"The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen",1
"This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. A bit out of the way, but well worth the hunt. Everything was spotless, the tv was great.

"Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town.",1

"My daughter and I stay here on our way to California. Our was nice, our room was clean and very pleasant. The location of the hotel was very close to I-10. However as the night progress and more guest arrived, we could hear footsteps above us as the guest walked around. Also we had a non-smoking room, but we could smell cigarette smoke from our restroom.",1
"Only spent a night at the hotel at the end of November. Location is great with access to the boardwalk. Room was clean and checking in and out went without a hitch.

"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.",1
Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price.,1
"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
Hotel condition is great and the room is of great comfort as well.,1

"This property provided us with an extremely enjoyable stay, the beds were excellent, the dcor and cleanliness excellent. the food outstanding, our BEST stay at a Best Western. If we are ever in this neck of the woods again, we will definitely stay at this Best Western.",1
I was traveling to the University of Illinois for meetings with faculty and wanted a more convenient hotel than the Hilton Garden Inn. The Hampton is directly across the street from the Beckman Institute. I was able park my car at the hotel and attend all my meetings without driving. I could even walk (1 mile) downtown for dinner. The... More,1
Excellent.,1
"Nothing spectacular. Average. Disappointed by breakfast: there was no table available, I had to wait for 15 minutes. Rooms are ok, nothing really special. Location is good , close to restaurants and stores",1
Staff was friendly and efficient especially when transporting to and from the airport. Service was quicker than using the long term parking at the airport. We will definitely stay here again when flying out of KC airport. Bed was comfortable and for the price it was nicer than other places we have stayed. Our only complaint was the bathroom floor...

"There is no elevator at this property. Disabled guests will find it difficult to get to any rooms other than those on the ground level. The restaurant is good and the breakfast staff is excellent. A nice view of Moses Lake. The property is not exactly on the main route through the town, but we found that our GPS managed... More",1
"We have stayed at this hotel several other times and it has not improved. There are not many in the area and a football game at Penn State that weekend filled those up and raised the price quickly. This hotel is old, run down and lacks many amenities, but we slept there only and were gone during the days for... More",0
"What a cool property. If you like Route 66, you will love this place. Classic basic terrazzo floors in the lobby that you'll find after you locate the dark street entrance to the back parking lot off of Eads. I circled twice thinking there must be a service road to the front entrance. The framed picture in the lobby confirms... More",1
My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this property. It was located within walking distance to Canal and Bourbon St. The only unexpected things were the price of parking and the 50 a day hold on our card. The hold is refunded though.,1
"Bad: Front desk guy was grumpy at check in. Breakfast was very confusing, half buffet half waited on. Good: Clean convenient location",1
"Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2.",0
"Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights",1
"we usually stay in Hilton Products. I had read an article about Drury and was intrigued so we decided to expand our horizons WOW, am I glad we did! From the reservation clerk through the housekeeping staff everyone was friendly, always smiling, eager to offer assistance. This was a somber trip as we had just lost our grandmother and had...

"It was wondering, I had a great time, food was great",1
"A beautiful, historic hotel in a perfect location with a fantastic staff (and great bar). The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star review is the forced air heating system in our room, the vent for which was located over the bed and kicked on every so often, waking us up with an initial blast of cool breeze before it warmed up...",1
I can't say one negative thing about this hotel. When I arrived the bellhops greeted me and showed me inside where I was greeted by a friendly employee and checked in in less than 5 minutes. My room was 437 and was very quiet and had a nice view over the front entry area and up the road - I... More,1
"The hotel was alright. The service wasn't bad. The cast restaurant served good food. Kyle at the valet was horrible. I felt ignored by him as I stuck my ticket out for literally 3 minutes, his eyes were glued to his cellphone. Never valet here.",1
"Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Right away, we did notice the remote didn't work, so I asked the front desk for some new batteries. They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation.",1
"The lobby of the hotel looked like an old-fashioned inn -- should have taken a picture, but it was something a little fun and different on a long road trip. Room was clean and well-kept, breakfast was fresh with lots of choices. They had a movie my kids happened to love playing in the breakfast area, which was a welcome... More",1
I always enjoy my stay at this hotel. It's like my home away from home. If there is ever any issues they will do their best to correct it as soon as possible. The rooms are great and the beds are so comfortable.Thank you for choosing the Best Western Plus in Portage 773tabathae and the great comment. We look forward to seeing you again very soon!,1
Everything was great!! We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Grove City!!,1
I bought a night at this location off of Trip Advisor and I got a really good rate for this area. The bed was awesome I had a really good night sleep. The view of the ocean was very tiny and I was told that if I wanted a better view I'd have to pay more even though there were... More,1
What a fantastic position! We were so lucky and had an upgrade to a beautiful ocean view room. The bed was so comfortable and with very quiet air conditioning we had a brilliant nights sleep. Sad that breakfast wasn't included in the price so that's the reason for 4 stars but we found a fantastic breakfast at Joan's on third... More,1
"As a frequent guest at the Aria, our most recent trip was almost as expected. The property in general is outstanding for it's facilities and its location on the strip. The modern decor and high end furnishings definitely make the Aria stand out from other resorts . However, we have began to notice a small degradation of the quality of... More",1
"Good: helpful friendly staff, excellent location, clean, light beautifuly decorated rooms, comfortable bathroom (normal shower with a shower hand! :) ), pool that you can almost have for your own use as there were not many people using it.",1
"We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home.",0
The microwave and refrigerator was not working and the iron was missing from the room. I also did not receive the wi-fi connection information at check-in. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nice breakfast eating area and food was tasty.,1
We can't remember how many times we have stayed at Brewster By The Sea over the years. Each time it is a relaxing and memorable experience. Byron and Donna makes us feel like family each time we visit. They are wonderful hosts and make every effort to ensure we have a perfect visit. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable....

The experience was ok. It was nice hotel . Staff was pleasant.,1
"I needed a place away from the airport noise and chose this hotel. The small kitchen with refrigerator is very convenient for someone like me that likes to save some money on food. The room was clean and the employees super nice. I recommend anyone to stay here!We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and for choosing to stay with us. I'm so pleased to hear that you valued the fully equipped kitchen in your room, the cleanliness of your room, and your overall stay at our hotel. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!",1
"I can't think of anything I would have changed. JoAnn, the person at the desk, was amazing--managed to juggle phone calls and a line of people with courtesy and grace. The accessibility to Annapolis, rates, and cleanliness were outstanding. We'll definitely be back!",1
"Stayed here for a week before boarding the Carnival Glory - it was amazing - room was SO comfortable!! Really really enjoyed ourselves - towel animals each evening and chocolates on the pillow were a lovely touch! Visited in October, hotel wasn't very busy which we liked. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice and whenever I couldn't finish... More",1
Location. Difficult to find a bellhop to assist with luggage.,1
"Started with front desk people getting me into my room early...excellent. Received my hot, chocolate chip cookie upon check-in...perfect. Spot was about 3 blocks from the METRO station...plus. Staff was really attentive and helpful.",1
"We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family! And it's only a couple blocks to Union Square.Good Morning JudyZ24,We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us. I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay. We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon.Regards,Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham Canterbury at San Francisco",1
"We spent one night here on our way to Los Angeles. It was a nice place, very clean and modern. Neighborhood is OK - right near freeway and fast food. Not quite what I was expecting. Complimentary breakfast is the standard fare. Would recommend.",1
