"The Pier 5 Hotel is excellent for a quite romantic weekend. Once you check in, you have Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmick's right off the hotel lobby. Within walking distance is the entire Baltimore waterfront district with nightclubs for just about everyone. The only downside was parking. While parking is available next to the hotel, the cost is 22.00 per pay and if you use valet parking, it 29.00 per day. You would think for the price they charge per night for a room, parking would be included.",1
"I have never been treated more like an honored guest than during my recent stay. The property is fine but the staff is exceptional. Mail deliveries, lost keys local hints, all were managed very well, The weekend manager in particular is full of good local knowledge.",1
A stop for lunch was fine .,1
I came to know that this motel is newly renovated so I wanted to check it out. The rate was very reasonable.

We arrived a bit early to town for a wedding and stopped at the hotel just to see if by chance we could get an early check-in.

"With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed",1
Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!,1
"I'm not really a big fan of this type of suite. The last thing I want to do on a vacation is cook or do dishes. But I just ignored the kitchen area and the hotel was better than fine. The rooms were spotless. The bed was very comfortable. The amenities nice (free wi-fi was dependable, that's unusual). I cannot... More",1
"Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1
"I stayed at this hotel about a month before this stay and was not impressed. They were under construction so I decided to try it again. When I made the reservation, they made sure to tell me they were still under construction. I said I understood and all I was really looking to do was sit by the pool for... More",0
"As other reviewers have noted, this is a hotel that had it heyday in years past but for the price it is still comfortable and will give you a good nights sleep. They offer a breakfast, but I did not take advantage of it. The room was clean, but looked its age. Dark wood and curtains made it seem smaller... More",1

"Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!",1

I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.,0
I stayed in this hotel with many of my family members due to a wedding we were attending nearby. Room was spacious and felt really clean.

"I was a little worried when I saw the outside of Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center however, the inside has been beautifully redone and is absolutely wonderful! We will definitely stay here again. We stayed one night for the Thunder vs. Spurs game. Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center has free shuttle to the Arena which was a plus as we had no clue upon booking this hotel.",1
"This was our second stay at ARia. We booked during a promotion which was going to give us an upgrade to a strip view. Unfortunately, we were only able to see a little part of the strip, but who could argue, a strip view it was. Check in/ check out was fast, in spite of a moderate long lineup. We... More",1

"This place needs updating. The room had a foul odor. Sink wasn't working properly. While we were away during the second day, the staff emptied out the refrigerator. Don't know why they did this as our stay was for 3 days. Completely unacceptable. Will not stay there again.",1

Bad: no finger food during happy hour. Good: Great Breakfast,1
"My room was a nice one. Clean and comfortable. I was here with a group - 20 rooms booked for 4 nights stay and the hotel staff could not have been more professional or accommodating. If we decide to make our event an annual one, we will definitely come back here.",1
Nice hotel very friendly staff. Breakfast is pretty much standard. The only thing I would recommend is a bench in the front of the hotel. It has an indoor pool but we didn't take advantage of that. Flying J truck stop is right across the street it can get noisy on the west side at times.,1
"With the price, and with 4 kids tagging along, it was a pleasant stay! The front desk guy was Jermaine (if I recall correctly), and he was nice and very helpful. The lady at the breakfast station was also nice. In fact all the hotel staff that I met was nice and helpful.",1
"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable.",1
We stayed here for a weekend and really enjoyed it. The rooms are spacious and nice for the price. The staff was friendly and we were always greeted by them. My only qualm was sleeping. We had the room by the guest laundry and it was noisy at night. On our last night the bill was shoved under our door... More,1
Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that. I didn't feel comfortable staying there. Management was'nt helpful at all. I was there for my son's graduation from the Navy he had completed boot camp. So this was an important visit. We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all.,0
Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location,1
Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location.,0
I have stayed here a few times for business. It is a good location with lots of options for retail shopping and dining. The hotel is clean and the breakfast is good with fresh fruit and hot eggs in addition to standard fare. King of Prussia Mall is right across the street.,1
"I thought this would be a cute, quaint, retro motel but it turned out to be closer to Bates Motel than a Blue Sky experience. The carpet had stains, the pool was broken, there were dogs barking in one of the rooms and there were ants crawling in the bathroom sink. Won't be back.",0
"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp.",1
"I stay here about 1 week a year when I in Nashua for work. The hotel is nice, includes a breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, made to order omelets, etc. Rooms are clean and well appointed although it would be nice if they had a mini frig. Hotel has a nice pub for lunch or dinner and drinks.",1
Husband and I planned to stop in Blythe as a rest/sleep stop on the way back from sedona. Very clean and comfortable place to lay your head for a night. Bountiful free breakfast as well. The checkin/out process seems to need some work but it's a new hotel so that is to be expected.,1
"This place was very convienent to the Turner Falls Park (right next to it). The staff at Tuner Falls Inn were extremely nice and helpful. Although the property is a little outdated, our room was clean and the location was perfect. I loved the fact that our room had a kitchenette so that we could make our own meals if... More",1
"This hotel has one of the most exceptional staffs I have encountered in a hotel. The front desk clerk was so attentive and welcoming, asking us about our day and making sure all of our needs and questions were met. She is a gem. The hotel has a cocktail hour every evening with enough food during the week that you... More",1
Me and my 3 girlfriends went here. Bouncer was extremely rude to my friend who had sunglasses on and accused her of being drunk and barely let her into the club even though she didn't have anything to drink the whole day. Eventually we got in and paid cover but the pool closed 2 hours early. We still had an... More,0
"This hotel was very clean and staff was friendly. The major complaint I have is about the breakfast. It was lousy. The eggs had no taste and the sausage patty was super greasy with not much taste either. I tried toast. Believe it or not, it didn't taste good either. The toaster took so long to toast. Needs to be... More",1

The beds were conducive to a great night's sleep. We will be returning for our annual fall get away. Thanks so much Chef Dean an Nicole.",1
Just off I-95 and reasonably priced. Significant weekend savings on room rates but no free breakfast which is included with most weekday rates. Helpful and courteous staff. Meeting rooms for conferences and social gatherings.,1

"Hamptons and Hilton brands booked in Charlottesville, decided to stay out of town instead of settling for lesser quality. Glad we did! Only 30 miles on a scenic highway. Beautiful drive to and from C'Ville. Clean, up to date, all we expect from a Hampton Inn. Although not much immediately around hotel there is a gas station and fully stocked... More",1
"Ten minutes from Dares beach and 20 minutes from Chesapeake beach. The proximity to everything is second to none. The staff are amazing and they're very accommodating. The pool is small but it's useful and breakfast is your general high school breakfast. Only real negative is my sheets were stained. Regardless, I'd recommend this place.",1

"I went to Vegas with a girlfriend and we stayed in a standard room with 2 queen beds.

We walked through most of the hotels and casinos... More",1
We had a ground floor room with outdoor shower. The shower and steam room is amazing. Bardessono is a true luxury experience.

I love the Vegas style bakery, with so many choices. The crepes are heavenly! The pool is beautiful and relaxing. They even have a suite-member only pool.... More",1
"This room was exceptionally clean! Check in was speedy. The front desk staff was very helpful. The only downside was the free Wi Fi was very slow. This is the only reason I gave just a four rating. I slept well until a family leaving early was very noisy and woke me. This, of course, was not the property's fault.... More",1
"Very friendly staff and good location (free parking and free shuttle). Nearby highway overpass and road noise was a concern on my side of the hotel, but it is convenient, clean, inexpensive, and with very friendly and helpful desk staff -- they are so nice!",1

"This was the dirtiest and worst run hotel we've ever stayed in. It was so dirty we had to leave early and find alternative accommodation. Sticky carpets, dirty linen AC and fridge not working. Changed rooms but no improvement - no way could this be a 3 star hotel",0
"This hotel is in a beautiful location. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Eli at the front desk. Rooms were spacious qns clean with balcony looking over beach and ocean. Will definitely be booking there on my next trip to virginia beach.",1
"Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat.

Stayed in cabin 6. It was awesome. Everything about it was awesome. From the staff to other travelers staying there. Breakfast was great only problem with it was I ate too much. Rooms were very clean and fresh. I wanted to take the bed home with me it was so comfortable.,1
The Snow lol in I have to leave there How comfortable the bed in room was really nice I needed the peace in time to myself.,1
This is a very clean hotel. The staff is always very friendly and extremely helpful! The breakfast is worth every penny and I would recommend trying the French toast. I stay here at least every six months and I am always very pleased with every aspect of my stay!,1
The staff here was wonderful! Got us thru a rough time due to a funeral for a loved one coupled with the worst snow storm in the area in years!

"This has always been one of our family favorites when it comes to a vacation spot in both the summer and winter.

I would recommend a price cut or some major upgrades in the near future before people decide the place... More",1
"This Motel will be the last place in Washington, Pa I would ever stay again. The rooms say no smoking, yet the bed spread and blanket had burn holes in them. The furniture was old and broken. The bathroom was newly finished, yet had BLACK MOLD on the walls .When I let them know at the front desk, they really... More",0
"Service is excellent for a midlevel chain motel. Good location right off Hwy 54. Usually decent rates. Room design and cleanliness are just average, but you can't have everything for a midtier price. Location and typically excellent service more than make up for any shortcomings.",1
Bad: The room is very small. The footstep sound from other room can be heard. The wifi is too weak. Good: What I really like is the location and decorations. It only takes 5 minutes to beach.,1
"Not good, suppose to be there a freg. and microwave but I suffered and I have two kids.",0
"This Candlewood Suites near the airport was more than adequate for my overnight needs as I needed quick access to FLL for an early morning flight.

"Overall the hotel, area and staff are nice. But my first stay at this hotel was in December only to find that we had tiny ants all over our room, including our suitcase the next morning...YUCK! The hotel was very apologetic and offered me a free stay next time we were in the area. I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back.",1

My husband and I stayed here for one night to get away for a night away from the kids. The hotel is nice and I would stay again.,1
I have been to the Charles several times over the last 20 years. Some parts of the hotel are consistent over the years: the rooms are clean and the staff is professional. But the experience isn't really a luxury experience with attention to small details. The hotel made a mistake around our rooms (they were supposed to be adjoining which... More,1
Walking into the front of the building we were immediately greeted by Alexander a very personable and kind individual. He was very knowledgable about the area and pointing us in the right direction.

"Stayed for one night on a business trip. It was worth 60 a night with tax on a Friday, Very minimum small room. Looks renovated but the bathroom needs a lot of work! No wifi even though the front desk gave me a password it don't even work! The area is pretty sketchy not the best around!!! Summer is probably a little better. Breakfast was just coffee and one muffin.... Everything is small here I suggest to stay at a casino hotel next time.",1

We spent five nights at the Aria for our 1st anniversary. This was our second visit to this hotel. Once again they surpassed our expectations!!

"The facility was not bad for the price the room was clean, beds were good and everything worked. The people that stay there however were unpleasant to be around.On day1my girlfriend could not walk out of her room without getting harassed by a gentlemen with his pants on the ground so she had to be escorted every time she left the room. The same group partied till 5a.m. and our room wreaked of the weed smoke from the room next door. Day 2 there were several ferral children running around some naked all unattended while parents chain smoked Pall Malls on the steps. Again the facility was nice ,it was clean and was not bad except for the other guests.",0

"OK. I didn't actually put any lime in a coconut nor did I shake it all up - I am way too old for that.

"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay.

We had a great stay at the Ritz and would definitely stay there again. Everything was as you would expect.,1
"This hotel has a great location and is super quiet even though it is in the heart of downtown Gatlinburg. We stayed on the island and the rushing water on both sides of our room was so peaceful.

A friend had made reservations to this hotel that I knew nothing about getting there from the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport is a long but interesting drive being that it was my first time as an adult visiting Georgia. From the outside I thought boy this place is going to be average but when I went in I was so pleased... More,1
Great location oceanfront on Boardwalk. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room just need some updating and wasn't exactly clean. It just needs a more through cleaning than the everyday housekeeping and I think it would be back on track. This was our 3rd year staying here and will probably come again next year!,1
Very close to the Soco District and St Edward's University which was convenient since we were there to visit the school. Looks brand new. Rooms were spacious and super clean.,1
"Staff was very friendly and helpful!!! Good location, couple blocks from outlet shops and 3min walk to the beach and board walk. Neighborhood is not the best at night. But it is a good place to stay overall.",1
"I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel and the staff that keeps it running impeccably! I travel often for business and I was absolutely blown away by the wonderful customer service I received at this particular location. I have stayed twice, booked a third stay and look forward to it every single time. I went as far... More",1
"This is a good one, guys! Rooms are convenient and comfortable, with self check-in and number-pad doors that miraculously work. It's small (I think 5 rooms) and walkable to anywhere in Hilo. We stayed in the smallest (read: cheapest) room no. 2. Had everything we needed, even a little kitchenette. It got maybe a bit noisy with the street but... More",1
"We booked this facility because of the good location, the pictures online the description we got over the phone. It did not deliver! Management is very poor.r The facility is dirty. The meeting room is in a basement (with the 'weight room' a smelly, dirty, unusable kitchen bathroom.) they should be ashamed of the condition of this place what they charge. There are actually many 'long term' guests that reside there from what we could tell as well.r r Not the plac...view moree for a good nights rest in a clean room. Look elswhere.view less",0
"I'm a neat freak and this hotel felt comfortable. Very spacious too, we stayed in a resort view room and it has a living room with a t.v. and a sofa bed room with a separate t.v. and closet. The room comes with a washer and dryer too which was a plus and they use Aveda products for the bathroom.",1
The staff was extremely nice and helpful. They answered any questions and knew most information. Hotel had both the outdoor and indoor pools which was also nice. Breakfast area was large enough to accommodate a good number of people when crowded.,1
"We chose this hotel because it is attached to the KFC Yum center and was told we could use the skywalk to and from the center (without, essentially, leaving the hotel). Unfortunately the skywalk was closed going IN to the venue, but we were able to use it after the event. We still think this is a grand idea, however,... More",1
The Roosevelt staff is very friendly and ready with suggestions for tours and restaurants. The room was spacious and clean. Being centrally located it is an ideal spot for reaching all of downtown Seattle. Additionally it is easy to reach via LINK light rail public transportation from the airport.,1
This is a great place to stay to sleep. Thats what I was looking for. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean. Older hotel but updated. Can be loud as this is a motel. I felt very safe. Parking is easy. Good value for the money.,1
The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there. It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo. When I went to the front desk to ask for products I was told they only had a few! Was. It pleased with our stay at all,0
"Came up midweek for a quick break and an Orioles game, so did not spend much time in the hotel. But we were pleased with everything. Prices seemed high all over the area, perhaps because of an event at the convention center, so this was more than expected. But for what we wanted to do -- the aquarium, the ball game, a water taxi ride -- this is a great place to stay.",1
"We checked into this hotel prior and after we went on a cruise. Although the house keeping was not the greatest, we met a man named Henry that made the whole trip! He was so friendly, kind, helpful, knowledgeable and really just made the stay at the hotel that much better! If we had a question about where to eat,... More",1
We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities. We arrived at around 11:30 pm and were surprised to find a long winding line at the check in area. The line moved at an excruciatingly slow pace... More,0
"We stayed here because the price was right. Location was ok, just a quick walk to Fred Meyers the bus stop. Staff was very friendly. Room was tiny and old but clean, which matters the most. No a/c which might be ok on the other side but we were on the side facing the sun and it was quite... More",1
not good,0
"Nice sized room and a very beautiful view. The staff was very helpful and nice, however the room was definitely dated and not very clean. In my opinion, you could find a better stay for 100 in Luray.",1
"We had a 2bed room suite. It was clean loved the kitchenette although we didnt use it. Close to Hwy, shopping and resturants. 35 minutes from ORF airport. There was no real decor(pictures vases etc). The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would definately stay there again!",1
"It was Ok, but the conditions of the room needs to be more light and more clean.",1
Great the room was very nice n clean . We want to get away for day at beach. Wish had stay longer.,1
"Heater was blowing cool air in morning. Some things in the room seemed shoddy or unfinished like sprinkler, wall around the light switch, and when you first enter one of the lightswitches that I believe was meant to turn on the lamps did nothing. Also we were only there one nite but in that time our room keys both got deactivated. We were very pleased with complimentary breakfast offerings except that there was cream cheese but no bagels and the type of milks were not labeled.",1
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines on our trip to Napa. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a very helpful front desk clerk who made sure we had everything we needed. The rooms we clean and very nice. Overall I'd give this hotel a 100 and I'd definitely come again!Ronda S,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Come back soon !",1
"Someone probably a man and left the toilet seat up and hadn't flushed the toilet. Not a good look and not a comforting thought when you check into a room. My biggest pet peeve is hypoallergenic rooms should be part of a hotels standard capacity. Why should a consumer have to advise the front desk to have someone from housekeeping come in and change out pillows and maybe a comforter. Be proactive not reactive, it makes more the hotel more appealing to consumers and brand loyal",1
"Short stay, but very enjoyable. The management and staff were very courteous and informative. Sorry to have missed the Pony Penning, but did see some on Assateague Island nearby.",1
The first room we got was soaking wet. we called the front desk. The front desk clerk got us another room. We didn't care for the noise from the road near by. If you stay there don't stay in room 225. I wanted to stay down stairs they didn't have any rooms.,1
"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.",0
"great hotel within walking distance of Clinton Library and the capitol and all many places to eat and the service was great, just be aware parking is shared with a condo ,but plenty of parking and its 7 dollars a night extra but cheaper then anywhere in any other downtown city in USA",1
We did not get to the hotel until about 8:30pm. Left at 7:00am. Checked in and the person at the desk was very nice. Very good price for a short stay. In the parking lot I was past by a homeless person that was really high on drugs and said some rude things to me. I wish they had more... More,1
"Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee.",1
Great spot! Hip Chic hotel with good service. Rooms were very nice with unique steel construction. Restaurant was delicious and the location was great. Light rail stop right in front of the hotel. Highly recommend!Thank you so much! We hope to have you back soon.,1
"Looked for an overnight on a long journey so just wanted a clean, quiet, comfortable room at the cheapest price available and this establishment met those requirements for us. It's an excellent deal at a very excellent room rate. Loved our king size bed and tv and robust wifi. Very quiet,quick check in, clean surroundings. Obviously the management is quite particular about appearances as this is unusual compared to other Red Roof Inns we have seen. We picked it because of the other reviews and are impressed that the management responds to each review. That's personal attention! Our check in person was just neutral until I began a conversation. I think a welcome smile and greeting should be a given, but that is my only recommendation. Overall, for the price this hotel is exceptional.",1
"Good: The comfort in the bedroom was excellent, good blankets, soft pillows, a bathroom really clean, the staff was really nice.",1
"The front desk service was very good. The location and proximity to tourist attractions was great. The beds were very uncomfortable. We did have a problem with our room being cleaned one day which affected our ability to come back to the room and rest prior to dinner, however, when this was brought up to thefront desk they immediately addressed... More",1
"I stayed here with a couple friends. Very friendly hotel! The weather was terrible, cold rainy, in the Keys. The staff was super helpful in helping us find things to do. The location is far from all the action, but a quick cab ride away... worth the stay. Very clean.Thank you for sharing your comments with all of our trip adviser guests. I am sorry the weather did not cooperate on your recent trip to the Keys,you will need to come back to enjoy the Keys sunshine. Thank you for staying with us.",1
"Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you. We hope we have another opportunity to earn your business back please reach out to me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com or 504-312-7715.I hope to hear from you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",0
Bad: Not the most modern. Could stand upgrading. Good: Close to the beach. Quiet,1
"Just a one night stopover - Clean room, nice pool, friendly staff, adequate breakfast, not the best beds. I expect better beds from a Best Western. It was pretty good value for the price. Would stay again.",1
We stayed for one night on July 17th. We have stayed at the Dillon Motel a couple of other times as well. The rooms are always clean and the gentleman who owns the place is outstanding. Nice big pool and the morning cowboy coffee is great. Remember if you are wanting a chain hotel this is not it but this... More,1
I understand the whole middle of nowhere so we set our own prices but holy cow this is ridiculous! 100 for two double beds in a dingy room The only cool part was the restaurant which I was too afraid of the prices to actually give it a shot. If you have money to blow for absolutely the bare minimum... More,0
"Bad: I as if I could use my AARP OR AAA card for a discount on my room, question was never answered, got the run around from one person to another. I ask also on line during booking the room.",1
"Room was very quiet, clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again when in area. Lots of places to eat within walking distance. It is right on the interstate but we couldn't hear it. We stayed on the 3rd floor.",1
Bad: Breakfast was not enough. Hidden fee for parking. Hidden fee of 20 for taxes not included. Good: Great location. Clean rooms. Great value for money.,1
Normally very clean and comfy but this time room was musty and not as clean- Cob webs in bathroom. Next time if this happens i will get another room but I had a migraine and didnt want to mess with it!! I even had to go to the ER But next time i will request a clean room,1
"The rooms are small but well thought out. They are very cosy and comfortable. It is across from the Trump Towers and the river where you can get on a boat and go for a little cruise, the Big Bus company stops directly across the street from the hotel",1
"This hotel met all of expectations. Great breakfast, good value and convenient location.",1
"Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!",0
My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It's better than the reviews depict. We really appreciated Gary and all of his advice regarding the hotel and the city! ***just prepare to pay for parking. We weren't expecting this.. Roughly 27 per day,1
"Stayed here for the Steelers vs Colts game in December. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. Prior to booking I was worried about the location and how easy it would be to get to the stadium, but taking the T was extremely easy, safe, and clean. We were able to get back from the game in only... More",1
"We stopped at Grumpy's when we reached Silverton on the steam train. It was the end of the season, so the town was winding down, but Grumpy's sure wasn't! The piano player was great, and added to the old time atmosphere and decor. We had the French Onion soup and a salad.....not exceptional, but we had no complaints. The owner... More",1
Long term parking expensive compared to other hotels.,1
"This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience.",1
"Traveled Jan 2012 with mother in law and my 2 kids. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, very nice little place, very clean and spacious all the comforts of home. The pool was nice for the kids, liked that there was always a bus coming around to bring you to the different Disney park attractions.",1
"Just stayed at The Mills House with 3 girlfriends, it was wonderful. It is a beautiful hotel and close to the historic district. Didn't want to leave! Couldn't have been more perfect.",1
Bad: Plates outside of hotel room door when we arrived stayed there all day and evening. Good: Bed extra comfy. Very courteous staff.,1
"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston.",1
"Mary and Rose are so sweet! The whole family had a fantastic visit. The kids said we could live here forever. Staying here was like staying with your favorite out of town relatives. It was clean, homey and comfortable. Our studio even had a blender! We plan to come back for a longer visit next year.",1
Had a really lovely time at Seacrest oceanfront. We weren't overly happy with the first oceanfront room as the balcony was small and restricted the view so we were delighted to be moved to a ground floor room. The little extras added to the experience. The breakfast was good - the afternoon cookies enjoyed and the staff very helpful. Best... More,1

Nice location and convenient to the beach. The property is pretty old and outdated. The room had to many cockroaches. Cockroaches were on the desk and in the furniture. Would be nice if the rooms were pest free.,0

"This was our second stay at this location. We returned because we were impressed with the staff's attitude of extra mile service. We appreciate the Residence Inn's stocked kitchenette for when we just wanted to stay in, but the complimentary breakfast was a welcome option. The only factor for a 4 (actually 4+) was the food station is small to... More",1

They have American classics plus Hawaiian traditional favorites. I... More",1
"I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!",0
"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.",1
"The room was spacious enough, beds were okay, and it had a refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker, and a complimentary breakfast. That said, the hotel is older --as in, you get an actual key to your room. Yeah that old- the rooms have no air conditioning, just a window fan. It gets hot in the room on warmer days, and of...

"We stopped here on our way to drop our son off at Yale after a long day of traveling. Hotel was clean, quiet and well appointed. Couldn't ask for anything more. There are not a lot of restaurants directly near other than a Waffle House and a local drive in. So plan to drive for food or carry in.",1
"I travel extensively and normally visit at least three states per month for work. Hilton family hotels are my preference when I travel and I have stayed at a lot of them.

Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!,0
"Excellent service, great staff , I like the complimentary breakfast",1
Really enjoyed our stay ! Was clean! Breakfast was a little confusing with how to pay for it and get the kids breakfast for free. Had to ask a couple different people. But it was a great value. Would stay again.,1
"Great motel, especially if you want to be close to downtown and the MAX. Clean rooms, really helpful staff who know Portland, and excellent location.",1
"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all",1
"We needed a hotel close to the Buffalo Airport as we had a flight booked early morning the following day. We choose Aloft Buffalo Airport on a whim as the photos and amenities seemed intriguing. We were pleasantly surprised on our arrival. Checkin went very smoothly. The lobby was very nicely decorated, modern and clean. Our room was no different.... More",1
"Whenever I have to head down that way, I choose to stay at the Prarie Winds motel. The rooms are always clean, there is always a smiling face to help you with whatever you may need, and don't forget about the continental breakfast! Extremely reasonable rates, and there is also a restaurant attached to the motel :)",1
"We stay at this hotel every time we come to Columbia. It has a great location, great service and overall just a nice place to stay.",1
Pets are allowed. You do not know which rooms they allow Pets. I was awakened my first evening four times by two pit bulls barking beside me. Staff moved us to different room next day. Valet parking is too expensive. Rib Room prices are also too high. Rooms with a balcony are the way to go. Good Location for Hotel.,1
"My boyfriend and I had a most excellent stay here! We checked in on this past Sunday and stayed until this Tuesday. From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn",1

This place is like no other!! From the clean property to the friendly staff!!! I will stay here from now on! Love the breakfast and the putting green it's really beautiful!!

"The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one.",1
"Small town on the state route - unexpected delight with hotel room. Comfortable, clean and incredibly gorgeous view of the beach, water, sun. Nice to also have the picnic tables, hot tub. Access to town a breeze (because the town is so small). Parking is easy. Easy to find",1
"My visit to Hampton Inn Jackson, Tn was an awesome experience !! The customer service I received from the associates named Rufus Tonie were exemplary and at the highest standards of customer satisfaction. Everyone on staff went over above to make sure my stay was an excellent experience. I will definitely be staying at this location again.",1
"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our visit to Virginia last year. Check in was easy, front desk staff was friendly and helpful and spot on with their recommended spots to eat.

Is was amazing love everything on the hotel. We have the best 15 anniversary. We definitely go again.,1
"Built in 1898 this hotel has some charm. Priced like one of the new, right off the freeway type hotels, this one is special. Downtown, small old town with lots of history and plenty of good shopping and restaurants.",1
"This was our third stay at Bar Harbor Motel. It is always clean and comfortable. The grounds are lovely, The staff is always polite and helpful. Easy walk into the town center or a bus is available, We highly recommend this motel and will be returning.",1
"No complaints about quality of room. Breakfast was above average. Wifi was somewhat erratic, but that is so common these days it is almost not worth mentioning. The reason I dropped them a star is that they allowed 2 vehicles (cars with trailers) to remain in clearly marked fire lanes all night long. When I mentioned that to the front... More",1
"Good location and generally comfortable hotel, albeit somewhat cramped. Close to international restaurants of Silver Spring and short walk to Metro for access to all of DC. Room/hotel was clean and pleasant but showing age in some facilities. Friendly and helpful staff - very accommodating.",1

The overdone maritime theme makes this place creepy. Everything is painted dark blue--it's overwhelming and depressing.,0

As a visitor from the UK I was given all the help possible to enable me to get around the city in the short time that I had available. The rooms were all that I could have wished for. I arrived before check in time but that was no problemDear jameswZ268okbI am glad that we were there to help you enjoy this great city. I am also delighted that you enjoyed our rooms.Please do come back and see us again - this city still has lots more to seeRegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager,1
"Malgre 21Km de la plage le voyage se fait bien avec la voiture, hotel propre bon service, et petit dejeuner genereux Par contre les lits de ma chambre n'entaient pas confortables.",1
"Nice menu of american cuisine. Steaks, pasta, salads, chicken. Rueben and sweet potato fries were very good. Onion rings a little greasy. Chile very good. Nice crowd with families. Recommended. We will probably stop again.",1
I forgot the name for the lady serving/putting-out breakfast but she provided excellent customer service and that's hard to find now-in-days.,1

"Red Roof Inn, is nice and clean... They have reinavated their property. The rooms are nice... Great stay!!!!",1
"Hotel is clean, people are friendly, and it's convenient to both the local university and Palo Duro Canyon. Rooms are large and quiet, though the air conditioner makes some noise even at its lowest setting.",1
Bad: Valet is 30 and they do not tell you that. Good: Staff was incredibly friendly,1
"Having just returned from a week long vacation at the Honua Kai I am torn at what to say. The service was great, everyone person we encountered was very polite and very helpful and courteous. The rooms, lobby and gardens are very very clean and really beautiful. We had a Studio Ocean View and a 2 Bedroom Resort View. The... More",1
"My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week.",0
"What a great find right in the middle of all the action in Santa Monica ! I was only here for one night for work, but couldn't think of a better place for the money than here. Very eco-friendly, super-pleasant staff and clean, attractive accommodations. Pool area was great, there is a cantina restaurant very popular right on the property... More",1
We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!,1
"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary this past weekend. The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean and have a very welcoming vibe. The staff was extremely pleasant! Our room was clean, super cute and cozy. We had an adjoining room so we could hear the guest next door from time to time but it was not a bother what so ever. Overall our local get away was a much needed break from real life and this hotel provided the perfect space to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy the weekend.",1
"Awesome pool, comfy beds, pillows. Great view of downtown, and easy to get to plaza or to crown center.",1
I was very pleased with this hotel. will certainly stay here again. very convenient location to USC and the Staples Center in a nice hotel with exorbitant costs. free shuttle and parking a huge plus in this area. neighborhood is not amazing but where is in LA I didn't think neighborhood was as bad as many guests.,1
We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days. We needed the car once and it was brought to us in a timely manner. The staff was courteous and helpful. We were spoiled by everyone. Looking forward to staying at the Mills House again.,1
"This was our first stay at a Home 2 Suites hotel. The hotel was very modern, clean, and well kept. The entire staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The breakfast serving area could have been a little bigger to accommodate all of the individuals who were dining at the same time.",1
"I am staying at this hotel for business and it has exceeded expectations! Absolutely gorgeous, great location, superb amenities, super comfy bed.....I could go on and on. If you're visiting New Orleans STAY HERE.....you won't be disappointed!Jessie, Thank you for your great review on TripAdvisor. Your recommendation means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaire General Manager",1

Great room for the price. The Breakfast was awesome,1
Bad: The breakfast could have had more protein options. Good: Loved the room and the location,1
"Hotel is in a good location, just West of I-75 on the eastern edge of Tampa. In a very heavy retail area with just about any shopping or eateries very close by - probably want to drive to them as the Hotel is on Highway 60, a very wide road with traffic speeding recklessly by in both directions. Large, well-lit... More",0
"Great value and location, Club Quarters is walking distance to Main Street nightlife and half the price of nearby hotels. Valet parking is reasonably priced, property was clean and comfortable, and staff is very friendly. Will definitely stay here again!",1
Very nice hotel. Easy check in and out. Friendly staff. Very Clean room and if you want quiet ask to be on the south side of the building. Close to restaurants and shopping. Would definitely stay there again.,1
"Loved everything about it. Rustic feel, but 5-star comfort and great staff!! Will definitely visit again, next time for a longer stay. Not a great place to visit with little ones, but for a couples retreat it is fantastic. Thee was a wedding there when we visited and they dominated the Hilltop Pool (and they were very LOUD) so we...

"You get what you pay for. This was by far the cheapest hotel on this little island (connected by bridge). I was a great location for me because I had to go to a high-tech office also on that island. The wifi worked well. It was clean enough. The kitchen appliances are dated, but functional. The kitchen was not well... More",1
"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Wonderful! Especial nice for persons traveling with pets!,1
"Having travelled over the past 6 months, this hotel for a 3 star location was very disappointing. First the decor is very old, dark, and non-inviting. Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room.",1
"Easy check in. Every friendly staff. Checked in with my mother and hubby. Had a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were large. Beds and pillows comfortable. Gas fireplace in living room. Very clean and quite. Free parking and good breakfast.Emmausgirl, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay with us. We're so happy to know you had a great hotel experience, and we hope to welcome you back again!",1
"Asked for poolside room, non smoking... they gave me and my kids, two of whom have asthma, a smoking room. We were also charged 20 more than the previous stay for a much worse room. The room was clean but smelled terrible. The entire hallway smelled bad but the room was much worse. We will not be back. My advice... More",0
The front desk supervisor/manager was rude and not helpful at all. I asked for extra towels 3 times and never got them. The elevator took 10 minutes to come.,1
"We are a Men's Fellowship group that meet once a year at the Cooper Hill Inn, we have always enjoyed a warm reception and good food for our group that can number up to 24 individuals. Charles and Lee, the inn keepers, are gracious hosts and keep us well fed for the weekend.",1
"We stayed in 719 rented thru VRBO. The unit was perfect, seemed brand new and had all the extras you could need - hair dryer, beach chairs, aloe for your sunburn, etc. Resort and pools were busy because it was Easter week, but we always managed to find a spot. Loved having a condo so we could enjoy breakfast relaxing... More",1
"The hotel is very nice. A perfect spot for a romantic night away. I am a clean freak and it definitely passed all of my tests in the cleanliness department. The front desk staff was nice, check in and out took only a matter of minutes. The restaurant is amazing- the food is delicious. Overall it is a very nice... More",1
"Room was clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Convenient location. Good place for families, couples, or business travelers. Did miss not having a workout facility, though not a big deal. This was a 10,000 Marriott points hotel -- and we have stayed in 20,000 point places that were less than satisfying.",1
"Traveling on a budget and this fit the bill perfectly. The Dillon Motel has a lot of character, is in a marvelously central location and Mr. James is a great host. We stayed 4 nights in one of the newer, large rooms with 2 beds. Had a mini fridge and a microwave. Pool was closed but no complaints, this is... More",1
"The Holiday Inn Express is on the north side of town in an area with other hotels, some restaurants and some box stores. The receptionist was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Rooms have fridges, irons and TVs with a good selection of channels. Breakfast is included in the price. The bedroom was attractively furnished. The bathroom was a bit dowdy. But the hotel did what was needed - provide a safe and comfortable place to spend the night while on the road.",1
"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights during the Easter holidays, we found the staff very helpful, the reception area spacious, with comfortable seating, also an area with computers for guest use, however I found that they were always busy. We stayed in a Deluxe Corner King with Marina view, and it was well decorated, had a large comfortable... More",1

"Very pleasant and relaxing, breakfast was exceptional.",1
"This is a budget hotel which has been recently remodeled. No frills, small but clean and neat. We had a king size bed which had the most comfortable mattress of our entire trip! The sheets were crisp and clean, so relaxing after a long day of activities. The area was quiet and we had no safety issues. There is coffee in the lobby which was good. No other food or drink except vending machines, but numerous eating choices on the same street. There is no elevator, but we had a ground floor room, so this wasn't an issue for us. Overall a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. We would definitely stay there again.",1
"Near downtown sd, fashion shopping mall, easy access to highways. Beds semi comfortable. Fine for overnight lodging.",1
"Nice room, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was roomy with great shower head, shower curtain and granite countertop. They provide a coffee station, refrigerator and microwave. We will definitely stay here again while visiting family. One of the nicest Super 8's we have stayed.",1
"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.",0
We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge.,1
"The accommodations at the Hampton Inn and Suites were pleasant, but the hotel staff is amazing, friendly, and willing to ensure your stay is memorable. Everyone from the maid service to the front desk and general managers helped make the prolonged stay in the Fort Lewis, WA area as great experience as possible.",1
The facility was too old. But the front desk staff helped a lot.,1
Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service,1
The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately. The location was right next to the freeway onramp (noisy) and the neighborhood was sketchy. I will not stay here again.,0
"This hotel was good in all respects. The only complaint I can think of was the heating system in the room was a little too noisy. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The breakfast was great, and the room was very comfortable. No complaints other than the one I first mentioned. You will like staying here.",1
Bad: Rude staff. Couldnt find our reservations waited 2 hrs to confirm eventhough prepaid..rooms not cleaned. Got smoking instead of non smoking. Will not be staying there anytime soon not. Good: Location,0
"The website looked great, the pictures and description and the cert. of exc. from TripAdvisor and, at the time 4.5 stars led me to choose this. But when we got here the place was so very different from what we expected. We paid 357 per night, and felt it was really more of a 150 - 200 per night place.... More",1
Bad: Did not like the breakfast.,1
"We find this Best Western a pleasant place to stop on our way home from Ms. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. They enlarged the Breakfast room which made it less crowded to enjoy our breakfast, which is very good and we will stay there again.",1
If you stay at Holiday Inn Express locations regularly you will be happy to find this property to be one of the good ones. Nothing about it feels overdue for updating or replacing. My pregnant wife enjoyed using the pool after 8 hours of driving. We usually stay with Holiday Inn and occasionally are disappointed to find a poorly kept... More,1
"This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean. Soft bed, clean bedding, modern decor, kitchen with all necessities and clean bathroom. If I return definitely coming back here.",1
"For a very small town out in the middle of nowhere, you will not find anything better. In fact, it is above average, even compared with its big city counterparts. Clean, well-maintained and comfortable. That's all we ask. The breakfast was the weakest link, but that has become standard for pretty much every place that offers the routine continental fare.",1
"The only negative was it was supposed to be a non smoking room and as soon as I opened the door you could only smell cigarettes. The hotel was just an exceptional value. I have never tried the Hampton before, but, I will definitely return.",1
"We stayed here in April and fell in love with the property. A year ago we stayed at the Westin Kanaapali Ocean Resort and wanted to go back there but nothing was available. We were just as happy at the Honua Kai as at the Westin! The grounds are gorgeous, there's plenty of pools, pool side service and of course,... More",1
Very clean and comfortable property. Has everything you need for business and pleasure. Great amenities for the traveler. Before and after work buffet is very accommodating and enjoyable. Staff is Top Notch !!! Very friendly and attentive to the guest needs. Will be my CdA Home Away from Home !!!,1
We stayed in a 4 bedroom condo with spectacular ocean views! The resort was clean and very welcoming! We were celebrating my youngest sister's monumental 40th Birthday and the concierge helped us organize to have a local company deliver a gourmet cake and gorgeous lei prior to our arrival. The staff was absolutely amazing! The pools were clean and very... More,1
"Bad: More comfortable seating in the breakfast area. Good: Excellent location, really convenient for exploring Boston and close to the underground for travelling to the airport. Comfortable room and convenient breakfast facilities.",1
Wow I should have listened to the other reviews. We just needed a place to stay for one night and we thought we would give this place a chance after hearing it was recently remodeled. The smell when you walked in the halls was horrible and dirty smelling. It became even worse when we entered our room. The bathroom smelled... More,0
"Nous avons eu un superbe sejour ! La decoration, la proprete, le dejeuner la piscine, tout y etait pour faire plaisir a une jeune famille en transit.",1
The hotel staff was helpful on information about DC and times the shuttle was a 10 minute ride from the hotel. The hotel is not new but had a nice indoor pool to rest in after a long day of sight seeings.,1
We stayed for our 25th wedding anniversary and the room was great. Huge bed and very comfy. The room was clean and everyone was so nice. You get free drinks and food at 5:30 which I thought was great. It was a wonderful stay and we will definatly visit again.,1
When I first arrived at this motel I did not realize what I was getting my self into the first night was ok no major problems no more than to be expected from a motel right next to a bar. Although after the time I had to live there 2 months I found out that the sewer backs up into... More,0
Very good service and accommodation.,1
"The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night. The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening. Our room was very clean. The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub. Although the hotel is not in Newport, it is a straight drive right into the town.",1
"This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes.",1
"We loved this hotel! The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The food in the restaurant was delicious, and our grandchildren were given special attention and treats. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable.",1
"Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there.",1
"Spent a few nights in Bend and this place was fantastic. The location is right near the Old Mill district on the river which is a great spot. There are plenty of places to eat, shops and cinemas all within a stones throw. I believe you can hire bikes and ride along the river as well. The location isn't too... More",1
The breakfast was very good. The beds were quite hard. Enjoyed our stay though and would stay there again.,1
"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.",1
"Everything was 5 star! Beautiful granite, exceptional bed and a quiet night.",1
Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future.,1

Traveling with our High School Varsity Girls Basketball team to a Holiday Tournament this past weekend in Boise I spent two nights at the Oxford Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly.

I stayed for one night for business. The front desk staff was friendly. Room was clean. Tv worked. Free wifi. Clean shower. Not much more I needed since I was only there to sleep for 6 hours.,1
"Really enjoyed the stay. Great breakfast to get the day started, then out for the day, came back after dinner, then went in the pool and hot tub to relax and wrap up the day.",1
Very nice property. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Only thing that could be changed is to have handicap spaces by all entrances,1
"If your looking for a 5 star hotel keep looking the chair was stained. If your looking for a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced room with a comfortable bed. Here's the place. Great location to restaurants for any type you could want. Little hard to find because it's behind a convience store and a Dairy Queen.",1
"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff.",0

Also, less than 5... More",1
"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.",1
Front lobby area with beverages was almost always disheveled. Bar area too. Breakfast was disorganized. Food was good though. Pool was nice feature but there was an ant issue in there. There were multiple ants on me when I got up to my room. Mattress felt lumpy but we slept ok. Room was a comfortable size.,1
"The hotel was older than the website showed it to be,overall was pleased with stay.",1
"When travelling to see family, we've taken to stopping near our destination the night before to give the kids the opportunity to swim and unwind from the long trip instead of showing up cranky and tired from driving. It has really worked out for us. Our 'normal' hotel had a problem with their pool, so we chose to stay at... More",1
Bad: The room was really small for a family of 6. Good: The staff is really friendly,1
"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.",0
"The room itself was as expected. I had no disappointments with the accommodations. The bus service to the strip was an added bonus. Unfortunately, we had a room closest to the IH-15 and facing towards the Las Vegas Strip and Las Vegas Airport. I didn't sleep very well due to the departing airplanes and the shrieks from the patrons riding the roller coaster at the New York, New York hotel. I suggest asking for a room facing away from the strip.",1
"We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was very clean and very comfortable. WiFi was free. There was an onsite computer for guest use. Breakfast was adequate. Coffee was good. The hotel, considering the room rate and proximity to ammenities, and cleanliness, it cannot be beat.",1
"Very friendly, a true honest friendly. Nice room. Fantastic breakfast. Very clean. It is not a chain hotel so maybe that is why the employees seem happy. That is a good reason to stay here. Easy to get to from the freeway.",1
"I am away from my home several months at a time. When I stay in St. Louis the Hampton is my home, the staff my family. I always get a friendly, happy, warm greeting from everyone on the Staff. Stay and you won't go away unhappy.",1
Hotel was easy to find. I could see the top of Mt Rainier out our window. Room was clean and comfortable. Front desk staff were polite and very helpful (to the hotel: I did find my glasses sun clip that I thought I lost in the car but thank you for keeping an eye out for them!!). The two gals... More,1
"I recently spent two nights at the Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue in Seattle. Great Location - but I felt the Hyatt House was a bit disappointing. It began with the check-in early Sunday evening. Two Hyatt Housers were on the desk - but only one working intake. I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in. Next was the size of the room - extremely small even for the room type. Next was the food service in the bar - absolutely the worst burnt cheeseburger I have had in quite a while accompanied by 16 broken potato chip pieces and a cupcake which was advertised to be scrumptiously fancy (it was not - it was plain awful and dry). Next was the shower - no water pressure (and this is a relatively new hotel). One of the better highlights was breakfast, while selection was limited - the food was good.Hyatt Houses are usually outstanding - evidently I caught the Seattle Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue during a underperforming period.ZAismy2ndHome,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge",1
"I was very pleased with my stay. My only compliant was that the waffle batter was extremely watery. Other then that, breakfast was really good. I also loved how this hotel offered so many amenities. Even though, I did not get a chance to use the fitness room, the business center, pool and spa were all very nice. I loved... More",1
Free breakfast is an added perk however the same food 3 days in a row i couldn't face cheese omelets and sausage for the 3rd day so i ate out. a little variety here would be nice. also check out is 11 am. housekeeping was knocking on my door at 8:30. i felt like i was being rushed out. room was super clean and spacious. the location of the hotel is excellent.,1
"I must say that the hotel met my standards of comfort, space but cleanliness was not so good. The housekeeping staff must be retrained and maybe the hotel should hire dedicated people to clean rooms thoroughly. I found 2 bags of trash in the cabinet from previous tenants (SURPRISED FACE)and the shower curtain was in poor condition. This discovery made me feel that the hotel staff zips in and out rooms, and not cleaning properly.",1
good,1
In heart of downtown. Older hotel with front steps that you needed to have bell service for. Breakfast good but expensive. Parking nearby for a fee. Free coffee am only. needs grab bars in bath.,1
I found my room + hotel to be just as advertized. Tnhe location puts you in easy walking distance of Wrigley Field.It is also very handy to both bus and L.,1
Room was adequate and clean.Good location in center of town. Front desk was very unfriendly. His child son was more helpful . Breakfast was a joke. Coffee and juice. There are better choices to be had in Cedar City.,1
"Nice and well kept, close to bike trails and dining",1
"First of all, the owner manager both are very rude. The room I stayed in was not that clean when I first checked in. There was and probably still is writing on the walls.

"Stayed there for just one overnight. The room I got smelled like a smoker room, even though apparently it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. This property has a long way to go be modernized. The rooms are antiquated and need a serious freshening. The safe in my room was missing the lock entirely. The shower/water closet room was... More",1
"Staff pleasant, hard to find",1
"Clean, nothing fancy hotel. Only one bed in room. Right on busy highway, so some traffic noise. Great benefit of being across highway from shuttle bus to park. Good value for price compared to other hotels in area.",1
"From our huge, beautifully appointed room to the exquisite pool with a view, the London Hotel was nothing short of spectacular. The mosaic bathroom (with a gigantic shower), the inner lit wardrobe and an abundance of mirrors throughout the light and airy suite were all very much to my liking. The staff were friendly and the only gripe would be... More",1
"The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge.",1
This hotel exceeded all my expectations. It is conveniently located and a short drive to everything San Diego has to offer. Marcia and Elisa at the front desk were incredibly helpful and friendly making my stay all the better. They went out of their way to answer any questions and make recommendations as to what to see. Thanks again!,1
"The hotel is poorly maintained, common areas like elevators were unkept, the breakfast was poor and in a bad location, and there was an infestation of bedbugs. The manager refused to talk to us even after two calls.",0
I stayed here with my daughter and grandson during the the first weekend the festival. We found the room very clean and the beds very comfortable.

"Everything was great except when we discovered that the cleaning person was putting back dirty towels we placed on the floor, back on the rack. Now I questioned if the bed linens and anything else was actually cleaned. We are deeply disappointed that she would do such a mean and unsanitary act. overall, the other staff were helpful and pleasant.",1
The staff was amazing. The toom was a nice size. We had a king sized bed with a pullout sofa so 4 can sleep comfortably,1
Had a great 2 night stay. Janie took real good care of my faxes and checkout process. Will definitely stay again. They had a nice breakfast buffet. A comfortable looking exercise facility. A good sized pool. Relatively close to a nice restaurant and Walmart and Mejer shopping centers.,1
"Spent 3 nights. Very large rooms and full kitchen that is separate from the bedroom which is important, since you do not hear the refrigerator. On Wednesday, Oct. 21 they had all you can eat complimentary pizza.",1

"The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food.",1
Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time.,1
The staff was top notch. From the desk manager to the cleaning ladies everyone was friendly and eager to help. Great attitudes. The WiFi was slow and eventually just turned back to 4G. The Breakfast was a get there early thing but it was free. The rooms were not new but everything was clean. And you had a good choice of walk to live music from the hotel.,1
"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon.",1

I hope you have already started thinking about your next trip to Key West, because we are looking forward to your next visit. Thank you for all the kind words.",1
Bad: The actual pricing of the hotel was different from when i booked it . Good: The starbucks and how there was a gym and pool .,1
Our normal hotels were booked and our only choice was Americas Best Value Inn. First impression was Shocking. IT started with a walk all the way around the Hotel to the back by the bowling alley.

This hotel is a block from the inner harbor in the middle of everywhere.,1
Hotel room had great view. Was clean. Chic. And accommodating. However the air conditioning kept my partner from sleeping well that night. We stayed on 20 floor and in July Kansan heat he got hot. When we arrived the fridge was warm and barely cooled off our food.,1
"I was only here for one night before a cruise and it could not have been better. The room was small, but clean and the staff could not have been more accommodating.

Bad: Hassle checking in confirmation email lost by bookings or Fremont hotel had my email almost didn't use mine scary .,1
"I've never been to a hotel where I had to pay to park in the facilty. 36 a night was ridiculous, the food tasted like it was for a school breakfast, the hotel for being in the downtown area looked worst than any hood I ever was in. They removed more money than they were supposed to thinking I wasn't going to notice, I was supposed to get a discount rate and they tried not to apply it. The pool and the fitness room was cool. the hotel was clean.",0

We found ourselves without a room and driving from Philadelphia to Virginia over Memorial Day weekend.

I made reservations online through the Wyndham rewards website and when I got to the hotel the desk clerk informed me that he would have given me a better rate but since I booked online he couldn't change anything.

I have been all over the island and no one does a better Mai tai. I stopped at a exclusive resort restaurant that charged 16.00 for thier Mai tai's and they were a little weak. They have great happy hour prices and maintain a tasty Mai tai with a punch.,1
We are quite happy with our choice. The receptionists are generally friendly and helpful. We found it convenient to have a courtesy van. The breakfast is very good.,1
"The hotel is a bit dated and worn, but not terribly so. It is, however, located on the beach with Miami Beach's boardwalk directly behind the hotel. In the center of Miami Beach. Bed was comfortable and room nicely appointed, just needs a little updating. Good value. Some rooms have terraces and ocean views - again, at a good value.... More",1
Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum. Great area restaurants. Nice caf shop on the ground floor.,1

"Location great. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Room great. Staff very helpful. Lee, the lovely lady who first saw us when we booked in couldn't have been more helpful. She gave us lots of information about Seattle and was extremely friendly and helpful. Lee went above and beyond in customer service.",1
"The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss. Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable.

"We spent 3 days at this hotel, whilst at a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and at Disneyland. Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review. I am glad to hear that Adi and our team were able to give you 5 star service during your visit to Anaheim.I hope to see you on our next Disneyland Adventure!

This time the stool did not work properly and did not have hot water in the morning. Couple of times have had to switch rooms because of leaking water problems. Was great but seems to keep having problems.",1
"No Manager's reception which I missed. But good service for the value you pay. Most Best Westerns have a reception offering a glass of wine or beer and some food. This is a wonderful feature, especially when traveling on your on and you want to have some conversation.",1
"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.",0
"We stayed 3 nights. Our first night was awful, the bed was very uncomfortable. My husband asked if we could be moved into another room the next day, we knew they were fully booked, and the front desk man told us all the beds are the same and they never got complaints about the beds. VERY RUDE. Well the next... More",1

Bad: Nothing. Good: Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of the facility was also great. We have stayed at the Westin a few times and will continue in the future.,1
The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix.,1

Nothing Very friendly staff and very helpful,1
The staff was very friendly and the hotel was spotless! Nice morning breakfast!,1
Our room was handicapped accessible yet was located in the most obscure corner of the building on the third floor as far from the elevators as one could get. Seems kind of strange. Check-in process was fast and smooth with no issues room was clean comfortable and everything we needed.,1
I was here for a business trip. I could not believe the cleanliness and size of the room. Good staff and breakfast as well,1
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather",1
"We recently stayed at Days Inn, Apple Valley, Sevierville, TN for 4 nights and had no problems and if did staff took care off. Emily and maintenance man are the best as is the rest of the staff who are for the most part. Convenient location-close to everything and get what you pay for. We'll be back next year.",1
We had dinner at a wonderful restaurant and unfortunatly the waiter spilled wine on my friends white jacket and pants. They sent the clothing the cleaners that night . stains remained but they replaced everything. Golf was amazing Can't wait to return next year for gofl lessons with Harry. We stayed at the villa's and the were so amazing,1

Decent hotel if you could get it for the right price. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for families. Great for young people on a budget,1

Very comfortable beds, air conditioning, satellite TV, free wifi, ample parking, kitchenettes, restaurant/bar nearby, perfect for the 2 months we stay every year!",1
"My friend and I stayed here last Friday (2 July). First off, we were told the public facilities were unavailable due to work being done in the hall (wallpaper going up). We were assigned our room and it was 1 bed. So went back down and said it was supposed to be 2 beds. We were issued another room (318)... More",0
"The only complaint I have about this hotel is that my sink was stopped up, but they did come and fix it right away. The toilet was running and continues until our stay, but that didn't bother me too much. They were repaying the parking lot and didn't have it posted anywhere and with them having the bar downstairs you had to park way over by the other building and walk to the hotel.",1
We had a great stay. Had to stay at this hotel after checking into and out of a different hotel due to issues at the property. We should have just found this hotel first and stayed here. Front desk staff was very nice. Breakfast attendant could have been a little sunnier. We would stay at this property if ever back... More,1
"Hands down definitely the worst Best Western I've stayed!!! Don't know if previous people or cleaning person left balcony door open But the room had at least 5 mosquitoes buzzing around, fortunately I managed to get 3. A slight musty odor like a old wet towel throughout room. Luckily we only stayed 1 night if it weren't for the ocean view we would have literately fought for money back! So if your on a budget this is it!!!",1
Nice,1
"Bad: Breakfast was not appetizing, eggs were very cold, toaster very old and didn't work very wellonly had one breakfast meat some people don't eat pork should always have two meats. Dining room very dated needs upgrades. Good: Rooms were excellent and very comfortable.",1
"Overall, the room and service were of a good quality. However, management recently changed the cash payment policy, thereby adding a 250 refundable cash deposit, which was not listed on the website for this particular location. Since we were returning to Canada, we needed to spend our American currency first and this created a slight check-in problem, which was handled quite efficiently by the clerk.",1

The valet... More",1
"I thought it would be nicer than best western or comfort inn, since it's by Sheraton but it's not. The room size is about the same, I got double beds. There's no free breakfast. There's not much establishment around the area. Better go to downtown San Jose. It's still a nice clean hotel with comfy bed and pillows. I'd still recommend it because it's affordable. Maybe I expected too much.",1
"There were stink bugs on the curtains! The front desk was somewhat quick to come remove one or two. But by the end of the night, I had removed three myself. The complimentary breakfast was typical, although I would have enjoyed some toppings for the oatmeal. No one bothered to clear the entrance/exit driveway, which is a steep hill, after 6 inches of snow. There was no other hotel close enough to move to, as I was there for business.",1
We check in at 10 pm and the AC on the room was broken then we find out that no water at the hotel. They chenge the room for us but with out water untill 3 am. The pillows and matress are terrible.,0

"Good value compared to the hotels downtown DC. Good room, and good service.",1
"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends",1

"The new Best Western Plus motels are my favorite! Modern decor... Very clean... Your normal free breakfast. They seem to be even better quality then some holiday Inn expresses. Highly recommend, it was a real treat.",1
"Went to the Memorial Day Celebration at the Texas State Cemetery like we do every year!! Close, with a Huge Room and Great Staff, KK Donuts in the Hotel Parking Lot, Good Pool and Great Breakfast as Well!",1
The staff here was so nice and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. I would recommend staying here if I was in the area. The fitness room is very small so if it is booked you may have to wait for equipment.,1
"Good: Structure, room",1
"We needed a room for one day after surgery and having to return to the hospital the next day so Aloft was closest! To our pleasant surprise the staff was above and beyond accommodating from Tevin in Valet department to Misia and Tatyanna front desk! Thank you so much! Linda, Hopefully the surgery was as successful as the as your visit to our hotel. We do have the BEST STAFF and are grateful for their efforts. Tatyanna, Misha and Tevin will be cheered and celebrated for your shout out. Thank you for recognizing their efforts. Heal fast, then come back and have some fun!Evan",1
Great place right in the middle of the north end. Literally on Hanover street Room was clean and looked brand new. There is no parking so we stayed at haymarket garage and walked 5 minutes. Check in at restaurant,1
"A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price.",1
"The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and a decent size for VA Beach. It was off-season, but everything was still fine. I think they are renovating the other side of the building, but our side was business as usual. The heated pool was a bonus!",1
"The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time.",1
Spent two nights good service and nice room. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was wonderful.,1
"Good location - close to shopping and airport. Comfortable and clean enough, but does need renovation. Good value for the price.",1
"The bed was very comfortable, however the iron did not work properly and water seeped out of the bottom of the iron. Water drained from the bottom of the shower and I had to put towels on the floor around the shower to prevent falling. The room was dusty, the colors in the room were not inviting or appealing. I think a complimentary brunch would have been nice. If you are going to put coffee makers in the rooms at least give the customer something to stir the hot coffee.",1
"Stayed at the Hampton Inn and I must say, everything was awesome! My room was cleaned beautifully and actually smelled fresh! The staff here is really great polite, friendly, helpful - great customer service. All in all, a truly positive hotel experience.",1

it was nice good location the staff was friendly and very helpful,1
"This place should be closed. It is dirty and un-safe. Upon check-in, the woman at the desk said she required credit card or cash payment up front (should of been our first clue this place a disaster) She would not hold payment until our check-out like other hotels. When we got to our room, what we found was outrageous. The... More",0

"We came here for our anniversary and booked a spa suite, it took the water 15 minutes to get warm and once it was warm 10 minutes later you were blasted with cold water. We called down to the front desk to ask for more pillows because they fell flat as soon as your head hit them the employee at... More",0
"The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby.",1
"Good: Position, building, room design and comfort, rooftop pool",1
"We stayed here the night before our cruise departed. The rooms are far from the office, pool and breakfast room. Rooms are a bit small but clean. Breakfast was good but crowded. The front office seemed to be understaffed for the volume of visitors.",1
We had the most amazing stay! Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need. Our time at the pool (conveniently we got roomed on the same floor as the pool) was amazing and much needed. Breakfast was... More,1

"Good: Staff, location, rooms and pool were alll first class. Shuttle bus was free to the parks and reliable. This hotel would be my first choice every time.",1
The room was not well maintained. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been swept or cleaned in a while. The room looked like it never had a real deep cleaning. The Towels in the bathroom where a grungy gray. It is not a well kept property. The breakfast pantry had a foul odor coming from it. I realize that... More,0

"Made reservation for room with roll-in shower, with a bench/chair to use - there was no bench/chair available.

"Overall, the rooms are pretty nice, but my experience this time was not. First, I requested wake-up calls at 6:30 and 6:40 AM. I didn't get either.

"My first visit in 2016 and the Westin's staff continues to provide excellent service. They are genuinely willing to accommodate a guest's request. I enjoy my visits to Greenville but along with a wonderful downtown, great restaurants, beautiful Reedy river it's made complete by returning to the Pointsett to relax and enjoy the down time.",1

"As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests.

"Stayed here June 2016. Staff was amazing. Love this hotel. This was our 2nd time here. Very clean hotel, looks fairly new too. Our room had fridge, microwave, Keurig too. Great location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Will definitely be back.",1
What I needed for a working trip,1
All new renovated hotel!! Great prices. Excellent staff!! A little tough to get to on the back roads but well worth it!,1
Hotel was everything we needed. Feel kinda bad for the two women who were running the breakfast room - they were a bit overburdened at times. But they marched on with smiles and a good attitude - but especially with some items being made to order - they could use one more hand!,1
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,0
Hotel room was dirty after sleeping on pillow case observed a blood stain. Shower was awful.,1
"The rooms, service, location, staff, and breakfasts were perfect. And the pool was unbelievably enticing despite its (or maybe because of its) unusual location!",1
Bad: breakfast is normal. Good: I am very satisfied this hotel.,1
Overall the hotel was pleasant and staff were helpful and friendly. The amenities were excellent. They breakfast was well prepared and kept fresh. The hotel lounge/bar was nice and provided a relaxing atmosphere. The pool was nice and they even had a small basketball court. I would advise to request a room facing the pool and/or away from the interstate... More,1
"Staff welcomed, room sharp crisp quiet clean and all ready to go. Convenient access. Upon check in I was able to get a discount using on line booking which the staff advised me of. When I was given a HUGE room and wanted a little smaller they jumped to it. Note, rooms like 110, 210 .. get a lot of... More",1
This hotel offers great service and friendly staff. I always get a good nights sleep here. I find the rooms to be comfortable and clean. Breakfast always has a good variety and is fresh. I often stay at this location when visiting Tyler..,1
"Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub.

Unfortunately one was missing. It was 1am so very bad surprise.... More",1

"It was a wonderful stay however for some reason money was transferred out of my bank account towards this hotel for 86 and nobody knew why which was disappointing. However, the stay was great.",1
"Really friendly staff. Room was very clean and comfortable. Only slightly negative thing to add, I had to wake up the sleeping overnite front desk personel when I was checking out in the morning!",1
"Great Room! We came to Scottsdale to sight see, service was great, Front desk, house keeping and the Bistro( Mauro and Ed were great) went out of there way to make us feel comfortable! Hotel is very Quiet.",1
"Picked this hotel because it was advertised as the host hotel for a dog show/obedience trial. Since dogs have to be taken out regularly, attendees of course wanted rooms on the ground floor. Management assigned a block of rooms where everyone had to go either up or down stairs to get outside. Keep in mind, most of these people are... More",0
Bad: Was a little too far to walk to the strip. Good: Bartender was awesome got complimentary drinks at bar. Very clean.,1
We had a power outage and had to think quickly. I went online and saw this hotel. The staff was great. The young man was training someone when we walked in but made us feel very welcomed.,1
Second time staying at this property. Beautiful setting. Cottage experience makes you feel like your home away from home. The private patios with heaters and outdoor showers are a treat. All the dining venues are delicious.,1
"When I booked this room, I knew there was a separate living area, but had no idea of the real size of the place. It was huge for a hotel room. There is a little kitchenette and dining area with nice appliances and a great set up. Then there the living area, that could be converted into another sleeping area.... More",1
On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.,1
"The location for this hotel is great right in the middle of the North End and close walking distance to Faneuil Hall, etc. modern efficient with large TV and electric fireplace. Very nice bathroom with standup shower but lacking in horizontal surfaces for toiletries.",1
Nice to visit one of the old time motels (motor-hotels) which were the only type of lodgings found along the smaller highways of North America during the 50's and 60's before the interstates and bigger hotel chains came in and destroyed the tourist economies of America's small towns. A quiet location despite its proximity to the highway and quaint with... More,1
Bad: I booked this property for their GAME ROOM IT WAS CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE EVENT!!! That was very dissapointing because I was with teenagers that could not be in the bar area and needed something to do. I thought it was wrong to advertise a game room that is continously not available because of private party's. And I stayed on a Thursday I'm sure it's worse on the weekends. Good: The renovation looks great. The bar downstairs is great with late night food.,1
The rooms are standard motel rooms but extremely clean and well maintained. The location is great for fishing or rafting on the east branch of the Delaware River. Plus it is easy to get to the West Branch or the Beaverkill,1
Good: The staff was fantastic and amazingly helpful.,1
"Bad: Not clean, nothing worked, noisy, old and worn-out. Good: Nothing",0
"The Best Western Old Mill has been renovated and looks much nicer than previous years. The rooms were nice and clean, but were very small and crowded with furniture. The pool was just okay and there were no clean towels. The hot tub was lukewarm the entire time we were there and there was THICK ring of mold around the top of the hot tub.",1
"The lobby is nicer than a Motel 6 but everything else is Motel 6, well, except the price... Motel 6 costs about 1/4th of the price of the Courtyard Marriott. This Courtyard even has the standard motel polyester comforters (white but still polyester). The staff were nice. I enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard but was expecting more than the... More",0
"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning.",0
The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything,1
"Hotel was nice. Had to ask for towels. Room were cleaned late in day. Came back from beach and no clean towels. Wifi cost extra, parking was 35/day to hand them my keys. No complimentary breakfast. Not a 4 star experience. Stayed at a Marriott last year, much better",1
"Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. Please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!Sarah Junge",1

Bad: Non smoking rooms smelt like smoke and just all the cigerate smoke throughout hotel. And room drains slow draining. Good: I liked the lanai restaurant and valet parking,1

Good: Perfect hotel,1

We have stayed at the Tarpon Inn Dozens of times over the years with the latest being Valentines Weekend. It is a historical site for sure.

"When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into.",1
"Great place to stay.....for such a great rate I did not think that the hotel would be very nice...but, I was wrong it was very nice. It was clean, quiet and the beds were the most comfortable I have experienced at a hotel.",1

I've stayed here several times and am always pleased with my stay.,1
"Overall the hotel is clean with a helpful staff and a great free breakfast - it was a very good experience. However some of the small things were missed...

"Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area.",1

Stayed 3 nights and it served my purpose well. Only returned at night to sleep. Ate the breakfast 1 time and it was ok. Coffee was good and that's important. The king bed was very worn. Could almost feel the springs. Time to replace the mattress for sure. Housekeeping did a good job. I had friends that stayed at a... More,1
Room 116 was a nice sized room with a couch and a king bed. The only downside was that it was basement level. Our window looked out to the knees of passer-by's which meant that we had to keep the blinds closed or people would look down into our room. Zero privacy. Otherwise the hotel was nice and the staff did a good job. No complaints.,1
"I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities. By the time I knew that they weren't in the cabinets, it was late and I didn't feel like bothering to request any.",1

"Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice.",1
"This motel is right on the main strip in Cherokee and easy to get in and out of. The front desk was always pleasant and facilities were clean and well maintained. We stayed in a king suite and the room was clean and the bed comfortable. We didn't partake of the included breakfast, but it looked like your usual motel... More",1
"Everything was clean and fresh - check in went very well. Breakfast and evening meals were good. However, I ordered in food to my room on Tuesday night and the tray with leftover food was still sitting at my door on Wednesday night. Gross - that has never happened to me at a Hilton Property. I can't stand to see... More",1
"The hotel was generally clean, well maintained, comfortable beds, towels at poolside, breakfast buffet reasonably stocked. However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon.",1
"Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location.",1
"Staff were very helpful and the motel is very nice. Modern, quality gym, good breakfast and the staff work hard to please customers. I will stay here again this was a pleasant experience. The manager made sure we had what we needed for getting laundry done in the middle of our vacation. You could tell he was involved with the... More",1

This is a good place to go if you're just there for a night and you've spent all your money on Hamilton tickets. It's very close to the theater and was the price was nice compared to other hotels nearby. Very kind of them to have water bottles and water stations by the elevators.Dear ifitsnotbaraqueNice to read that we were there to help you enjoy Hamilton. We always have great deals and complimentary amenities leaving more to be spent on enjoying this great cityCome see us again soonKind regardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager,1
"I am native to New Orleans, but live elsewhere currently, so I KNOW EXACTLY where to stay when visiting.

The hotel has entrances on both Royal (cafes, galleries, boutiques) and Chartres (Jackson Square), so it is central to EVERYTHING in... More",1
"Great Hotel, wonderful location and good shops and GREAT restaurants (not just fast-food) within walking distance! Easy drive to the beaches and to 'outlet-shops' if you wish. Away from the crowds closer to LA.",1
"I have stayed at this hotel many times and never a problem. Always have an enjoyable stay. The hotel is situated right near the boardwalk, the outlets to shop and the casinos of course all within walking distance and if you want to take the Jitney, the stop is right in front of the hotel.",1
Nice place to spend the night. Very close to car rental.,1
Went for a couple of nights with my wife and our 3 kids and all of us came back home with wonderful memories. We really enjoyed having the opportunity to BBQ our own dinner and enjoying our meal on the magnificent patio. Rooms and all amenities very very clean.,1
We recently visited Bardstown for a birthday celebration. We were interested in checking out the Bourbon trail. It just happened to be Derby weekend!

"Bad: Even tough considered an exlusive hotel it is quite expensive for what you get and the hotel parking is way too expensive. The TV location in the room is a bit forced and not so comfortable from all angles. Good: Fantastic location, great personal attention from the staff. Very clean.",1
Bad: Noise!!! in the room you can hear the noise from the corridor and from neighboring rooms.,1
Booked a room last min under promotion. Came with free breakfast. Nice hotel.,1
Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!,1

Our first impression of the hotel was a little sad. The front entry is very plain and not well lit. The lobby was clean and decorated nicely as was the room we stayed in. It smelled fresh and clean.

"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

Comfortable and clean room and bathroom. Delicious breakfast. Perfect location for our activities along the river with its newly constructed river walk. Renovation of this building in art-deco style is superb -- enjoying the architectural design is part of the experience. Highly recommend this Hampton Inn.,1
"Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again.",1
"The rooms are luxurious, the staff are very accommodating, and the casino is not overly crowded. Best of all, the beds are insanely comfy!! The best stay we've had in all the times we've been to Vegas. We will always stay here from now on.",1
"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price .",0
"I was extremely impressed with how Stephanie handled my check-in at this Hotel Also, the checkout clerk was Awesome, as well...She was very friendly at time of check out... Great Service!! Loved the room and the setup... Sergio",1
Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.,1
This place was loud and had the most awkward set up. It made it very difficult to rest. Disney on 4 hours of sleep kinda sucks. The place was pretty clean.,0

We stayed at the SpringHill Suite Norfolk Old Dominion University for our daughter's graduation. Upon check in we were told that even though we had prepaid our room or so we thought that Old Dominion SpringHill Suites didn't actually charge us. We were ok with that. We checked in Shaneel at the front desk was amazing. An asset to the... More,0
"We stayed here for one night while attending a Braves game. The room was clean, bed was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great having easy access to 285, restaurants/shops close by and the MARTA station is just a short drive away. We will defiantly stay here again.",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions,0
"This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience.",1
"Don't expect anything other than a fairly decent place to sleep. When we checked in, the two coffee pots were empty. We asked for another pillow and were told one would be sent to the room. We never got it. There is no tissue (Kleenex) and don't expect complimentary shampoo and conditioner. In the morning when we checked out, the coffee pots were still empty. Having said all that, the room was clean and bed was pretty comfortable. Bathroom was clean and shower was hot so if that's what you are looking for, you will be satisfied.",1
"We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire. The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins! The TV was extremely tiny compared to any other hotel I've stayed at and my 6'2 husband had a hard time taking in shower in the tiny space. Wouldn't stay here again due to the uncomfortable room.",1
"i loved the deck looking over the pigeon river so relaxing, can walk everywhere - it was the best",1
"We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon.",0
"This little motel has the attraction of a difficult entrance depending on the direction you're coming from and some very unprofessional employee's, though they did allow smoking in the rooms which was a plus, I woke up the next morning to my car having signs of an attempt of being broken into. Poor security in the parking lot, minimal cameras.... More",0
Elsah is charming. The inn is a very short walk from the river and a view of the bluffs. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. The inn keeper gave us coupons for wine at the Grafton Winery and Restaurant where we enjoyed the sunset over the Mississippi. Breakfast was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed another night!,1
"Recently spent 1 night based somewhat on other's reviews on Trip Advisor. Hotel was clean, staff friendly. Free Breakfast was a disappointing collection of frozen waffles, prepackaged muffins, bulk cereals, etc. No fruit, yogurts, or proteins. While rooms may be No Smoking sidewalks are fair game which defeats purpose of no smoking.",1
Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working. As well on two of the five nights the fire alarm went off with no voice commands over the intercom. The fire doors would close automatically and during the week... More,0
"Nice check in and out fast. The pool area, like the frosted glass but if more than three double rooms go to the pool it exceeds its capacity. I never like this in new hotel due size but that's part the flag standards. The hallways smell like nasty feet, no so much the rooms. Breakfast was to standards and knowing... More",1
"The room was adequate but not anything else. I stayed here because it was the only room I could get because of a Jazz Fest at the Hampton Coliseum. The rate was about 2.5 times the regular room rate definitely not worth the price, but I had no choice.",1

"This seems like a great value when compared with other area hotels, but it's worth the extra drive to Spokane Valley or Coeur d'alene. The rooms are large, but very dark and old. It smells old and musty. There seemed to be plenty for the kids to do though a swimming pool, arcade, etc. The night staff was friendly, but... More",0

The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi.

We stopped at the Drury Inn on June 24th for a night as we headed to South Carolina. The Drury Inn was a pleasant surprise.

"When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did",0

We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West.",1
Bad: No casino.,1
"Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident.",1
My wife and I have stayed in several Motel 6s this year and this one is mostly average with the exception that it has a microwave and refrigerator which is a big plus.

The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out.,1
"My family and I stayed here for a night, the front desk guy and girl that were there are super nice they treated us with a warm smile and made us feel at home! . Awesome customer service and also the breakfast that they had was very good as well and our bed was very comfortable and clean as well as the room. Everyone working there was very friendly .",1
"Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once.",1
"This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt. It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors. That was not the hotel's fault. That came from people with no social graces.",1

Great room and nice to have complimentary breakfast and coffee/tea most of the day. Facilities were clean and well maintained. It is located in a nice quiet area of Post Falls but is somewhat removed from most of the dining and activities. It's only a short drive away so only a minor inconvenience. Overall it was a great stay and we would not hesitate to stay again!,1
"The nicest attitude from the Manager to front desk and room assistance. The shuttle driver was pleasant and very helpful. Not only did he suggest places to eat, and take us to the place of our choice, it was the best Italian restaurant ever. He also made sure we saw the Memorial to the bombing victims both in daylight and after dark. Not to be missed!! Room was clean, fresh, completely stocked with amenities, and the bed was comfortable. I look forward to finding a reason to go back to Oklahoma City and the Knights Inn at Bricktown Hotel.",1

The bedding was clean and pleasant smelling. The airconditioning was life saving. Check in and check out were as easy as ABC. The cost for a solo guest was well worth the charge. The complimentary breakfast was eye opening. I would not hesitate to stay here again since Waynetown, Indiana does not have a motel.",1
"Element was one of the brands in the SPG chain that I had never stayed at before and I was pleasantly surprised. It had a Hyatt Place feel to it but more for an extended stay as my room had a full refrigerator, stove top, kitchen sink, microwave, dishes and silverware. The room was spacious and had a nice L...

"Room was too expensive. No full or continental breakfast. Staff a bit laid back. Breakfast was offered on site, but you paid for it. Excellent Restaurants nearby, Denny's and Willie Bird's for dinner. Cost much more for breakfast than normal. Location was OK. just off the freeway (101 North). Shower was very hard to turn on and I had to... More",1
"I had to travel to Tallahassee to take care of a personal business in a government office. I booked the hotel a few hours before I drove there.

"I was looking for a hotel near the Spokane Airport that provided a free early morning shuttle. I found Days Inn Suites Spokane Airport Airway Heights on Orbitz and it lived up to my expectations. It was a well maintained, economy hotel. Fair breakfast, good internet, clean room with a comfortable bed. I did have a problem with my... More",1
"we requested a non-smoking room and our assigned only room available reeked of cigarette smoke. The bathroom had mold around the tub, and the carpeted floor were dirty.",1
"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We will share your kind words with our staff, and we are so grateful for your support!We look forward to welcoming you back to New York soon! Kindly, Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge",1
"When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge.",0
Bad: Not much of a view. Good: Great location. Small hotel with good service. Lots of pillows:),1
"The room was nice and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. There were always refreshments in the lobby. The lemonade was good as were the cookies. The staff offered us bottled water after check in and they were all friendly.It makes our day to hear that we excelled your expectations of cleanliness during your stay! Thank you so much for your five star review, and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit.",1
Good: Location to the Inner Harbor and things to do is perfect. The daily breakfast was outstanding.,1
"Went to Cincinnati for a weekend as we often do during the summer. Our favorite hotels were booked or had very high rates, so we decided to try the Mellennium, which is very nearby. The hotel looks very nice from the outside. We upgraded to deluxe rooms in order to get a king sized bed. The rooms were adequate. My... More",1
No hot water for two days. Very uncomfortable. Had to take cold showers,1
The staff were outstanding! So professional courteous! I will definitely stay here again!,1
"We stayed here one night (9-14) prior to my spouse having a medical procedure done in Southaven, as it was a 1 1/2 hour drive from home and the stay made life much easier. The hotel parking lot was clean and well-lit, as we arrived after dark. When we entered the lobby, it smelled very clean and looked nice as... More",1
"I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal.",1
We will certainly stay here again! It was so nice and clean and comfortable. We felt safe and secure inside our room and outside. All of the employees we came into contact with were so friendly and helpful.And close to lot of things to eat and see right beside the motel...and so peace and no noisy at all...in night .I... More,1
"The room was larger and cleaner than most other hotels I have stayed at in the area. It is really hard to get a good nights sleep though when the rooms are so noisy. You could hear every door on the third floor open and close, the latches are incredibly loud. No letting the wife sleep and going out for... More",1
"Awesome, Overall",1
I stayed here for a weekend with friends. This is a great hotel that I rate as a solid 4 stars. The hotel is new and part of the city center development along with the Vdara and Mandarin Oriental hotels. It is attached to a mall with high-end shopping and very central. The rooms are very nice although I thought... More,1
"The hotel was fairly close to our destination. It was clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Frozen entrees for sale which was convient for travelers who didn't want to go out. No close restraunts close,without crossing the four lane highway. The beds left a lot to be desired, were lumpy and uncomfortable. We were on the first... More",1
"easy to find ,,,,, great stay",1
"Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again.",1
We had the most expensive room overlooking main street and It was a little noisy . We had a room on the side facing the ferry once before and even though the room was small it was quieter. Love that you can walk out the door and be able to walk to the restaurants and shopping ! A little pricier... More,1
"We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points.",1
"i stayed at room 239, to be honest it was very disappointing experience.. Breakfast is Ok.. but bed... noisy bathroom.. all were poor.",0
It has been a long time since I have had to give a security deposit. It hasn't been refunded yet either.,1
"For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor",0

"The resort is located on the sunny side of the island, with calmer waves. Centrally located to travel to many site-seeing spots on the island. Large and family friendly. One water slide, nice. Large ocean front to sit and relax and is away from the bustle of the pools so peaceful. Most rooms have a decent view of the ocean... More",1

Our son's lacrosse coach chose the Hampton Inn. Online check in and room selection was very easy and made check in at hotel a breeze. The room I had chosen online was waiting for us.

"We stayed here for a week just after Christmas with a family of 5. We booked two inter-connecting rooms, both had a king and a queen which was very comfortable for 5 people. We didn't book an ocean view room and overlooked the garden, in the Shipwreck Wing near the tennis courts - the outlook was fine. We booked this... More",1

"We arrived at the Bricktown Hotel but they had no record of our booking which was made through bookings.com. We decided to stay anyway and saved 20! Although the hotel is slightly out of town, they have a free shuttle to Downtown which we used in both directions. We found the staff to be helpful and charming. The room was... More",1
Pleasurable stay and friendly service. Much appreciated.,1
Hermann is a charming town and a good location for our bike ride on the Katy trail. The Betty and Chuck were very gracious and accommodating. Their home is lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The location is perfect for a visit to Hermann,1

"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team",1
"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.",1
Bad: There was a lot of noise out on the street around 3am. Not the fault of the Hotel. Good: The staff and atmosphere were amazing. The beds were super cozy! Security staff at the hotel were awesome,1
"it was the last night of a 12 day, 12 state motorcycle vacation. Really just looking for a clean place after a long, long day.

Our stay here couldn't be any better! We were able to check in a little early with a gentleman that was filling in from the Hampton inn next door. I don't remember his name but the check in process was quick and smooth and he was very nice and informative. The second night we chose to eat at the restaurant... More,1
"Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower.",1
"Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you",1
Bad: The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that bangs when cars drive over it all night. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome! The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation.,1
"Very clean and pleasant hotel. The noise level almost non existing, always a plus for me! The staff was very professional and catered to my needs without question. The banquet hall was very clean, a great size, well put together, and affordable. I will definitely be doing business with this location again. Thank you for providing me with a home... More",1
Good no frills room. Quiet cheap and convienent location. I'll return.,1

"The hotel was clean and comfy.

We had a great overnight trip to the National Harbor near DC. All of the sites and entertainment were within walking distance!,1

The food at the downstairs restaurant was delicious too and parking was really easy. Would thoroughly recommend.Thank you for this amazing review Melissa! We hope you will visit again soon.",1
"The staff at this hotel is awesome, always greeting everyone with a smile and looking to help if you need anything. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast bar was plentiful and even would make a waffle to order if you wanted. Didn't need to because the eggs were hot, the sausage just right, toast, yogurt, a banana...Breakfast done!...

"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",1
"The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean. The location is horrible as there isn't anything close in the way of stores or restaurants. If you arrive late you will have extremely limited access for dinning except for the over priced microwave food at the front desk. Breakfast and cocktail hour are a nice touch, but both need to be extended by an hour.",1
"Great place to stay with the kids! It has a nice pool, an indoor play area, and an arcade. The breakfast is what you would expect from other hotels not overly fancy. The hotel itself is a little run down but not particularly dirty. Most of the staff is very helpful. We booked two rooms and were upgraded to two huge three bed suites with two bathrooms so there was plenty of room for my family of five. We would stay again.",1
"I have become a very loyal customer of Best Western in the last 2 years. This stay before and after my cruise the hotel just proved that I have not wasted my loyalty. Everything was clean, staff was friendly, pool was wonderful, etc... This is why I stay Best Western. They haven't let me down yet.",1
went for a nature getaway. I am disabled and really loved the spacious room that I could get my mobility scooter around in. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even wash the blankets and covers for each new guest!!And I didn't hear any noise coming from other rooms.,1

"I'm very satisfied with my 6 nights stay with the hotel. Very close to the metro. The room is huge, clean and comfortable. The kitchen with a microwave, fridge, range, cooking utensils and plates, is a plus. The staff is friendly.I highly recommend this hotel.",1
Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower.,1
We had a great experience at this hotel. The staff was wonderful from beginning to end. The hotel was decorated beautifully. I had to take pictures and bring them home to show my mom and friends.

"My stay at Comfort Suites was very relaxing. They have every amenity that you could think of. They had an excellent hot breakfast every morning, a heated pool, and a fitness room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone because they are very understanding of your wants and needs. They will try their best to get you what you need.",1
"We only had 2 wash rags and there were 3 occupants. The faucet on the shower was loose, so we had to be careful. The room itself was clean and was very cozy, especially since I was traveling with 2 small children. We will definitely stay there again.",1
As soon as i arrived Yolanda took great care of me actually the best customer service iv ever had at any hotel. I will definitely be back just because of her! The place was nice and in a great area! I mean a pool free wifi great tv channels and free breakfast and bikes to ride! Doesn't get much better.,1
"Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open.",1
"I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day.",1
"The room was very clean, large room and had a nice decor. It was centrally located to various wineries, outlett, restaurants and downtown area.

We are glad you enjoyed your stay and will see you on your next visit.",1
Very disappointed in cleanliness of the room and daily cleaning. Greeted by indifferent desk clerks...not close to good restaurants. The renovation which has apparently been going on for a long time meant there was clutter in the entrance and hallways.,0
It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious. It also showed signs of lone term neglect. The included breakfast has to be the worst I have encountered - if all you want is a glass of orange juice they can handle... More,0
Great place to stay. Nearly new with good pool and great breakfast. All staff very friendly and worked hard to make stay a good one. No hot tub but pool very good! Rooms clean and comfortable. Good parking available. Well located in the town. Everything we needed and much more. Exceptional value!,1

"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
Bad: It's a little pricey. Good: Staff are approachable and definitely very helpful!,1
Excellent staff provides great service at a reasonable price. Rooms were clean quiet. Breakfast items were plentiful fresh. The requirement for a minimum of 200 characters for a review is annoying.,1
When I made this reservation I asked for a low floor because my daughter has a lot of sezuires and we needed to be able to get out quick if need be. The room was huge and very clean and the staff is very friendly. Will definatly be back. Thank you for acomidating us.,1
"I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More",0
"we had a very good check in and the staff helped in everyday, I took a card so we could call next summer to stay. we enjoyed our stay.",1
"The hotel was really nice! Although the room furniture was a little outdated, I had no complaints otherwise. A shuttle to the Metro was perfect! The staff was really friendly and accomodating. If you want a DC vacation without the expense or hassle of traffic, stay at this hotel!",1
"I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly.",1
"Wonderful suite hotel in Flagstaff. Convenient, although not in town. This I see as a positive. Everything was clean and efficiently run. Room was simple but very adequate for our needs which were just two nights and would be fine for long-term stays, as well. Really, we were delighted with this hotel.",1
We were traveling and we were looking for pet friendly hotels. We identified this one and when we arrived the lobby was empty....very little furnishings....however the lady at the desk was very friendly. We obtained our room and what a shock.....the person next door left the TV on loud for her pets. It was so loud that after thinking she... More,0
"everything was great - location, hotel lobby,  pool, The  only negative point was the awful coffee served at breakfast. Breakfast food in and off itself was fine. Loved being able to sit on the patio",1
"We wanted a hotel a little away from the beach to help cut costs. This was a great choice! The hotel was clean, comfortable beds, staff very friendly, and a great continental breakfast. They even had lemon water and cookies available in the afternoons. If we ever go back to this area, I will choose this hotel again!",1
"This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. I will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. We appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to Seattle.Sarah Junge",1
"It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke",0
We stayed at the Loews Portofino Bay because of the proximity to the Universal theme parks and added benefits of express passes and early park admission. We were there for 3 nights and then were booked at another hotel for the remaining nights of our holiday (which didn't end up happening due to Hurricane Matthew). The Good: - The water... More,1
Bad: Pictures vs. Apperhence. Good: Price,1
The hotel was beautiful and although it has only been there 8 months I was very pleased with my stay. I felt the hotel was understaffed the weekend I was there which caused check in to be delayed and my room was not ready when I arrived.,1
Manager Orlando was very accommodating on the phone and allowed us to have a great time in downtown Atlanta. The hotel is in a superb location and is easy walking distance to the most touristy sites in downtown ATL.,1
"I've been coming to conventions in Columbus for several years, this was my first time staying at The Crowne and it is by far superior in all ways. My experience started before check-in. I required special handicap accommodations, so I called the hotel directly to be sure that a couple of things could be prearranged for my room. I asked... More",1
We stayed here last year about this time to catch an early flight out of Pittsburgh. You can tell that the hotel is in the process of being renovated. Our room was done and looked great. The outside of the hotel was also being painted. The shuttle driver told us that the hotel was recently under new management and a lot of items that were left by the former management is now getting done.,1
My daughter and I were in Lafayette for a soccer tournament and this is where the team was set up to stay. We booked the room for a reasonable rate and I assumed there would be some due diligence as to the hotel and its conditions. After some research we found that the hotel was undergoing renovations. We requested to... More,0
"Personnel were friendly. Good if you need just a bed, shower, television and bathroom. Old but clean. No refrigerator or microwave. Very good for what I needed.I would stay there again. Low budget but clean.",1
This hotel superseded my expections. Rooms were gorgeous and hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating! Great location that I could walk to everything!,1
"Bad: On one day breakfast was downstairs and was too small and tight a space for number of guests. Good: Beds comfortable, mini bar reasonably priced fab location",1
"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge",1
"Stayed two nights over parents weekend in October. The bleak exterior and entrance was a little off-putting, so we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. The heat wasn't working, so it was pretty cold, but it was obvious they were doing their best to fix it so we toughed it out the first night. They supplied a space heater the next morning, but then moved us to another room (just as clean and comfortable) the second night. The hotel was full but we never heard our neighbors. Bathroom and breakfast were basic. Staff was friendly. Odd-numbered rooms face rear/away from street and parking lot. Recommended for quick stay.",1
"It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE.",1
Good: Great lobby/lounge area. Good casual work spaces. Free wifi a major plus!,1
What I Expected,1
"I would like to say thank you to all the staff, for our stay at the Omni. We were very much surprised when we got to the hotel. Loyalty Ambassador Tia A. Jackson contacted me in advance of our arrival and had ask if we had a special occasion, and I responded yes it was our 40th anniversary of our... More",1
Hotel was great Portland was not nothing is open on Mondays,1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us.",1
I stay here every chance I get. It is my hotel of choice in San Francisco. The service is always superb and the rooms are amazing. I have pretty high standard when it comes to hotel beds and the InterContinental more than lived up to them. I would recommend it to anyone.,1
"The facilties are nice , but the room need more cleaning .",1
Very nice funky industrial hotel. Greeted by cute little pup at the counter. Overhead shower was best experienced in a hotel. Honor bar not necessary for us - stayed with my UW-Madison student one night for orientation.,1
"Great location, beautiful decor. The lobby Sazerac bar is extremely popular and claims to be the birthPlace of its namesake drink. Note to older folks: The old bathroom tubs are extremely difficult to get into and out of to shower.",1
"Bad: No on site Spa Services, concierge was unable to give us any well thought out options. We secured our own Spa appointments.",1
Bad: Noisy.,1
Comfortable Clean If the Internet connection got 10 better It would have sucked!,1
"We had a wonderful time on our 25th anniversary. We highly recommend this hotel and their staff including the Front desk, Consear, bellhops, valet and all the people working the restaurants(5) etc. We especially enjoyed the saltwater pools.. this is definitely a five star atmosphere - very Ohana! Thanks to Expedia for allowing us to book this trip on line from the comfort of her own home. Mahalo",1
Bad: Coffee wasn't always available in lobby!. Good: Breakfast was great. Beds were very comfy! View was fantastic!,1
"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.",1
"A quick, overnight stay. This was our first experience with a Best Western and if they're all this good, we'll definitely look at Best Westerns in the future.",1
The room was very clean and bathroom was spacious and luxurious. We are very satisfied staying here.,1
Was not impressed! We only stayed here because it was close to Disneyland on our last night staying in California. We got in close to midnight. I had called to confirm earlier that evening letting them know that we were going to check in late-that was not a problem. Everyone was tired and just wanted to sleep. The A/C was always on. It did not turn off and we tried everything. Beds were uncomfortable-Difficult to sleep. Woke up to make coffee in our room. Coffee maker did not work.,0
Close to historic district and to Folly Beach. It was easy to plan the day after breakfast and return in the evening. Hotel was quiet and the staff was very accommodating.,1
"Bad: It's very expensive to park near the hotel, breakfast was not very impressive, some of smaller things like slippers were missing. Good: Everything was pretty good, helpful staff, great location.",1
The staff was great. The rooms were functional and comfortable. Not deluxe - but works. It's a bit of a trek to get to the mainland - don't be in a hurry at rush hour. But to stay at the hotel - great surroundings - and the access to the Gulf of Mexico is heavenly.,1
We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.,1
"The room was not clean, The light did not work over the vanity and the TV did not work. Had we known the TV did not work before morning we would've asked for another room.",0
Paid extra for the jacuzzi tub and it didn't even work. There was hair in the jacuzzi as well as the bath tub. Staff repeatedly called priar to stay saying my room wasn't going to be ready than saying nevermind when I called back. The room is run down and dirty and the extra amenity paid for didn't work. Breakfast... More,1
"You really don't need to leave this hotel between check-in and check-out, except of course we did. My initial reaction is that it's one of the quietest places we've ever stayed. Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Checking in and out were pleasant experiences. Staff are pleasant. Our room was beautifully furnished, bed very comfortable, bathroom nicely appointed and spacious.... More",1
"Pros: location and super friendly, accommodating staff Cons: noise...motel style in so the rooms face into a common courtyard and people sitting I the courtyard at night were loud.

"It was a pleasure to end up at the Hyatt Place Atlanta Airport South after staying at 2 different properties near the airport. Friendly staff, clean facilities, and room, comforatable bed. The (Sunday) morning breakfast buffet was crowded with many families, which made for long lines, and waits for food to be refilled. Also, seating as at a premium. But... More",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!",1
"When I first saw this motor inn, I thought there was now way I was staying at this place even though I had made reservations in advance. It needs a lot of repairs or maybe just rebuild the whole place. Everything looked very old and run down. The room itself was clean and comfortable and had all the necessary conveniences.... More",0
"The room was ok, no water in the room, stains in the carpet and the water cost 3.00 p/b in the lobby. No parking and the valet cost 35.00 per day.",1
"The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher.",1
"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",1
This is a very clean hotel centrally located to a variety of restaurants an amazing indoor water park nearby. Excellent free breakfast daily as well as coffee/tea available 24/7. Very kid friendly staff. Swimming Pool exercise room on site.,1
Very nice!,1
Friendly and helpful staff. GM was training and teaching staff when I arrived. Check in by Samantha was quick and painless. The room was new and comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Cheers!,1
"Side door onto Duval St. Perfect location. Rooms may be smaller than anticipated for US guests but standard for Europe. Poolside is great, excellent bar. Didn't eat so cannot comment on food. One big let down was housekeeping. Very poor for this level of property. GM knows who I am and they had plenty opportunity to fix it, but never came back. Overall still pleased. But fix room cleanliness and you then merit Marriott Autograph Collection...Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you ended up enjoying your stay but would have loved for you to have a perfect stay. We are taking action to prevent the issues you experienced from occurring again. We hope that you will return and give us the opportunity to provide you with a seamless stay here.Cheers!",1
"Wants to charge extra for everything. Micro wave, Refrigirator and glass of water. Have to wait 15 minutes to get hot water. Also another 15 minutes to bath tub water to drain. We book all most 25 rooms all the same story with bath tub.",0
"When all hotels in DC are over 250 during the week of the National Prayer Breakfast, it's so nice to have an affordable hotel near the Metro with complimentary breakfasts and DCA shuttles. Will definitely stay here again.",1
Nice place to stay! I would recommend to anyone needing overnight stay. The rooms are clean and spacious. The beds are amazing! The staff here is very friendly and helpful! Very reasonably priced and great locations.,1
The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.,0
When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.,0
"We needed a room last minute and this resort was reasonably priced. Was hesitant because it's so kid-centric, but they won me over. Staff was great and they put my husband and I in a room on the conference side - away from the water park. The view of the lake was fantastic. The grounds are well kept. Walking distance... More",1
"We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having.",1
I thought it could b a lot cleaner! Love the hotel but grounds and our patio could been a lot cleaner!,1
"Location is perfect, right across from Santa Monica pier and we walked to Venice Beach in the morning (2 miles each way). Also walking distance from 3rd avenue shops so really perfect location. Hotel itself is very modern, sleek, hipster. For example, the shower is completely clear although there is a privacy option. Room size is average/small. I prefer more... More",1
Our upgraded balcony room over looked the dumpster. The housekeeping service was VERY POOR. The hotel billed for Wi Fi service that was not used. Towels were never replaced and we had to call for soap.,0
We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....,1
Had 3 rooms for our group. One door wouldn't hardly lock. Had strong animal smell. We stayed 5 nights and they did not clean our room once. Definately would not recommend this hotel. Worse hotel I have ever stayed in.,0
"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",0
Bad: Very satisfied.,1
"Went down for a Giants game and wanted a place to stay within walking distance of ATT Park. I have back problems so I was looking for a short and safe walk. The last time we went down for a game we stayed the Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero . Just as a side note, we had a fine stay... More",1

The horse and carriage was the perfect departure for us and our guests also loved seeing us off in this. Although I would give Michael a 5 out of...

Thank you Michael, we could not have had a better driver!",1
"We stayed two nights here while in town to visit with our son that lives in the area. The hotel was excellent. Room was spacious, beds were comfortable and everything works correctly. Would definitely recommend.Hello Guest, Thank you so much for your kind review! We appreciate the recognition and are so happy you enjoyed your stay with us. It was a pleasure and we hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Liz Lionberger General Manager",1
"We stayed at Konea tower facing the beach. The amenities provided by this resort was great from full kitchen, Bosch dishwasher, washer and dryer furnished with detergent everyday. Great for couples and especially families. The concierge service was excellent as well, helped us planned our first trip to Maui. We will return.",1
"Forget staying there. Unless you want a trashed out hotel room, with clueless employees. Room that we booked was not available (King) so we ended up having to take a double room. First room we were given had nothing but cement floor in it. Clerk didn't know that entire floor was under construction. 2nd room, door wouldn't work, were told... More",0
"Pros: Amazing location right in front of the beach, and a short driving distance away from South Beach. Beautiful lobby, free wifi, great breakfast, staff was really nice but could've been more proactive. Make sure to book an oceanfront room and ask for a high floor - it's TOTALLY worth it. Cons: Check-in was awful. I booked a room with... More",1
Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need.,0
The hotel is a good pick when the goal is to have a place to crash that is cheaper than the majority in the area and when you want something clean. I did appreciate the shuttle to and from the metro that was provided for free. The hotel doesn't have a lot of extras but it fit the bill for us.,1
"Filthy hotel! Bed bugs or fleas, not sure which but we scratched all night. Dirty rags, dirty tub, nasty carpet and sheets. Should have been tipped off when I had to wade through trash overflowing the trash can in the breakfast area. Mgr. wouldn't return phone calls (3) and when I finally reached him, he said he'd give me 10.... More",0
The first room we got instantly smelled like smoke so we told the front desk and they got us a new room - which was very nice of them. Our second room smelled like an old frat house. I slept in a hooded sweatshirt because I didn't feel comfortable in the bed. We didn't use any blankets because they smelled... More,0
Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.,1
"This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!",1
"My husband and i went to Hawaii to celebrate our honeymoon. When we searched for hotels we found the coconut waikiki hotel which seemed to look good on pictures.

Awesome resort! We are always pleased with the staff and the rooms. One of the best resort beaches in Lahaina. Great beach entry for kids and the pool has plenty to keep the kids happy. We have stayed at this resort 4 times and will continue in the future.,1
Very clean nice hotel. Within a 15 minute walk to the inner harbor attractions. Room was very clean. Indoor pool nice but small. Complimentary breakfast was good. Nice hotel close enough to inner harbor great price.,1
"Two families shared a two bedroom two bathroom condo and didn't feel crowded at all. Plenty of space in the living and dining area, with extra space on the balcony too. The kids loved the swimming pool with slide, and we had a nice lunch by the pool, and dinner at the Dukes. Lovely holiday resort! Only slight downside was... More",1
"Staff replaced key card when we lost the original set. A little tricky to find the hotel, but very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast buffet was very good. Only con was that the furniture was a little scuffed.",1
"Great place. Bed was firm, room was clean and convenient for what we needed it. A bit small but... Can't believe what they offer is considered breakfast. Can you say sugar and carbs. mini muffins, sugary cereals, and juices. Not one thing good for you! Terrible! I guess that is what an American breakfast consists of now Scary!",1
"This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again.",1
"We were in Kansas City to see ""Once"" at the Kaufmann Performing Arts Center and decided on this hotel for a good location, near the venue. We were beyond pleased with our stay in the Sheraton. The hotel is classy and the area is vibrant. So much to take in and appreciate. Our stay was a ""5"" across the board.",1
"We arrived around noon and check-in was not until 4 pm and they gave us room immediately. The room was very large and clean with a balcony. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property. Hope to see you on your 2nd trip to Napa.",1
Room smelled of stale smoke. Furniture broken and dirty.,0
"Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities. Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return.",1
"First, this is a discount hotel so don't expect the Westin! The rooms are newly remodeled and clean. Request a room on the other side of the building from the highway and you will sleep fine. The neighborhood is fine and there are nice restaurants close by. I thought it was weird that I had to sign a paper stating... More",1
"We stay here all the time when visiting family in the area. This is my favorite Hampton Inn. Great rooms, super staff, great breakfast, good location close to shops, mountains and beach. The Front Desk always works with us to get us a room that meets our needs. Recently renovated and always clean.",1
"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. It has a special inner court to walk your pup. A very nice discount when someone in your family is in the local hospital. Centrally located for access to St. Luke Hospital, downtown Boise. It is quiet, the staff is helpful and understanding to your coming and going at odd times day and night and... More",1
"Check in - very helpful. Room - probably as we thought from the reviews (we took a chance seeing the comments about refurbishment). Beds - comfortable in main room, pretty shocking bed settee for the kids to sleep on in the sitting area. Pool - looked dirty although we did not use, plenty of others did. Gym - very poor and should be removed as a feature (planet fitness ideal if you do need a day pass for a workout!) Location - absolutely fine for Busch Gardens. Noise - no real problems at all. Price - absolutely fine. Wifi - just about OK. Breakfast - OK. We were not disappointed as such, the hotel was OK, they know they need to refurbish, but probably need to do this sooner rather than later to avoid too many negative reviews. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was because it had separate rooms for us and the kids and it fitted the bill for this reason.",1
"still very good. I would say though that this is not the second ranking hotel in Chesapeake as it was listed the last tie I looked at the ratings. The corridors could use new carpeting. The beds are comfortable. The breakfast the first morning we were there was lacking a few items. The Fairfield Inn is better but, if you... More",1
"I was satisfied with my stay at this property on August 13, 2015.",1
"Hotel staff were very nice! Room appearance was nice, but I could tell that someone had smoked in the room. Other than that it's not a bad place to stay for a night.",1
"this is not a 3 star hotel - on top of cleanliness issues, we had a two issues with wake up calls. One 2 hours early and the other which didn't come at all.",0
"Rooms were outdated a little but that's okay. A wall sconce didn't work, no matter which switch we turned on. Fridge wasn't cold upon arrival. Nice, big TV where the entire room could see - we had a suite. Creaky bathroom door...and with a baby sleeping that's not convenient. Overall okay. Good front desk customer service at check in. Would... More",1
The room was absolutely horrible. It stunk an was hidious slept on couch because bed look like sheets never been washed. Do not stay here for your own health.,0
"Stayed here for 10 nights Rooms very Clean, Kitchenette very very well provided paper Towel everything you need Except a kettle (hey I am British). The only one very little gripe more chairs outside would be good. Laundry room clean and washers and driers very good",1
"Brilliant place. Just wish we had spent more time as we only stayed one night, as we used as a base to see the Grand Canyon. We all really enjoyed the complementary full breakfast. Lovely double rooms with plenty of space",1
In town overnight to attend a funeral. Nice hotel. Staff was very friendly.,1
This is a newly renovated motel. We had a clean room with courteous staff and a nice breakfast. They even mailed me the pills I had left in the room! A good place to stay when passing through the area.,1
"To noisey, other guest were to loud kids running up and down hallways. After coming back to room from being out all day room smelt like weed, coming from room next door. Room above the bathroom when guest would take showers you can hear the water dropping on our ceiling causing a large water stain on ceiling. To expensive for that stay with all problems.",1
"At 150 a night for 1 room with 2 queen beds I have stayed at nicer hotels for less money. Over all the room was comfortable with nice air conditioning controlled by a wall thermostat. There is a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee pot in the room, The hotel has a nice small pool indoors but could use a good cleaning... More",1
"Staff accommodated our room request upon arrival. Rooms were extremely clean organized. Kitchenette is a nice touch. Nice pool for the kids, no spa. Breakfast food selection was average, limited space. Great place to stay at a great value!",1
Bad: N/A. Good: The coffee was good and the room was real nice.,1
"Couples quick getaway from the valley. Perfect little boutique hotel right in the middle of downtown, on whiskey row. Walk to everything. It was clear that the owners gave attention to every detail of the hotel and each room in this tasteful remodel. The rooms were very modern yet kept that period feel and history of the hotel. Very clean,... More",1
What a wonderful find. A lovely hotel with superb staff who provide excellent service and make you feel very welcome. Fantastic rooms for the price and spotless. Peter at front of house is a wonderful representative who could do equally as well in a top London Hotel. He was impeccable. Location was only a short walk from seafront and there... More,1
"I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex. I've read the numerous other reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The rooms are nice, because they are new, but everything else... More",0
Bad: The smell sometimes from sewer only when in hallway. Good: The hotel was great and staff was very friendly. We will definitely stay there again,1
"We stayed in a Queen with a private bath. Even this room was way too small. When I opened the door, I could barely get my luggage in without hitting the bed. We picked the romance package which came with a bottle of Edgefield sparkling wine, handmade local chocolates and massage oil. Very nice! We didn't eat here because we both feel McMens has grown tired - and there are so many great new restaurants in McMinn. If you like a tiny room with a creepy atmosphere, this place is for you!",0
Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice.,1
"We stayed at the North Star Lodge over the Martin Luther King weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the condition of the property. Our room was recently renovated. It was spacious, nicely decorated and had comfortable beds. A new LCD TV and DVD player were in the room. Although the wall are paper thin, earplugs made sure I slept soundly.... More",1
"Ever since Danny took over La Quinta Corsicana, it has become an awesome hotel. It is clean, beautiful and everyone is friendly and efficient. The pool is heated!! The spa is wonderful! AND it is pet friendly!! It is an excellent choice and we are so grateful for them!",1
The hosts were friendly and welcoming. They were available to answer any of my concerns or needs.,1
This is good and clean budget motel. The room was clean and the staff was very friendly. There are places walking distance to eat. We just stayed one night but if in Medford Or. again we will stay again.,1
"This was a convenient stop on our road trip along route 90, but the quality was not as good as other Red Roofs. We had to request soap for the shower, and the sheets were worn out. There was a hole in the top sheet.Thank you for sharing your guest experience. We are sorry your guest experience was not everything you expected or deserve. We truly hope you give us another shot in the future.",1
"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again.",1
"O hotel e meio longe do centro de Washington, mas valeu pelo conforto e pelo preco. O hotel oferece um transporte para ida e volta para o metro para compensar a distancia: Gostei",1
Good: Great property! Excellent team of young dedicated profeccionals,1
"We stayed with Keith, Denise Zoro the final weekend of Ballon Fiesta, 10/15. To say their BB is perfect in every way that they are delightful, helpful hosts doesn't do it justice! The rooms are beautiful, nicely furnished, comfortable! beds, clean! The whole home is beautifully decorated furnished. The breakfasts are outstanding from the food to... More",1
"This hotel could use upgrading. It is clean enough, but truly bare bones. Of greater concern was the mandatory destination fee of 9.95 per day that tacked on the bill. There was no option to decline it, and I was not informed ahead of time. In essence, it adds 10 to the room charge. I booked this hotel because the price seemed reasonable. But at 10 more per day, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel for the same price.",1
"I cannot say enough good things about the comfort level and cleanliness of this hotel. Great breakfast items, vast majority of goodies. They even have fresh berries for your cereal toppings. Great coffee too. Very comfortable bed and lots of plush pillows. Clean workout room with good machines.",1
"The chalet inn is priced very reasonably, The room is spacious with a lounge area. The lobby is rather quaint in terms of interior decor. I arrived late at night at 1130pm a signboard told me to check in at econolodge. luckily, I saw the signboard before my taxi left. I redirected the taxidriver to econolodge at the bottom... More",1
We were in the best western premier on Feb. 11 with our two Yorkshire terrorists. The staff were so very nice.

We will definitely return to this find hotel.,1

Bar wasn't open very long. Great location. Loved the spread at the bar at happy hour as well as drink tokens.,1
"Since the renovation at Old Colonial Motel this is the Best Motel on the Beach. We bring our Yellow Lab every year to this pet friendly motel. The king size bed was so comfy I slept like a baby.

"all new amenities and great free breakfast, quiet location, very clean, very nice and friendly staff, definitely will stay there again!",1
"We were pleased with our stay at this hotel. The room was comfortable and clean. It met our needs. The only change we'd suggest, is a complementary free breakfast, instead of the Bistro Breakfast provided.",1
"Nice restaurant on premises, wonderful if you arrive late and tired and don't want to go out to find something to eat. Varied menu, surprisingly good food and table wine by the glass. Breakfast, which came with the room, was also good. Omelet station, waffles, and an assortment of other breakfast items including fruit, yogurt, cereals, breads, and sausage or... More",1
"We chose the place partly part of the bad reviews, we suspected that peoples' complaints might be a little silly and we were right. The room is comfortable, clean, fresh and new. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is nothing to write home about, but it's not important as there's a Denny's right next door.",1
The hotel staff was friendly and at service. Room was nice and clean. breakfast was pretty good. The ameneties and toiletries option was good if you forget anything. If you stay at hotel than this is good hotel for the price,1
We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker,1
The staff was super friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate. I would definitely stay here again.,1
"Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel.",1
"This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat.",1
Bad: Bed was not comfortable - they need to replace the mattress. Good: Room was clean.,1

Might have stayed in a BW a handful of times over the years. It was just never a chain that I ever felt any loyalty to. We were heading to Galveston for a cruise and stopped in Lufkin the night before on the way down. I have to say was a nicer room than I have received at much higher... More,1
"Bad: Room smelled, mattress was thin and hard. Clerk changed my rate to higher price when we arrived saying we got wrong rate. Charged more than was quoted on booking. Gave us a map and I guess they get a lot of complaints because it says FYI hotel built on 1989. Bring your own toiletries. Very little lighting in room and no electric plugs. Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking.",0
I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet,1
"I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!",1
Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.,0
The hotel was nice but unfortunately something was wrong with our air. We turned it in at checkin around 6 and was hoping by bedtime it would be better. We just decided to suck it up so we could try to get some rest in hopes of waking up cooler,1
"My husband and I planned a last minute trip and chose this motel based on reviews. It was a favorite! The room, including bathroom was very clean. Bed was comfortable with crisp sheets that were so appreciated after a long day of activities. Pool along with hot tub and sauna was clean, and all worked perfectly. It was conveniently located....

Rooms were very clean, beds were comfortable with crisp clean bedding, Staff were very pleasant, friendly welcoming yet professional (Made us feel welcomed). Housekeeping... More",1
It's about 15 mins from beach. You are not near it. No microwave. No refrigerator. But good for the money. Breakfast is very busy. Pool was closed only one day of our stay.,1
The rooms were fairly loud and the bed were just okay. There also was not a lot of restaurants around that were open past 10 so if you like to eat late like us it might be an issue. Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks.,1
Very nice and close to enerywhere I had to go,1
The staff is extremely friendly and always great weary travelers with a smile. The check in process is seamless. Ken and Annie in Guest Services are personable and attentive to a traveler's needs. One of my favorite places to stay,1
Bad: I dont like the anchovies in the Caesar dressing. Good: Bed and pillows are the best,1
"Attentive and friendly staff. Quick and immediate response to requests and housekeeping needs. We stayed at the Star Inn , comfortable, clean and a convenient location.",1
"The staff was very helpful throughout my stay at this hotel. The hotel room was very clean. The breakfast that they serve every morning is great, and is a great deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Anaheim.",1

You can get it our of the sink like everyone else. was her reply to my request Although I couldn't find water suitable for drinking, there was no lack... More",0
Bad: Poor sound isolation in rooms. Good: Close to most attractions,1
They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out.,0
Bad: I didn't like the fact that we only stayed for one night. Good: Fabulous boutique hotel. Great location. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Will return.,1
"Our stay at this Wingate was exceptional! We were greeted with a warm, friendly staff. As a bonus, we received a goody bag of munchies and a water, upon check-in, which was a pleasant surprise.",1
The Mills is located with in walking distance of all of the historic district . My wife and I really enjoyed being able to walk to our dinner dates and see the sites all around us. Thanks do much!,1
Good for a one night stay for a low price,1
Room cleanliness Excellent customer service Location convenient from Airport,1
"I was met by the most welcoming and friendly attendant I have ever encountered at the front desk for an easy check in.

"Quiet neighbourhood, good value for money. They had a pool and waterslide, but we didn't use it.",1
"When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything.",0
"Great stay. I would recommend staying here for business, family or couple weekend. Close to downtown Napa and Sonoma. The employees here are exceptional! So many options for breakfast. They also offer wine tasting if youre around at 5!",1
"We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. It is candid reviews like yours, that allow us to continually look at ways to make guest's stay more comfortable and relaxing. I have mentioned your comments to the appropriate department managers, and we are brainstorming ways to review your areas of concern. We are delighted to serve you again, if your travel needs bring you back to the Orange County area. Thanks again!Warmest Regards",1
"Great food had breakfast at the Loading Dock And Dinner at the Hickory Pit. We even won 20000 credits playing Keno on the Machines and also won big playing live Keno. When got home, we even put money back in your bank.",1
"The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked.",1
"No Hassles, No problems. Perfect Quality Hotel. Room was in great condition. Every Staff member was amazing and caring. From the breakfast staff to the front desk concierge. It is in a perfect location too. And Breakfast was of good quality.",1
"Worst place I've ever stayed. Toilet leaked, shower faucet was broken. So noisy, was like sleeping on the highway. Beds old and not comfortable. Weird people lurking around. I just can't even explain how terrible it was except to say I recommend t they just bulldoze the whole thing.",0
"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience.",1
"I have gone every year since I was 3 years old and it is my favorite place on earth!!!! I love going to the beach, kayaking and playing cards with my friends and family :) The views are breathtaking and I love every moment I spend there!",1
"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
Bad: No pool :(. Good: The perfect Location,1
Bad: Fit and finish construction of rooms could have been better. Good: n/a,1
"Too much construction all around Jan. 2016--the street, two hotel buildings behind and adjacent made it very noisy!! Check this before booking...Rooms large, good cleaning service, helpful staff at front desk. Street parking is difficult to find...beware of towing.",1
"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok.",1
"The hotel is well worth the extra money! Excellent staff, the facilities are very nice, and it's well located. 35 minutes from the beach in one direction 35 minutes from Williamsburg/Busch Gardens in the other direction. The staff was spot on. When we checked in, we needed linens for the pull-out bed. By the time I was able to unload my car, they were there waiting on the bed!",1
Great location and facility. I did the mobile check in which was fast and easy. And I also did the TV check out. Which was just as easy. I loved the high tech rooms. And the bed was comfy. I also enjoyed the casino. and the slot machines. Will stay again.,1
Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable,1
The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad,0
"Don't let the hotel pics fool you. The rooms are VERY small outdated. Save your money go across the street or even down the street for a better, not to mention safer stay. Pay the extra 10 or 20 go to Holiday Inn Express. Trust me.",1
Bad: bathtub too slippery. Good: the breakfast and fruit water,1
"I was so disappointed in this property! Threadbare, torn carpet, no guest services until 6am, dingy outside. I didn't feel comfortable the entire time I was there. Does not look anything like the photos posted. Until they do a major renovation, find another place to stay.",0
Bad: The room lacked a traditional desk and desk chair. This made it uncomfortable to use a computer. Good: Breakfast served on each floor,1
"This all hotel is very nice for this area of Hmpton Inns and Courtyards, but they dont deserve the class boutique they give themselves. The rooms are spacious and clean, with top drawer amenities, but there is no warmth or special service from the establishmeny, even though we had 100 guests fot a wedding. The shuttle service was great. The... More",1
"Great value and view with this vintage style motel. Rooms are very large with updated bathroom area, fridge, and microwave. Free wifi and ice. We had two double beds in the room. The mattress on one was very old and sagging on one side. The other bed was fine. Would stay again but ask for a room with newer mattresses.",1
"My wife and I stayed her for 4 days and loved every minute of it. The staff was welcoming, and the rooms we clean, comfortable, and have 2 flat screen TVs. The rooms have 2 balcony with thick glass to prevent street noise and we slept so well. It is located in the heart of town, right on the water... More",1
"This was the only hotel with a 2 bedroom unit available for our stay with a mother in law. I dont know about the regular rooms but this one is a separate building with 4 suites, each one of them with a living / kitchen / half bath downstairs and 2 rooms and a full bath upstairs. Few details: kitchen was not stocked: no glasses, dishes, forks, knives, pans...so you cant cook. We were not planning to cook but a heads up. There was unfinished drywall work on ceiling, very old inefficient windows and uninsulated roof. Good heat source but very noisy, cant keep it on at night it will wake you up. The room has not been upgraded since the 80s: green carpet, wall paper...just that old beachy CA feel. Service was excellent, so was their restaurant, but we felt that for the price and location this suite needs to be revamped. Worked for 1 night though.",1
"not luxury, but not dirty and a place to rest head. Can't complain, great price for a room.",1
"Had a great stay! The hotel staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, especially Sami and Matt. Thank you so much!",1
Wonderful. Spacious room. Friendly staff,1
"As previously mentioned in other reviews, check-in is across the street on the 2nd floor, so I was prepared for that. Got a basic 2 bedroom oceanfront on the 4th floor. Room was nice. Full size fridge, stove, microwave, all the basics. Kitchen had plates, silverware, cups, other utensils and appliances, everything you needed. Basic bathroom with a hair dryer.... More",1
I note there have been some renovations to this hotel however no matter how much you renovate you still need to employ enough staff to keep a hotel clean and well maintained. This does not seem to be happening at this hotel. First we stayed for three days and never once did we see a manager or housekeeping or building... More,0
It was great but I usually book places where's there is a complimentary breakfast. I would not stay there again.,1
The staff were extremely helpful. They offered directions and even a weather report for us during our stay. The room was very comfortable and well stocked with towels. Breakfast was simple but very satisfying. It is only open for about 2 hours. It has been updated and I really liked the improvements. You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95.,1
"Let me start by saying I wanted some place safe and clean with WIFI. My adult son and I were exhausted after visiting schools and driving all day. We had many choices and I choose the cheapest place. I have no regrets. As others have mentioned, the showers were not the hottest, the lobby was dingy but so what. The... More",1
"Although there's no special amenities, it is clean and more than affordable. Typically we are out shopping when visiting the area so we spend little time in the room. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head and use the money you save for shopping, this is your place!! :)",1
"My husband and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was packed but that didn't seem to affect the staff. They were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful-full of choices and whenever they got low on something a staff member came and changed it out. I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!",1
"Although the view was very nice, the efficiency room facing the cove left a lot to be desired. There were only 3 forks and one butter knife in the drawer, nothing sharp enough for a grilled steak so that plan was scrapped. The room was miniscule and not very clean. There was mold on the inside of the fridge along... More",0
Bad: The elevators were a problem.,1
"We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont! This is an excellent hotel, with great attention to detail including hotel grounds, architecture, amenities and staff. Service is first class and natural, you are made to feel very welcome. Great looking golf course, and plenty of other activities to enjoy such as walking, the pool, tennis. Or just relax in the...

"We wanted to stay in San Luis Obispo on our way home. We found this inn very nice, well kept. Can't complain about the location, near to a lot of restaurants. Not too much road noise. It has a microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker.",1
We had a very pleasant 3 day stay. Would stay here next time my family and I are in town.,1
Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood.,0
Clean. Friendly staff. Very large rooms. Highly recommend.,1
Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in.,1
We were planning a visit to the Corning museum of glass so figured we would pay more for a better bed and get plenty of sleep for our day long adventure. Was so dissapointed as the beds at this Hampton are not premium beds at all. This was by far the worst night sleep we had on our recent 10... More,0
"Jenell and Micheal and the overnight guy we re extremely welcoming and informative. The rooms were big and clean and we slept well, even though we got in late. Breakfast was rather standard hotel breakfast but they had the coffee, oatmeal and waffles needed to get us on the road without being hungry.",1
"We were traveling through here on a pretty tight budget. I searched for cheap hotels and found this. It looked good enough for what we were looking for, so I booked it. When we arrived, we noticed the outside was manicured beautifully. We checked in easily. The room was very nice. Had a bit of a musty smell when we... More",1
"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions.",1
"Good: Everything was nice, price, location and breakfast",1
"The rooms are very nice. Large flatscreen TV, kitchen...more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Only bad thing was that it's not super close to restaurants or bars. Other than that though, it's a great deal for the price, and very close to the metro.",1
"This is a great hotel, good price, very clean, very nice stay. The rooms are nice, the beds were soft. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool. It was an overall great place to stay we'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay that doesn't cost too much.",1
"OK, when entering the room, the TV was on and the remote would not work, went to desk and clerk said o, maybe it was a ghost and gave me new batteries for the remote-but was someone in the room-OH NO! Got the 30 percent discount but the room was not as nice as I've been accustomed. That evening a... More",1
"Bad: Not a thing. Good: The room was nice and clean, bed was very comfy. The restaurants were all great the Buffet was awesome.......... So much to do in the aera",1
"Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens",0
Customer service was exceptional,1
Enjoyed our stay there. The staff was very friendly. Love taking our 2 dogs with us when we travel,1
We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it.,1
firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended,1
"The room was very nice, the A/C was phenominal in the room, a quiet and pleasant stay. The staff was very nice. The only downside of the stay was the internet cut in and out through the day. Overall, great experience!",1
Worth staying here - great breakfast.,1
This hotel is nice with really beautiful grounds and views from our room. They have a fantastic nature trail. Our room was nice and large. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's also close to the airport. We also liked the free parking option. We enjoyed The restaurants and large bar on the property also. Good food and drinks!... More,1
The hotel staff went above and beyond.,1
"Good: The location was easily accessible to any downtown activities and the strip, we went to the pinball neon museum and the fremont street experience in one day. It was great",1
We always enjoy our stays at Hampton Inns and have never spent the night in a bad one. This HI was up to the usual high standard and is a place we feel good to stay. The complimentary breakfast is more than adequate for our needs although a non cheese hot choice would be most welcome. The staff were helpful... More,1
"A very good, quiet, comfortable, safe, clean, perfectly fine on-campus hotel. Light breakfast included. Room has a microwave and min-ref. You can't beat the location for a Harding University visit. Free WiFi, cable TV. Walk indoors to food court, offices, meeting rooms. Parking is right out the entry door. Very friendly and helpful front desk staff.",1
"Older style motel split up into 2 or 3 single story buildings, all with exterior, park at your door entry. This arrangement looked odd to me at first but, actually made the whole property feel uncrowded and relaxed. Surrounding grassy areas were nice and the property overall seems to be in great condition. The room was just fine - perfectly... More",1
"If you've got kids then this is a step-up from the standard pool to swim in. There are 2 slides, water cannons and other play structures for kiddos old and young. There is also a hot tub for moms and dads. It is a lovely pool area with huge, wall-sized windows looking outside (we swam and played at sunset, it... More",1
"Over all stay was great. Rooms were clean. Within walking distance of club house, did not eat at club house, but others in our party did and said food was good. Roads are in need of repair, so if you're on a motorcycle watch out for pot holes. Staff was friendly and helpful with the exception of one housekeeper who... More",1
Wifi was way too slow to be able to do much.,1
Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol,1
Bad: The complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Kinda a joke. Very disappointing. For the money we spent for the room we expected a bit more. Good: Staff was nice and helpful. Room was clean and somewhat nice.,1
"My only one complaint is that you have not mentioned your phone number in the web site( when I took the print out after booking, there is no phone number on the sheet). I was not aware that your shuttle service will not pick from Crystal city metro station, so I waited for your vehicle for about 20mins, and then I got help from Rennainace hotel's shuttle.Thank you",1
"The shower had issues maintaining one temperature which was very disheartening. The first room I checked in to reeked of cigarettes, but they gladly moved me once I complained. Overall a little underwhelmed with the hotel this time around...",0
"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Location, room size, cleanliness.",1
"Our room was clean, the staff was very pleasant. Not a fancy place but bed was comfortable and the breakfast was ample - fruit, cereal, toast and bagels, juice, waffles. We didn't realize there was a pool - nice to go in and warm up.",1
We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon.,1
"Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel.",1
"Hotel was not prepared for a busy Sunday night, as expressed by front desk staff. Many of us stood around waiting to get our rooms. Not sure how many got the rooms chosen in their on-line check-in. We did not. Took awhile for clerk to acknowledge it Wasn't the room we had chosen. Even though he argued that it was,... More",1
"Awesome hotel in an awesome location in an awesome city. The staff went above and beyond. The style of the hotel was great. We had an awesome view of city hall. Perfect central location to do anything in Phily.Perryjo9,Thank you so much! Awesome is certainly the word I would also choose to describe our team, they are the best in the city, and we are truly fortunate to have them all. I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself so much, and I hope that we have the chance to see you again soon!Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager",1
Bathroom needed maintenance to the sink and tub was pealing. Nice furniture and room was nice. Front desk attendant was paying more attention to her phone than the customers. No bottled water available at the concessions. Ice machine broken on 2nd floor. Overall I like this Hotel was just a little disappointed in the services offered.,1
"We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!",1
"Very busy, efficient-enough airport location. Rooms quite OK.. housekeeping fine.. but hotel is getting run down. Some modern era touches lacking, i.e., not enough power outlets near desk or bed. Staff tries hard to accommodate guests. Irksome and preposterous 50/night 'incidentals' charge which is returned post-stay.",1
"My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars.",0
"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning",0
"The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much.",0
"We had booked at this hotel 4 months in advance because TripAdvisor said this was the 1 hotel in Winnfield and honestly we did not even stay for 1 hour, we went to our room called La Jagu and moved to that hotel, please see my review of that hotel for information about it. When we arrived, the ladies at... More",0

Bad: The appetizers 5-7pm were the same for 4 nights in a row. Please provide some variation. Good: Breakfast buffet on the 20th floor was wonderful,1
"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe.",0
"We wanted to get away for a couple of days and hit the local casinos that are within a 20 minute drive from this location. The hotel is in a fairly sketchy area just south of I-10 near Vinton. There is a small video poker casino on the premises, but it was not our cup of tea. The room was... More",1
"We had another excellent vacation at Honua Kai. I looked around at the competitors - Westin / Sheraton / Marriott, but renting a Honua Kai condo through VRBO is still a considerable savings.

This is located on the highway close to the air museum and makes it easy to drive to Dayton/Dundee area in one direction and less than 5 minutes from downtown McMinnville. The staff was very nice and our room was comfortable. They provide a free breakfast and have a pool.,1
"Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue.",1

The room was clean. The breakfast for good. The pool was nice. Perfect location to downtown savannah and tybee island. Staff was friendly. The only thing I can say negative is that the a/c didn't cool really good but we did stay cool when the sun went down at night. But during the day it was a little warm. Hard to get the room cool.,1
Perfect location to visit FAMU. Local eating places were in walking distance. The mall was literally about 3 minutes away. The feel of being in an almost new facility was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to those traveling to Tallahassee.,1
Only good thing is close location to downtown. Manager wrote me back defending that the mattresses will be replaced over the next couple of years but no mention of why they use blood stained bed covers. Otherwise I certainly won't be coming back ...,0

Bad: Wish there was ironing and ironing board in room. As well as microwave. They did provide iron and ironing board that I shared with my girlfriend 2 doors down and they let me use their microwave by the bar. So worked out. Good: Loved Javier and rest of the staff. Anything I needed they accommodated.,1

"These rooms are great if you're in town for a limited purpose, ie (business trip, seeing friends or family, etc). However, I don't recommend if you're looking for something fancy or romantic. It's a very old building and a little run-down. I wasn't wild about the location either. It's tucked away and kind of hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. If you can get a deal through one of those sites out there, do it but it's definitely not worth what they tell you over the phone.",1
"This room should have been advertised for 19. I can't believe I spent 80 on this place! For starters, the sheets looked unclean, and when we pulled the blankets back the pillows beneath were -covered- in an assortment of straight and curly black hairs. I'm sure they haven't been laundered for centuries. There were moth wings melted into the insides... More",0
"From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty! Every.Single.Time we came back from whatever we were doing,we were greater with hello and how are you!!! Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!",1
"We had stayed at this Days Inn several years ago, and it has gone down hill since then. The breakfast was minimal, and the equipment in the fitness room did not work.

"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel.",1

The hotel is safe and basic. The good points are the hot tub. The rooms are old and need remodeled. They have the basic dark walls and dark bedspread and really old bathroom.

But hotel is good .",1
"Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!",1
I thought the hotel was clean and comfortable. The woman at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We loved the shower,1

"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar.",1

"We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality",1

Had a good stay until a disturbance broke out across from my room at 2 in the morning. No one cared enough to address the issue the couple across the hall were having even after it was reported several times. The altercation ended after they kicked my door several times and I informed them of what would be in store if this behavior continued. I spoke to the front desk and they cared enough to offer me a free cup of coffee. Embassy Suites.........,1

"The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables.",1

"second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool).",1
"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful.

The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.,0

"All in all, an OK experience. They have a little continental breakfast every morning, so that is nice. There is a Denny's across the street, so I did that a few mornings because I am a fan of a big breakfast variety. There is a gas station right next to the hotel that has a good selection of drinks and snacks, so that was a bonus because I didn't have to walk or drive far to get these items.

Our first impression on entering the premises was that it was very run down. To me there was an odor. It needed new floors and paint. When... More,0
Overall I was satisfied with our stay. The only issue I had was the kitchen floor did not appear clean. I spoke to the front desk they apologized and sent a cleaning lady that took care of it immediately. Staff was extremely nice during our stay.,1
"We have stayed here 3 times in the past year. Since my first review, the wifi has been better and some of the rooms now have upgraded furniture, so that is nice. Usually I travel with my wife, who has the credit cards so checking in is not an issue. However this time I was by myself. Checking in to... More",1

"This hotel reminded us of a 1960's motel. We parked outside our room. Looks like they have finished remodeling and we were very comfortable. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and it was quiet. Plenty of charging outlets, free wifi, updated tv, and cold refrigerator for drinks. Desk staff was very... More",1
"The hotel was very clean, great employees, room perfect size, and pool and hot tub well kept. The location was perfect for shopping and getting around the city. My teenagers love the breakfast bar. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",1
For the price you can't beat the value. They are 6 minutes away from casinos. The rooms are decent. The hotel staff were very friendly. Freshly painted and updated. Not bad at all for price. It really is a perfect place for those on a budget who want to go to Boardwalk or casinos.,1
"Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers.",0
"I'm glad that we went through Expedia for a lower rate. I would have been very upset if we had paid full price. One of the elevators did not work. The air did not work in the whole building. Only the air units within the rooms worked. The place was very stuffy and seemed unorganized at times. All in all - since we were there for a Lax tournament it was decent. But, I would not go there for a get-a -way.",1
Stayed here while visiting family. Was close to local shopping areas. Easy access from I83. Front office staff were helpful and courteous. Breakfast in the morning was great. Would definitely stay here again.,1
"The hotel was nice. The hallways were nasty though. The floor looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months. The pool room was freezing. Couldn't take our 18 month swimming for very long. The hot tub stopped working our second day there. Was the same temperature as the pool. Otherwise, very nice, spacious hotel. Friendly staff. Just a couple of things to work on.",1
"I spent a whole day at this Holiday Inn for a conference. The conference room is well equipped, and the employees are always making sure everything is happening right. The space outside of the conference room is a bit cramped, but the lobby is ample so all the participants can move to the lobby is needed. It all looks clean... More",1
A great place to stay for business travel! Staff is very attentive/friendly. Constantly acknowledging you. Food at bar is top restaurant quality and it's conveniently located. Bartenders are also very friendly.,1
Great,1
"I have stayed at this facility, once or twice a year, going on some 30 years now. I travel by motorcycle - rain, shine, cold, and warm. The personnel I have interacted with are always first rate, helpful, and friendly. The facilities are clean, dry, and in my opinion, complete with everything I have wanted/needed/expected. The takeout facilities Sunset Motel... More",1
Bad: On one day our room did not cleaned until after 6.15 pm despite several messages. The front desk response was that the hotel was busy and it was not unheard of for rooms not be done at 6pm - and offered an apology as did housekeeping. We were more than a little surprised to hear this...most hotels are busy mid summer. We have experinced delays but nothing like this. We had to reschedule dinner appointment. As we were only there for 2 nights it was rather disappointing. Good: Location and facilities.,1
"Good: Love the location on the Chicago River. I liked the hotel before the Remodel. Dispointed no Christmas tree in the lobby. Bedding as always super comfy (I like Westin hotels). . I've stayed here many times and if the price is right will continue, however if your looking to walk into a hotel and get wow factor, this one is not for you.",1
Everything was great. Breakfast was particularly yummy with made to order omelettes. Only room for improvement is to increase number of luggage carts available in the lobby.,1
"Stayed there several times due to a courteous and helpful staff, great breakfast, comfortable beds, wonderful (and clean) swimming pool and easy as well as timely airport access.",1
"Stayed one night while in the area on business, and I was blown away by the front desk staff's dedication to superior customer service! Unfortunately didn't get their names, but the lady and gentleman that checked me in were kind, prompt, and told me several times that if I needed anything to call right away. Denesha checked me out in... More",1
I stayed at the Maya for three nights while my husband and I were working the Long Beach Convention Center. The Hyatt was booked. What a great opportunity that ended up being!

We enjoyed our stay. The bed was very comfortable. Staff very pleasant!,1
"This is the 2nd time we stayed at this motel, we travel for Craft Shows. Like the fact that you park off to the side and are on a service road. Ease of in and out makes it easy for us. Only problem is no breakfast available until 7 and we need to be gone by 6 am to set... More",1
"Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!",1
"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel was nice and clean, well maintained and friendly staff. I really liked the new look in the rooms and the breakfast was great many options. Hotel is located right off the freeway which was nice",1
"We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.",1
"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales",1
Really good hotel in the city and I have stayed in a few now. I would recommend to anyone looking for a modern good hotel with the all the right facilities.,1
I rarely if ever give a five star and I am not a fan of Vegas. This place was exquisite and the perfect place for a romantic getaway. You never have to leave the hotel area.

"Our room was sub-standard. Two of the four lights didn't work. The bath tub and sink needed to be cleaned. They both drained VERY slowly. While showering you had to stand in water up to your ankles.

"We read the other reviews on this motel and chose it based on these reviews, the pricing and the location, as it was right on our way to Vermont.

Within 15minutes of booking , Ramada had my reservations. :).",1
"Lovely big rooms, with big beds and the nicest bathroom I have seen in all our hotels on this trip. Sadly for us, the pool was closed for renovations and it would have been nice to cool off after a hot sunny day in California touring the wineyards.

We paid 339.00 plus 50.00 tax for a room that faced a busy to lane road..plus the entrance to the hotel...and dumpster across the street. Not a the stunning view of Sedona.

Everything was just lovely. The managers were friendly and helpful. The room was large and had everything we needed. The pool was clean and nice and the beach access was great. I wish we could've stayed longer!,1
"My family of four plus our best behaved child, Boston Terrier, stayed here on 6/20/16-6/22/16 and loved our stay. In fact, this hotel was the highlight of a week long driving trip through NC.

We recently stayed at the Comfort Inn Rensselaer - amazing room and a great staff. We were attending a family wedding and we're treated like family! We will definitely stay there again when visiting Indiana.,1
"when i saw the neighborhood i wasn't exactly sure. there are some brand new places/hotels nearby, but there are also some very run down places nearby also. all worked out very well for our stay however and everyone at the hotel was nice, the place was clean, and despite appearances there wasn't any trouble and we felt safe where we were",1
"We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.",1
"I needed a room near convention center, very satisfied.",1
Hotel stay was great! Good service and customer care as always! The live concert by river was enjoyable. Happy hour on patio at Colorado Belle was awesome. I really enjoy the 5 blackjack two deck tables.,1
"I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time.",0
Be sure to try the Landmark. Best breakfast we've found in the area. Great food and great service! We make sure to stop here we go to camp.,1

"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great.",1
"Hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly as well as informative.",1
"At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!",1
"Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue.

Also- upon check out- there were there cop cars at the hotel and one cop at the front desk discussing an incident. Didn't make me feel safe.",1

They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way.",1

"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.",1
"The outside of the hotel is not the most inviting. However, the rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. Other reviews say this hotel is not in the best area.

Found coupon at rest stop. 55.00 including tax is reasonable. The property is older with some wear and tear. Rooms are clean but nothing fancy. Old style analog TV. Adequate for a night's stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Easy to find. Close to shopping and restaurants. Right off the interstate.,1

"We stayed just one night on our way back to NJ from the University of Maryland, and decided to take the evening in Baltimore. The Embassy Suites is always a nice stay for us, particularly with the buffet breakfast. Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service). Otherwise, everything was great.",1
This is my second stay at this hotel and it is even better than the first time. The rooms are comfortable and the stay was great. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The Irish Pub on premises is a great asset.,1

"Just came back from the Littleton Inn. My fianc and I are not usually BB type, but this place looked adorable, The inn was excellent Mary was great! Quaint little New England BB at it's best. Hoping to go back in the very near future. Not enough good things to say.",1
Loved this hotel. The staff was wonderful. There was a complimentary shuttle to take you to the subway. We were there to visit Washington which was only a 35 minute ride so we did not have to drive our car. The complimentary breakfast was great with lots of choice.,1
"Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good. Staff very nice. Room clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets. Don't know why people complained about the continental breakfast. They had cereal, waffles, muffins, good coffee, juice, etc. in a clean environment. The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant. Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel. Good thing no noisy people tho. Second night rate (Saturday) was way overpriced for this place. Would recommend if only staying a few days. This motel is just a plain vanilla.",1
Bad: The cockroach in my bed- crawling on my liklow. Good: Staff was very nice!,1
"This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future",0
Good location. Excellent staff. Brilliant stay. Accommodation was clean and room spacious enough considering it is located in heart of the city. Magnificent mile on doorstep almost. Although hotel was full with nfl draft visitors the hotel maintains high standard. No hesitation to recommend,1
"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS",0
After a long drive we arrived to a great welcome friendly staff and free coffee!! Quick check in and very spacious rooms equipped with all necessities. Breakfast was lush could eat as much as you want and my partner ate about 4 helpings of different things!! We walked down to the beach the steps were quite a lot but we... More,1
"Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again.",1
it was nice!,1
"Nice hotel, but not enough people working there, which made check-in a drawn-out experience.",1
It's hard to find an affordable nice place to stay in this area. The price was great and so was our room. The only thing I'd change would be trays to take breakfast to your room because there was no where to sit. That's minor though.,1
"Only one major complaint is that the outdoor pool was not working. We were told it would be repaired and cleaned by the next day of our stay, but sadly did not. It was in the 90's during our stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were comfortable with white lines, and lots of pillows. Note on the headboard stating... More",1
"We stayed here after our cruise and chose this hotel because of its free shuttle and restaurant on site. Our room was larger than expected and cozy, we were able to get an early check in without calling ahead, and were in our room by 11am. The pool area is nice and clean, staff was helpful. Would stay here again.",1
"No surprises here, a great stay at this Courtyard! We were in town for 2 days prior to boarding our cruise and we loved our stay. For two adults, a child and a senior everyone was happy. The room was clean and nice size. The view of Lake Union from our room was beautiful and the location was great! Gym, great for the stay!Food in the restaurant, served its purpose and great to be on site!Service, fantasic!Very Happy with this stay!Thank you so much for your wonderful review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us before your cruise and hope to see you next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sincerely,Rachel Packard",1
"My wife and I spent our first anniversary here and loved it! The staff was incredibly kind and everything was clean and more than comfortable! It was only 45 minutes from Asheville so we spend the day in the city then drove back up in the evening. Cozy and warm, this place was amazing!",1
"I've stayed in this hotel many times, and it's always a good experience. The rooms have recently been renovated, making this an even nicer place to stay. The location is great...within walking distance to so much in Charleston.",1
"Our softball team stayed here for a tournament in Duquoin. This is just an average hotel. The bedding is badly in need of updating. The bedding had holes in them! Breakfast was ok. Waffle maker, muffins, cereal, toast, bagels. The hallways smelled like smoke, however the rooms did not. The staff was friendly and courteous.",1
"I should have reviewed the Robbins more carefully before making my reservation. I would have been far happier spending 30-40 more a night (and I am a THRIFTY traveler!). First of all, the room is not up to code: there was no smoke alarm. The A/C unit barely worked (probably because the filter needs a cleaning BADLY) and there isn't... More",0
"We were very pleased with our stay. Its worth getting a water view. It has a great view of the bay from the balcony. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The price is great compared to other water view hotels, and it was worth it. We were a little worried something would be lacking, but that was not the... More",1
"Good: The bed was extremely comfortable, and the staff were friendly. Especially, one that sent us free champagne and strawberries dipped in chocolate to our room. It was our honeymoon so it was sweet of him to do that little act of kindness. The outdoor pool was romantic! I love how it's open 24 hrs! we went for a night swim and saw the lights from the High Roller.",1
We went to the room and it was so nice I went to the desk and reserved the room for an extra day. we were going to leave Saturday but we added that extra night. We left Sunday wishing we could stay longer.,1
Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!,1
"Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally.",1
"I had pleasure of dealing with the most professional, sweetest, person in the hotel industry. It was very stressful time with planning son's wedding, arranging for rooms and breakfast the next day --- Deanna took all anxiety, fears, and took the bull by the horns and made everything one of the most beautiful days of my life. I have been... More",1
"We stopped at the Hampton Inn Kingsland on our way home from Naples, FL (the half way point). The hotel was very clean, beds were extremely comfortable, and breakfast was great the next morning before we hit the road on the final leg of our trip. The Steakhouse across the street was perfect for dinner!!",1
"Hotel is nice, clean....bathroom vent was extremely loud annoying and patio door was very hard to open and unlock. But overall, stay was good!",1
"Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again.",0
"I was impressed as soon as I walked in the lobby. It was neat, clean, interesting and nicely decorated. Also, just walking down the hall to your room. It zig zags a bit but its so much nicer than walking down a straight hall of doors. Likewise, room large spacious, 2 queen beds, separate living area with a pull... More",1
Beautiful hotel. Rooms clean. Pool very nice. Restaurant in hotel was excellent- food and mix drinks delicious. Only critique would be needing to ask for more than 2 towels (in a room we checked in with 4 ppl).,1
"Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome.",1
Country Inns suites was a good choice for parents weekend at Cornell. Rooms We're comfortable Clean. Great Location to easily get to the University. Breakfast was well prepared many choices both hot Cold buffet.,1
Totally disgusting!! Room smelled of mold. Flushed the toilet and water leaked all over the floor. Went to the desk and the jerks handed me a towel and a bucket to catch the leaks!! Then they charged us twice but my bank cancelled the second charge. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING THERE!,0
"This hotel is beautifully located in the NE corner of the French Quarter. It is one block to the trolley station on the newly completed Rampart Street line. I give the trolley system 5 stars for convenience, value (3.00 per day), and ease of use. The hotel itself is somewhat clean on the surface. The laminate floors in our unit... More",1
"This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit.",1
"Bad: Crazy static electricity in the rooms during winter. Good: Awesome place, and service.",1
"The suite was nice and roomy, however the carpet in the whole hotel was dirty but staff was cleaning the hall carpet before my departure. The shower door was off track and the sink in the kitchen stopped up but staff remedied the problem. The hotel was in a very good location and is accessible to metro and the highway.",1
"Very good experience. Easy on and off the interstate. Comfy room, Quiet, well appointed, clean (and I am picky). Competent and welcoming staff. I would come back to this hotel if I was in the area again. Would also recommend it .",1
"Good value, had a shuttle to our concert, friendly staff. The room was clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful at check in. Told us about the shuttle to the concert and gave us the taxi number.",1
"Excellent adventure. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool. Clean and maintain. Staff friendly. Close to food, shopping and trans. Staff made us feel comfortable and special. Will be back",1
"This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle. The Light Rail from Westlake Center can take you right out to Sea-Tac. We'll be back!!!Sarah P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge",1
Our stay was okay. The room wasn't too bad. Bed was kind of uncomfortable and door frame had a gap into the hallway so we got to hear everyone's conversation that walked down the hall. if someone had wanted to look.in they could have!,1
"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture).",1
Perfect,1
"I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar.",1
"Very friendly, great location in the French Quarter very comfortable. It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying. I give it a 5 star rating.",1
"This Rodeway Inn was recently converted from a TLC. For some reason the people who worked there wouldn't admit it had been a very recent change. The lobby has been retiled and the halls are being repainted. Breakfast was very basic-although a it included a waffle machine. The whole hotel is supposed to be non-smoking, but we were uncomfortable because... More",0
I have stayed at the Lofts on Pearl for the past couple of years following a Bills game. The rooms lack nothing. They are perfect as well as the staff. They are so welcoming and take care of our needs while we are visiting . Beautiful place !!!!!!,1
Good: Loved the area. Very quiet.,1
Good: Bathroom was large and the speakers in the wall,1
"Meant to book Sky Suites due to great previous experience, mistakenly booked Tower Suites. Complementary pick-up drop-off at Airport makes a huge difference to the overall experience. Separate check-in and lounge does away with long wait at check-in, lounge also offers snacks light breakfast. So far, comparable to Sky Suites but not quite so up-scale. Suite itself was... More",1
"My daughter, granddaughter and I stayed one night. The front desk lady seemed very stressed and was in a pretty bad mood. We were told to come back after 3 pm to check-in. As this was my first impression of the hotel and its staff, I was a little disappointed. We came back after 3 pm and the gentleman who... More",1
"Decently clean room, but beware if you have allergies. Hotels should offer an alternative to goose down pillows. Hypoallergenic pillows would have been nice instead of having to buy my own. Also, a/c unit in room was quite loud.",1
"Regular room--smelled a touch of room freshener. Clean secure, good deal, great location for downtown. Great restaurant across street. Easy to get to commuter train for dwntwn LA (45 minutes).",1
I have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn a few times. It has a very convenient location to the Raritan Center and many restaurant options. It is always clean and the staff is excellent. The hot tub is really hot.,1
For the most part we enjoyed our stay. We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger. We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay. The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates /or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator.,1
"Large rooms and comfotable The rooms are very comfortable, however the road outside is noisy so sleep patterns are interrupted Breakfast is on your landing so a bit like boarding school!",1
"The hotel is a bit pricey for MY pocketbook but I think it's because of the time we went (Capital Jazz Fest). However, for all they offer it was worth it.",1
Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location,1
"This was a clean and very acceptable basic motel. We got in late, went to bed, showered in the morning and left.The owners were friendly and easy to deal with.I would definitely consider this motel for a subsequent visit.",1
"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. Best regards, Jonathan",1
We have children and this hotel fit our needs like a glove. The room was decent size with two queen beds on a wed night for 105. The room had a shared balcony overlooking the creek. The hotel had a wonderful play park area for the kids to play. The breakfast food was awesome. The breakfast staff were the nicest... More,1
We are repeat guests to Ramada but sadly this will be our last stay as we will be looking to take our family elsewhere. This was our first vacation that we could not wait to get back home. I am employed at one of the leading hotels in Barbados and was very disappointed with the service of the hotel and... More,0
Love this out of the way place. Comfortable bed. Clean room. Clean bathroom. Neat old wood floors that creak when you walk. The only downfall for some may be no WIFI in the room. You can go to a common area and tap in. Lovely quiet place. Office folk very nice.,1
"The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ...",0
Basic and a little under the standard i expect from a Best Western. Having the basin in the room as opposed to within the bathroom was not a feature that we enjoyed and the bathroom could have been cleaner,1
"Stayed at the Charles Hotel over Christmas / New Year with the family. The room, staff and hotel in general were brilliant. I particularly recommend the hotel restaurant, Henrietta's Table, serves marvellous locally-sourced food.",1
"I stayed here while on a work-related trip to learn more about the Army. I was impressed with the efficient and friendly customer service. The free breakfast, cookies and indoor pool were nice touches. The bed was comfortable and room was spacious. The toilet wasn't cleaned very well and the doors could use some attention. There's nothing worse than seeing... More",1
"Bad: The continental breakfast options vould have had more choices. Along with some breakfast items being available for the 11pm -6am. Good: The hospitality of Billiit when we checked in, as well as Alex who who helped with our luggage were very polite, and seemed genuine in their wanting us to have an enjoyable",1
Me and my family recently stayed at the Sea Captain Resort as a last minute get away. This place is very small and quiet. They offer breakfast on the weekends. They also have free parking and Wi-Fi.

"I stayed last year and room was great. This year - complete opposite. The mattress was bad, the sofa was stain with who knows what!!! It was just a filthy disappointment - as I highly recommended this hotel based on my experience the prior year. I WILL NOT RETURN to this hotel. However, the staff at the front desk was friendly - the only good thing about this stay!!",0

We are pleased that you enjoyed your mimosa at our iconic King Cole Bar, and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Kindly, Senih Geray General Manager",1
"Stayed at this hotel for one night and the rooms were nice, clean, but slightly small. The staff was very good and made the stay as easy as possible. The lounge had a good crowd and the food was also good. We did use the banquet facilities and the food was fine too.",1
"We have stayed here the past 4 years. As usual, the rooms are very clean. The owners and staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome. You have a view of the Lake right in front of you. Our room has a mini fridge and microwave. We have stayed in the kitchen rooms and those have everything you need.... More",1
Bad: Shower. Good: Doorman was wonderful- very helpful.,1
We had 4 rms for family reunion. Our stay was a great experience. All our family needs and requests were met and service exceeded our expectations. The rms were clean and restful. The kids had a balst in the pool and breakfast exceeded our needs. Great job tonthe intire staff in Arizona,1
"Hotel looks great, staff was attentive, parking was congested and hard to find!!",1
The hotel was fine. It was in walking distance to the convention center. The room was clean and comfortable,1
"Hotel staff has been very accommodating and making my stay a wonderful one. They have went out of their way to ensure the smallest details are taken care of, just to make my stay more comfortable. The Paradise restaurant and lounge is second to none here in Moses Lake. Everyone is so friendly and courteous, especially Lisbeth. I recommend going... More",1
The service was TERRIBLE and the room was very very dirty..,0
The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The hallways were somewhat dirty(rugs not vacuumed on a regular basis)The food was okay which is fine since we ate out alot. I would definitely stay again.,1
"The hotel I stayed is so-called a 3-star hotel, here was no hot water in my room and I couldn't take shower. Also the A/C in my room didn't work well either, and it cannot give me a comfortable temperature. Then I asked for additional blankets, but they said all were gone. Given such a bad situation, they said they... More",0
"I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking.",1
Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!,1
"We stayed at the Aria 3/23/16 - 3/27/16. Our room was 22118 of the tower suites, the view of the strip was spectacular! The room itself was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bed, let's just say, I wish I could have taken it home with me. Amazing comfort. The staff at the Aria was amazing.... More",1
We had small children with us- the room was large and accommodating. We have a child with special dietary needs and loved having a full size refridgerator to store his formula. Staff were all very friendly.,1

"I was a little worried upon driving up to the hotel, as the outside looked a bit rundown. Upon entering however, it was like stepping back in time. Absolutely beautiful lobby area!

This is a great place for the price. The BWI Ramada has all the amenities that 1972 has to offer. Double check your shot record and book today.,1
The air blowing from the furnace made the bedroom either too cool or too warm. Other than that I couldn't have been more pleased with every aspect of our stay at Sonesta. Thank you!,1
I like the room...rooms was clean plenty of towels..tv's was outdated...pool was clean and warm...need more parking overall great stay i would stay again....good location to all activities,1
"Picked this hotel because of its best location right across Disney's gate. Room was just fine, not spotless and a bit tired but we could sleep well for 2 nights. Good breakfast. The on-site Cold Stone ice cream was yummy and having I-HOP next to the hotel was a plus. At the time of our stay the rate was quite... More",1
I can't say enough about this place! They thought of everything! We even used the laundry 50c for wash 50c for dry) since we were on a long trip from Tulsa to Sedona and back.

The room did have its own bath (you pay extra for that) but it was small, small, small. It smelled dusty, there was barely room to turn around, only a bed and two tiny nighstands. Where do you put the... More",1
"This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus, Staff are very polite and treat you as family member",1
"Helpful and friendly staff. The room was newly renovated and very nice. It was clean and just big enough for the three of us. The fridge and microwave were perfect! Best of luck to the new owners...and I'm sure we'll be back again! Thank you, we had a wonderful stay!",1
"We/I have been staying at the Baymont several times month for a week at a time since 2013 The front desk staff are ALWAYS friendly and helpful, my room is clean and stocked. If there are ever any problems, they are addressed immediately. It makes me feel like Im an owner, not just passing through. Thanks!",1
"If it wasn't for the carpets, this would have been a decent place to stay carpets are chemically sprayed on and it adds an irritating smell to the room-watch out for people with respiratory issues. Otherwise, staff was helpful and friendly. Location is not that great, but it's an ok stop on the road with some restaurants within walking distance",1
"This hotel was great! Our company held their meetings there we had catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner by the hotel. At night after our meetings it was great to go to the Casino and the tavern was a cool hangout place.",1
Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.,0
This was a very beautiful hotel. The rooms were small but clean and quaint. The hotel was located within walking distance from the saturday market and other downtown activities. We had desert in the hotel bar and it was delicious.,1
"Even if it was just for a night passing through, everyone was amazing. The room was clean, we were not bothered at all, the staff was very helpful when needed, everything was quiet when it shouldve been. Amazing. Will definitely come back.",1
"We booked the room after purchasing tickets to see Paul McCartney at the US Bank Arena in Cincinnati. It was the hotel that was suggested on the arena website.

A shopping trip with my cousin. Two day stay at the Hampton. Outlets were close by and we had a very nice stay. We will return. The beds were so clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and lots to choose from. Staff was very nice and helpful.,1
"We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something. I called front desk back and asked for another room. They did not have one with two queens so we took a king. The front desk asked if we wanted a roll away and I said yes. We left for dinner and when we returned, no rollaway. I did not call desk back. All of us crammed on the king bed.",0
"The lobby looked nice and half way updated. Checked in got into room and immediately the smell of musty air conditioner, decor was outdated nothing close to the lobby and the first floor. Oh and there is no elevator and as you walk up the steps to the 2nd floor you see the paint and trim on the walls peeling... More",0
"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too.",1
"I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites.",1
"Spent 3 nights at the BW Pluss Inn at the Vines, located just outside of downtown Napa. Perfect location for what we needed. Recommend using Uber for transportation, so easy and fast. It appeared that there was plenty of parking available in the downtown area, but we preferred to walk and enjoy.TwinCityGrl - Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are conveniently only 1 mile from Downtown Napa, so a quick cab ride away and you're in the heart of everything. We hope you come and see us again soon.",1
Have not stopped at a Drury Inn in quite a while. The last time we did was not a good experience. But because of the reviews decided to give Drury another chance. Glad we did. Do not hesitate to stop at this hotel.,1
"Hotel looked very nice and modern, rooms are very comfortable and have refrigerators which was great for us to store drinks. Room was very clean and the ammenities were plenty. Only thing is that rooms have LCD's but no HDTV cable, so quality of image was not what it's supposed to be. Check-in/out was very prompt and efficient. Will definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC area.",1
Keep driving! The other family that we were traveling with booked and paid for this room far in advance. We arrived without the other family and was given a room on the second level. When my husband and I exited the elevator with our luggage the entire length of the hall smelled like a skunk had run down it. It... More,0
Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the city. Had other obligations that put us on a short time schedule. Hope to visit again in the future. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were there for a 86 year old Aunt's birthday.,1
"Staff was friendly. Breakfast was great, especially the coffee! It was very modern and up to date. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we requested a non smoking room, and unfortunately the room smelled like cigarette smoke. They did spray the room, but it only improved it slightly.",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions,0
It's was very comfortable and clean no problem,1
"It was a very nice, clean hotel with friendly staff. Breakfast was cafe style but not free with stay. It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to warm up the coffee but it did have a small fridge.It had a nice pool and fitness area.",1
"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I",1
Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.,1
"In Cleveland on a weekend trip to visit my daughter. We booked through Travelocity and got a more than reasonable rate for airfare and lodging at Aloft. The hotel is hip, modern and new. It's in the center of a growing nightlife on the water front of downtown. Our room faced the popular Punch Bowl club and it was clearly... More",1

"One room key didn't work, carpets in hallway and at door filthy dirty, as for carpets in room, due to color, not able to see as much, but, come on, if outside door is visibly stained and dirty, what's expected inside. Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!",0
Bad: The floors need more thorough cleaning. Good: Nicely situated hotel in Miami Beach. Pleasant architecture with patio-like outdoor seating area where you can relax. Friendly and helpful staff. Public parking one block down.,1
"Bad: Pool is small and quite crowded but it was hot an many people were trying to cool down and relax. Good: The bed was very comfortable, a extra touch with slippers and a bathrobe in the room",1
"I recently attended a conference held at ARIA Las Vegas. This was my first trip to Vegas but it definitely won't be my last! The conference accommodations were fantastic (room temperature was a bit too cold at times) however, I fell in love with this hotel. The ARIA buffet has so many international food options, I felt I was dining... More",1
This motel looks like it was once a family gathering place. There is an old swing set and gazebo. The theatre theme in the rooms is giving way to an update of the decor. The motel was our stopover between dives on the Osprey. There is not much choice in town unless you look to a bed and breakfast or... More,1
Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope.,0
"We spent the weekend here last week for a college visit and apart from having a floor full of teenagers visiting the hotel, we had a very good experience staying here.

"My experience in this hotel has been one of a kind. Everything seems to be on point. I would recommend this place to others. Also, great price! Full breakfast included. Nice!",1
"The room was great - bright, clean, airy, spacious. Bed and pillows were comfortable. I thought the common areas were fine as well. Breakfast was great. My only complaint is that the halls and lobby are a little shabby looking. Carpet's worn front desk was sloppy. However, if I ever need to stay in Columbia again, this will be my spot.",1
Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.,1
"Stayed for 1 night, and the lobby and breakfast area are beautifully decorated and nice. Easy to find location with plenty of parking, but parking can be a hike if you dont get there before rooms fill up. Room was put together, and looked nice, but fan didnt work in bathroom, towels were slightly tattered on edges, and curtains didnt... More",1
The location is great and the rooms are very spacious and very comfortable. I will recommend this to anyone.,1
"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite. Please know this is extremely important to us and we have our maintenance addressing this concern as we speak. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge",1
"Last minute decision to stay here. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Cheap price got us exactly what we expected - a no frills, bare bones room. Convenient location right off I75 South, next to lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods. Little tricky finding the entrance at night. Pool area looks like it would be good in the summer.... More",1
"Bad: The doormen could have reacted a bit quicker to open the inner doors, which were very heavy. They sprang into action for the outer doors, but saw a dad with buggy struggle to get through, and people with cases, let in through the outside door, and having to open the inner door themselves with luggage. Good: The welcome was great. Staff were helpful and interested. The room was stylish and spacious, with great facilities in the room like iPod Dock.",1

"I use the net for work and this Hampton inn has theirs set so slow it is unusable. And no this was not prime time. If you need bandwideth do NOT stay here. The download speed is only 90K, that's a Kbyte not an M. Try a Marriot brand maybe you will have better luck.",0
Bad: The bathroom could have used a better cleaning before check in. There was hair left in there from someone else. Good: The nicest friendliest staff ever! So accommodating to our needs.,1
"This is a very nice place. Rooms were decorated nicely, roomy, and cool! I loved the seating area by the pool, but it does get a bit loud with all of the kids. Would have like an outdoor seating area away from the pool/kids. Wifi was fast, breakfast was good, and there were lots of green spaces for our dogs.... More",1

"The good stuff: The staff and the food. The Benson has excellent staff and both their restaurants have good to great food. They serve good coffee. The coffee is available in the lobby by 5:30am. It's also fairly quiet for a downtown hotel. Some of the trendier, better furnished hotels downtown are very loud. The location. Excellent location. The bad... More",1
Bad: Limited TV channels and no refrigerator or coffee making facility in room. Good: The free parking at the hotel was great and all the staff were very helpful and polite.,1
"Hotel Sutter is an interesting, historic building. Considering its age it was comfortably air conditioned (108 degrees outside during our stay) and the staff,,,,,,just deliteful!

The rooms are clean, large, and have wonderful views. The staff are always welcoming and friendly. We will continue to stay here whenever we visit Pittsburgh!",1
Place needs work. Staff was not friendly other then head housekeeping and Paul the bartender . Bed was comfortable. For having not much in the area the prices were high for a budget hotel. out dated only good for one night if that,1

There was a deck, and a full kitchen. The closet included various items and left little room for clothes. The washer and dryer were extremely loud. The livingroom was... More",1
"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
"I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.",0
Bad: Breakfast - hardly adequate. Good: Location and value for that location. Easy to get to - right across from bus station to/from Logan airport. Room was small but comfortable and updated.,1
"Clean, comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff!",1
"There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out.",0
Unreal facility and it is connected to the new Duke's Beach House restaurant which is fabulous! Beach is drop dead gorgeous with plenty of sea turtles. But in order to really make it happen find Dawson Chasity and they will make your vacation perfection. Best customer service anywhere. A really wonderful place to vacation!,1
We booked at Grand prix Motel last minute for Jeep week 2016. I was a little skeptical due to the stories you hear about outdated motels and the few bad reviews.

Accessible to any places you want to go. Not that much of amenities in the hotel but still safe and cozy to stay in. Everyday they have Craby Hour - Free food/drinks.,1
"We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!",1

"This comment is solely based on the Customer Service provided by the night time attendant (ANDREW) that checked us in. I am positive that had Andrew not provided the service when and how he did, I would have called 311 to express my discomfort (caused by other hotel guest) and demanded a complete refund. Andrew the Pena Family thanks you for your understanding and professionalism. -dez",1

Nice for a place to lay your head at night while you explore the city during the day,1
"There were no towels or blankets in our room. When I called the front desk, they made me come down to pick up the towels. They said that they were out of blankets.

"Bad: We came in the evening after a long business journey and I was pulling the luggage for me and my assistant in and there was no one to assist me , two people walked by and the third finally asked me if I needed help. I was not please. Then, I had booked a room with two beds and they sent me to a room with king size bed. I had to go back to front desk with my luggage.

It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel.

"The hotel beds were very comfortable, I slept like a baby.",1
"Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding. When we entered, the casino was very smoky and hot. They definitely need to move the air around better. The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them don't run well. The service in the restaurants was very slow. The room itself was spacious, clean and well priced. We had one day for a pool day, the temperature was 94 degrees. Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day! Also, the pool amenities were all closed down. Huge disappointment -- huge! We would not have stayed here if we would have known. I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value. If you would like to have the massage of your life, go see Elvira! She is awesome.",1

"Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure.",1
"Pros: - Clean and comfortable - Good housekeeping - Fast and free Wi-Fi - Great complementary English-style breakfast with lots of hot food such as sausages, pancakes, eggs, English muffins, etc. - Next door to a supermarket Cons: - Commute to Washington by car can be a nightmare during morning rush hours (took more than an hour to get there even though it was only about 20km) - Location a little ghetto with non-guests hanging around the hotel front door and lobby",1

"The South Street Hotel costs about one-half of the rate at the Hanover Inn. True, you do not look out your window onto the Dartmouth Green, but you can walk to it in two blocks. Our room was spotless and comfortable, the staff is welcoming and helpful. The only quibble I have with it was the air system seemed to... More",1
"We go back every other year and always stay here. The location is perfect, the hotel extremely well maintained and the service a cut above. There truly is no other place we would stay when in town. The proximity to the market and restaurants also makes it one of the most convenient.",1

Looking forward to returning to the property to spend a little more time there to explore the Monkey Board rooftop lounge.Dear 200Williamsf, many thanks for your super nice comments about this new and fun life style hotel in The Big Easy! We can't wait for your return for another Monkey Board rooftop bar and dj music experience. Ron Olstad, General Manager",1
"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting.",0

The hotel is just right of I95. Very easy to get to DC from here. The Franconia metro station is also near by. The breakfast options are the hotel are also pretty good.,1

"We were visiting family in Portsmouth, so this location was convenient for us. The hotel is on a street off the highway and by itself, so it is a quiet location with field and woods views in the back. On our first morning, the breakfast buffet had no food left by 8:30AM, so we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get anything to eat. On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door. When we did get new cards, we found our room had not been cleaned and only one towel was left for all of us to shower. In spite of the glitches, we would use this hotel again.",1

Front desk staff really embodied the aloha spirit. Chech in/out was the smoothest process I ever experienced. And they took the time to customize our accommodations. Heated pool and fresh homemade waffles at continental breakfast was an unexpected treat. Hotel is energy concious which I loved about them. And what's not to love Great location + great service great time.,1
"Good: the location was perfect, the hotel spa was very good with variety of service, the staff were extra friendly the room was clean. would defiantly come again.",1
"Very comfortable , excellent bed, very good value as well as being right in the heart of Wall. John is an excellent host, with local knowledge,more commending an excellent place for supper. Definitely would stay again.",1
"Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining.",0
"We stayed here on the last night of a cycling trip from Jax Beach to Sarasota, FL. The location on our route was perfect, but beyond that, it was a disappointment.

Nice hotel and very nice staff. Big problem with the hotel internet WIFI which attacked our computer with a virus that our virus protection was able to detect and remove...but it made the WIFI unsafe and therefore unusable for our entire three-night stay.,1
I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis. Upon arrival I thought the hotel was very nice. We were greeted by one of the owners and she was very helpful. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and we did... More,0

The staff was welcoming and accommodating, room was clean and comfortable, and the free morning breakfast had many choices and was delicious. It was a pleasant experience and will absolutely stay here when we pass through again.",1
I thought the overall experience at the hotel was very good. The only thing I did not like was that the cleaning of the room was late in the day after 2pm.,1
"I've stayed here several times and the service here is always above and beyond the call of duty.Clean rooms,great breakfast bar and we love Helen to death! Highly recommend this rest stop! 5 stars! You will be glad you stayed here!",1
Close to downtown. That was about the only good review I can give. For a Westin The cheap thermostat causing the air conditioner not to stay at a consistent temp. down to the cheap supplied hair dryer that takes 30 min to dry a short hair person. Hope you like the neighbors because you will hear them coming and going all night long.,0

Needing to watch our budget was what led us to 4 Flags Inn. We did not expect a 4 Star Hotel just wanted an average one for our 6 night stay. We have used 4 Flags twice and would again. Things were not perfect we didnt expect them to be at such a low price but our room was neat... More,1

"This is an upscale, modern hotel with the camaraderie of a hostel. The huge lobby has a giant fireplace, a billiards table, and a full bar, where guests were hanging out and socializing. Our room was attractive but smallish. The only hassle was that they charged for the breakfast on a per-item basis, which was mediocre quality and expensive. However,... More",1
"Spent 2 nights and had 2 rooms. The rooms were ok, average nothing extra special. My room had a portable air conditioner which I thought was odd even though the other one worked.

I have been going here for years and stay 5-6 times a year. The... More",1
"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.",1
"Every Year myself and some friends go to the dells to hit up the bars. This hotel is right downtown, so you are walking distance to all the bars. The owners were very nice. Now the rooms are just pretty much two beds and a TV. There is nothing special in the rooms. They are clean and do not smell.... More",1
"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit.",1
The breakfast could have been better by including some hot foods. The bed and pillows were very comfy. The rooms was nice and clean. The staff was very friendly.,1
"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",0
Love the atmosphere at this location. Got a workout in wish the Dumbbells went a little higher in weight stopped at 50lbs. Bar staff was awesome Gretchen was the best. The front desk did great when the shuttle got busy and provided us with a small token when the shuttle could not get to us for dinner.,1
It fine except they were partying until the wee hours in the morning,1
"Breakfast not as good as last time - air conditioner blowing on us while sleeping. Location, breakfast menu, comfortable bed",1
"The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city. The shuttle only was available every half hour, and was full most of the time. We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking. Not to mention that the hotel booked 4 wedding on one day. All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel, and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail. We had to park down the street and hope we didn't get towed. I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue. They couldn't be bothered with my issue. However, other guests stated that they were offered free valet, but then had to tip for the service. Definitely not worth the price considering it's no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range. Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with, but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her.",1
"I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Suites in Dodge City on my way to and from a training in KS. When I checked in on Sunday night, Paul greeted me and made sure I had a quiet room on the top floor. It was during a heat wave, and the bottle of water he offered was much appreciated.... More",1

"Bad: I guess the lack of facilities in the modern world. No pool, hot tub, gym. We got lost a few times walking down stairs, even went into their staff lounge and kitchen by accident. No free wifi anywhere! 10 a day per device.... Good: We loved being in the center of action and its great value. All the staff were very helpful.",1
"Room was dark, and smelled musty. Everything was well worn and in dire need up updating. Very mundane bathroom. Front desk staff was indifferent at best. I was so bad, we changed our stay from two nights to one and moved to a Hilton Garden Inn that was far better.",0

"Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast.

"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins.

"We visited a few hotels on our vacation and this one was by far the best. It was very clean, spacious and comfortable. Close to the airport. The complimentary breakfast was very good. We hope to come back again.",1
"Bad: Difficult to reach reservation staff (no tollfree number, nobody answering phone during business hours, long waits on hold), inflexibility in changing a reservation a week in advance, not enough towels, toilet too low and tub too high. A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries",1
"The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The accommodations were clean and convenient to all the local attractions.",1
"Ok, the room was clean. Spacious. Weird design where the bathroom door was a slider Desks attached to the wall covering the electrical outlets Appliances not plugged in...the refrigerator! No light bulbs in the fixtures Cleaning service doesn't remove the used coffee grounds",1
I didn't realize until after a Week later after my stay that I left over 100 worth of medical back therapy equipment. I didn't think to call but I have to admit I am disappointed that no one from the hotel bothered to contact me with these items that were accidentally left,1
"This hotel is clean and well kept. It looks to be newer than it actually is. It is convenient to stores and restaurants. The staff is friendly and courteous. The rooms are a good size. I found the pillows to be small and too soft for my liking. The only room available was for special needs, this was not expected. it lacked a bath tub. but the shower was ok. None of the soda machines worked correctly. It is not to close to the beach and there is no view of the harbor.",1

But great option if you are spending a few days in DC. I would definitely stay here again.,1
"Cheap comes with a cost. You must be desperate to stay here. Drug bust the day we stayed. Nice owners but wow. Everything is old, broken, stained and smelly. Never again. It is not worth the little money they charge.",0

"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food.",1
"Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side. Lots of younger people stayed there so if you are looking for a more boutique type of hotel that deserves the name you may want to look somewhere else. Good: The bed was very comfortable",0
Front Desk Staff was not very friendly at check-in. Breakfast was a trainwreck do to soccer team taking complete ownership of the breakfast area. I would recommend the hotel because of its convenient location between VA beach and Norfolk downtown aside from the poor treatment displayed by the front desk staff.,1
One of the most enjoyable stays. Everything was excellent.,1
"My stay was last minute as I did not feel like driving back to Columbus, I was welcomed at the front desk by Patty, she has been with the hotel for30 years (that says Allot about Red Roof inn as a company) it was her birthday, but she made me feel like it was mine...such a sweet welcome...offered me bottle water....and all I expected was a bed. THANKS PATTY!!YOU ARE AWESOME!! Happy birthday again!!!",1
Me and my family had a great time for a last minute trip,1

It is quiet and there is plenty off room at the hotel to sit and read, surfe etc. a bit expensive that is way we... More",1
"Rude desk person, smelly room. Initially, I politely asked to change rooms because of a funny smell. Instead of being polite and understanding, the desk person asked why I had not brought this to their attention last night and told me I could not switch rooms. She finally offered to let us switch rooms after looking at the room herself.... More",0
"Myself and my wife just returned from a week long trip to Maui. Here is an accurate review. Pros - This resort is beautiful It is practically brand new, has a great location with amazing views. We stayed in a one bedroom studio ocean view and our room was amazing. Great kitchen, spectacular views, and a comfortable bed. Cons -... More",1
Excellent customer service and the rooms are exceptionally clean. Would not think about staying anywhere else. The free breakfast every morning is great with a variety of options. Quick drive to the Redmond Airport and the shuttle service is very helpful.,1
I was very impressed with the rooms and felt like I was in an apartment. We stayed in a 3 bed 2 bath suite as a way for all the bridesmaid to be in one place the night before the wedding. The living area was very cozy and even with five people we never felt short on room. The kitchen... More,1
"Stayed at the Best Western Plus in Glenview overnight with a friend. She had a business meeting late that morning not far from the motel. We had time to eat the breakfast which was great as was the coffee. Usual fare of waffles, yogurt, and fruit. I must say that the scrambled eggs tasted homemade. The Canadian bacon was dry.... More",1
"We spent a night there while visiting our daughter. The location is perfect for shopping, dinning or sightseeing in Sausalito and right next ferry terminal if you want to go over to SF. Parking in the ferry terminal lot is easy and close but costs extra and it paid to the hotel. Our room was small but very nicely done... More",1
Awkward and inefficient front desk staff. Worst check in I've experienced. Hotel is dirty and room smelt like a wet dog. Fire alarm cords hanging from ceiling (with no alarm) and plastic cup secured over fire sprinkler.,0
"This is the worst Hampton Inn we have stayed in so far this trip. Drapes didn't close,so I had lights in my eyes all night. Control panel on AC didn't work, could only get cold or heat and that blew the flimsy curtains open. Nightlight wasn't working. Candy machine had melted candy. WiFi was extremely complicated to get on and... More",0
"Spent 5 wonderful days at the Pioneer Inn. Great place. Loved the rooms and the outside deck, comfortable beds, coffee maker, great location and friendly staff. Walking distance to everything. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Maui.",1
"Tim, Ken, and the rest of the Microtel staff went out of their way to make sure my girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay here they are wonderful people and they take great pride in running a top notch hotel establishment where every accommodation possible is made to make their guest feel at home. The rooms are very clean... More",1
I called to make a reservation to book for two days to attend for a convention and spoke with Rick. While he's taking to me I told him about the special package I wanted to avail and he said he will put me on hold for just a seconds. Guess what 25 minutes on hold so I called on my... More,0
"Older hotel needs updating past the front entrance. Rooms were big, but needed updating .",1
"Great location - very close to the freeway and conveniently located to the restaurants. we had a big family room on the first floor-- 2 queen beds, very nice bathroom and big closet! I will request for this room again when we are back to Coeur d'Alene. Their breakfast is great too. Staff service is excellent.",1
We come to the Dells every summer. We look to stay places downtown off the beaten path of the resorts. Indian Trail was excellent! Pool and grilling area were great. My husband and I loved playing shuffleboard and badminton on property with the kids. There was a nice wooded area to walk around in evening. Also the morning of our... More,1
Our family stayed in this Holiday Inn and Suites last weekend. We had side by side rooms but was a little disappointed that they don't have adjoining doors for the rooms. We had children with us and it would have been nice to have a way for them to go from room to room without having to go in the... More,1
"Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay.",1
"My stay was great. The hotel is nice and in a very nice location near the Richmond Convention Center and other important businesses. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Everything I needed was available the room even had a microwave and refrigerator. If by chance I may need to visit Richmond, VA again I would like to return to this hotel for another stay.",1
We got a great deal on a Queen Suite for an overnight stay during a wedding we attended in Clearwater. Suite was spacious and clean and could have easily fit six of us. Staff was friendly and location was conveniently located to some shops and restaurants. And about a ten minute drive to a really nice mall.,1
"We arrived early we were told we could check in at 11:30. We went did some running around came back. We were then told we couldnt check in until 1:30. Once we finally checked in we were told we had to put down a 100 deposit. That was not said when we booked the room. We were given a room with no view (houses) when we specifically asked for one with a city view so we had to go back downstairs get a new room. There was no refridgerator, no coffee pot, no microwave. We wont be back there. We could have stayed somewhere else that was on the strip for the same price and gotten more ammenities.",0
"Located in downtown Little Rock, I found myself only steps away from restaurants and other activities offered by this city. For frequent travelers, it's on par with what you would expect from the Hampton brand, added with some very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely my pick in Little Rock in the future.",1
"My family attended the Easter Brunch at the Crowne Plaza on March 27, 2016. We were a large party of 11 including 4 children. The food was fantastic. There was a great variety of breakfast and lunch foods, salads a variety of pastries and rolls and tons of desert items. My nephew hit the custom made to order omelet station... More",1
"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous.",1
"The people as we arrived were very courteous and helpful with our luggage, check in was easy, took us to our room and made sure everything was ok with us. We used the shuttle service to go to the ball park, Oscar, was great in getting us there. Check out was easy and our car was waiting on us when we came downstairs, the gentleman outside assisted us in loading up and gave us directions on how to get to where we were going to leave Houston.",1
Bad: Outside street noises were loud during the late night. Motorcycles racing and taxis honking woke us up. Might have been better with a room not facing Stuart Street. Good: Staff was friendly and helpful! Nice room.,1
"No wifi Simple breakfast with Egg, Ham and Sausage. Nice Coffee Late",1
"I stayed for 5 nights on a business trip. Very nice hotel. Friendly and welcoming staff. Very spacious rooms. Pretty good breakfast with a variety of choices to choose from. I also enjoyed the warm cookies in the evenings. If i'm ever back in the area, I would definitely stay again. I dislike the hardwood floors because I could hear... More",1
"Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!",1
I had such a great experience at The Aria Oct.17-20th that I didn't leave the property until it was time to Uber back to McCarran.I was there for the canceled Stones show and Aria was buzzing with a great vibe.Room 21228 was immaculate and housekeeping were on their game.Every single employee I encountered was genuinely polite and gracious.Some of the...

"The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon.",1
"Bad: Breakfast is exactly the same every day and if you spend there 3 or more days you need a little wider choice. Good: The hotel has an excellent location, and is in walking distance from the beach. The staff is kind, the room is fine and clean, the coffee is good, considering the prices this is a good choice. You can find nice restaurants nearby, shops and bars too.",1
"The breakfast was the only disappointment. Hard boiled eggs,sausage that the attendant had to warm in the microwave and add to the serving dish and then it was not hot. I was surprised to see her put the freshly warmed on top of the sausage already in the pan that was serving temperature. I was taught to remove old and place new in bottom and first cooked on top. The area is very small also. Train is close when it comes by in the night and may disturb others but we like trains.",1
I've stayed here a couple times and have been impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendly staff. I've stayed in many comparable smaller town hotels and the Fort Morgan Comfort Inn beats them all hands down.,1
"I stayed at this hotel for extended perios of time last year and through February of this year. Generraly, the hotel is nice hotel that ould have received a very good to excellent rating except for the treatment I received on my last few stays. Last year the rooms needed quite a bit of updating and as of February they... More",1
Great place close to beach,1
"The resort is very very nice. 4 stars all the way. The condos are well appointed, large and super comfortable - full upgraded kitchen, washer and dryer, 3 flat screen tvs, HUGE bathroom, plenty of closets, king bed, huge lanai with table and chairs. You don't want for a single thing while you're in your room. However, the resort is... More",1
Bad: fitted sheets on the bed kept coming off Kept having to fix the bed. Good: breakfast variety was perfect,1
"The room was a little on the to hot side and could not lower the temperature at all. The bed was not very comfortable. I believe it needed a new mattress. Other than that, price, location, decor, etc was great.",1
"This was my first and it will be my last. I don't believe these review regarding how spectacular the front desk is, when in reality they don't really help. I ask for a simple late check out and they couldn't grant it, I'm here on business so that extra hour could of help me move a better way but thanx... More",0
"Super 8 has come a long way in recent years. This one looks great from exterior, has friendly staff - something I have notice across the country in past couple of years. The room has a few nicks and scuffs around the edges, but is clean and comfortable. This is not a 5 star place, but ease of access from... More",1
We stopped at flagstaff for a point that was close to the Canyon and more affordable. The rooms were nice and clean. Very affordable and in good location near lots of places to eat. There was free wifii and access to computer and printer. Staff was friendly especially Chelsea Grissom. Continental breakfast was OK.,1
We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!,1
My son is a student at Salisbury University. I have stayed in several area hotels but the Hampton Inn in Fruitland is my favorite. The rooms are always clean and comfortable and the staff is always friendly and helpful. It is less than one and a half miles from the school and they offer a special rate for SU parents!,1
"This is quite a special hotel. It is unique in many ways its design, layout and furnishings are a pleasant change from the hotel norm. You feel comfortable in your room and the staff add to the level of comfort and welcome.Thank you for your comments...we certainly try our best to make it a special place. We hope you come back and enjoy it on another trip!",1
"Is it swanky No. Is it clean Yes! Tile floors throughout mean no gross carpets. Bathrooms all have nice, clean tiles throughout. Comfy beds with different pillows means you have choices. New windows block a lot of sound. We stayed in a downstairs unit but either the upstairs folk weighed less than 100 pounds or the place was built when... More",1
Good: HELPFUL STAFF,1
"I can only speak for the room I stayed in which may not reflect all rooms. I stayed in a two Queen bed room. The shower looked amazing, but when I took a shower there were two major issues. First, the water pressure or setting on the shower head was less than ideal. The amount of water spraying out was... More",1
"Other than the fact that our keycard not working when we arrived at our room on the 2nd floor, it was an excellent place to stay! The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Would recommend it to a friend.",1
"The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley. A very solid choice if you want a slightly cheaper option and don't mind not staying in a farmhouse!Thank you for your review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"Calm environment, great breakfast, helpful staff.",1
"If you want a stunning ocean front view, friendly staff, beautiful ground, and pampering rooms, SeaCrest Ocean Front Hotel is the place to be!!!! We have been coming to SeaCrest for years but this latest stay really topped it all. We were given a spa deluxe room with a fantastic view!! The room was spotless and not one thing was... More",1
Pontchartrain Hotel has friendly service and guest rooms that are beautifully appointed to the smallest detail to ensure luxury and comfort. The beds are lavishly comfy the bedding luxurious. The public rooms are opulent and welcoming. The homemade ginger beer was better than fever tree (my favorite) The bartenders are first-rate and the view from the rooftop are is magnificent.... More,1
"Staff was friendly, service was very good, hotel very convenient to restaurant and other stores, great freeway access, suite was very spacious, only issue their equipment in breakfast was not working at times.",1
The Days Inn Portage was just what I needed for a very quick overnight stay in the area before an event. The room was comfortable and I thought the rate was very reasonable for the area. The pool looked nice and I was sorry I didn't bring a swimsuit even though I didn't have time! The front desk was very... More,1
"My wife and I were celebrating our 23 year anniversary in the king jaquzi room , this is the most reasonable priced rooms but the last two visits the rooms need remodeling. This last stay the drawers were falling out of the dresser, a hole punched through the bathroom door didn't even raise an eyebrow from the staff.",1
"If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try. If you are real particular about where you stay, then you might want to try another motel. considering the money I saved and service I received, I would stay there again",1
"Clean, comfortable, free parking, free wifi, free breakfast. Great place to stay for a weekend in Cherokee. Friendly staff, nice water pressure in shower. Convenient location. Ask for a street view room with a balcony. Relaxing to sit, have a coffee, and people watch.",1
"The hotel offers nice spacious rooms. If you have a room on a higher floor you will have great views around the city. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The internet works well and is fast. The wellness area consists of a very well equipped gym, a large pool and a jacuzzi. You also have a terrace with sunbeds... More",1
"We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers.",1
"Il s'agissait de notre troisieme experience a cet hotel et nous avons encore une fois ete tres bien servis et surtout tres bien recus. Si nous retournons en Virginie dans les prochaines annees, nous ne chercherons pas ailleurs.",1
Bad: Nc. Good: GReat beds!,1
Bad: I didn't see that there was breakfast available at the hotel. Good: Location was amazing!!!! Room was a little tight for two but very nice,1
This is my second stay here at the hyatt. The staff are always friendly and happy to help you. The facilities included in the resort fee are well worth the money such as The 2 swimming pools Pitch and put golf course Driving range 3 full size golf practice holes Boats on the lake Also the new year balloon drop...

"As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community.",1
"I cannot say enough about this outstanding hotel. Everything was top notch! The valets and front desk went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, easy and memorable! La Jolla is so beautiful and upon our return we will only stay at this amazing property!",1
"We stayed here for one night in May on the way east to our daughter's college graduation. It is clean and friendly with cheery updated decor. The room was very large, and there was a separate area with a counter, microwave, and fridge. However the whirlpool tub is in the corner of the main part of the room. There is... More",1
"Hotel and staff were exceptional. Check in and check out were a breeze. The bedding was comfortable after a long day of travel. The breakfast was hot and delicious and included choice of eggs, bacon, oatmeal, waffle, choice of pastries and beverages. The room and bathroom were tidy. I will definitely return.",1
"For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though.",0
They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!,0
Desk clerk was very helpful when I called at the last minute to get room. She was very helpful at check in. A storm was coming and she even printed out a radar map to show us when the storm would hit.,1
"Thought this spot was great. Clean room and bathroom with excellent shower. Updated bathroom was very nice. Front help was efficient and friendly. Breakfast gal was hard working and helpful. My husband and I stayed only one night as we were passing through but if I were staying longer this hotel would be the place to stay. Clean, convenient and... More",1
"La nostra camera era pulita, spaziosa e il letto molto comodo.La colazione e la solita che si trova in questi posti,era ok.Abbiamo scelto questa struttura per un pernottamento, in viaggio. Rimane un po' fuori a Norfolk, ma e anche vicina da Virgina Beach e per cui era una ottima scelta, visto i prezzi che ci sono al mare. Consiglio questa struttura a viaggiatori o anche per lavoro senza problemi.La qualita ricevuta per il prezzo e buono.",1
"I was here with my husband and 2 young kids and enjoyed our stay! We booked using hotwire and was happy with the results. The one thing was a little nerve wrecking was that when I made the booking on hotwire, I stated 2 adults, 2 kids -- and we were given a room with 1 rollaway. We were offered... More",1
"We had an amazing time at this hotel, although it was a little noisy due to being near the highway, we felt that the location to down town and the awesome staff more than made up for that. They could not do enough for us to make our stay as good as it was. Joe the driver of the shuttle... More",1
The hotel room had the latest in modern technology all easily controlled by a tablet. The range and quality of the many restaurants was astounding. We loved the high end Mexican restaurant and the breakfast buffet...which offered a vast choice! I'm sure this is modern high end Vegas at its very best.,1
Awesome staff - excellent on providing customer service,1
"This was just an OK place to spend a night since it was close to our destination and was fairly inexpensive. You can tell it was an older hotel that has been renovated. Room was cleaned, but smelled of air freshener, probably to hide a smoke smell. Just didn't have that usual new Best Western feeling.",1
"Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location.",1
I love staying at the coconut Waikiki!! Everybody was so friendly and helpful!! The breakfast was amazing and the rooms so relaxing!! I loved waking up to the sunrise and how conveniently close the shops were. Bars were down the street with great happy hour and the royal Hawaiian center had plenty shops and a food court! Minutes away from... More,1
"The 1 asset of this motel is its proximity to the beach which is just one block away. The room was quite large and included cable TV and a kitchen. Bedroom and bathroom were clean but kitchen could have been a little cleaner. Ok, if you are a nitpicker you rather should stay in the Marriott 2 blocks away, but... More",1
This is one of the nicer BW properties that we have stayed at. We stayed here overnight after one of the Oregon State night football games in Corvallis. Our room was very clean and quiet. It had a very comfortable queen bed. We liked the separate sink from the rest of the bathroom. Our room and the lobby were nicely... More,1
Good: Lovely helpful staff,1
"I first read the reviews of this hotel on this site and mostly all said great things about this hotel and i can see why. When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time.....",1
"It was NICE, The room was clean and close to where I had to conduct business the next day.",1
Great location for city tours. Comfortable room. LOVE the courtyard for a nice drink after walking all day. Good breakfast buffet.,1
"Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare.",0
"Great place to stay while doing the Charleston tourist attractions. Much cheaper than staying downtown, and the shuttle bus takes you into the city from a stop just outside the hotel, so no parking charges.Some maintenance issues with the room which were not all fixed during our stay. Internet was slow but free. Breakfast was the usual HIE fare.Staff were all keen to help, but the hotel is probably feeling its age.",1
My friends and I stay in TC every year for Girl's Weekend and love that the pool is 24 hours. Highly recommended to anyone that needs a room. Clean with a great breakfast!,1
The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again.,1
"I was in Sierra Vista for 8 months working a Gov't contract at Fort Huachuca. The Quality Inn is the only Hotel that accepts the CLC cards. Very unfortunate for me! The Hotel needs a lot of repairs and upgrades. The location is perfect! Just down the street from the Mall, shops and restaurants. Interior carpet needs replaced. Had trouble... More",1
"Fabulous location. Conference facility, bowling, restaurant, pool, hot tub, and fitness facility all close together AND an incredible view of the Lake. Rooms were easy to get to. My only criticism would be the elevator. It took a long time to move between floors and it abruptly closes the micro second you press the floor button.",1
Good: Boutique type hotel. With At Home Feeling. Nice atmosphere for the price!,1
not able to check in till after 4:30pm and had to acquire hotel manager in order to get in even at that time. We then were given a room with i think handicap shower...had no tub..water went on floor...upstairs must of had the same because their water dripped from our ceiling,0
"It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan",1
"Over night stay on business room was in good shape a lot of newness and clean Breakfast was ok, could use a waffle machine, some food in buffet could be fresher.",1
Staff was friendly... Clean room... great location... will definitely stay again. Right by the Superdome.. Not far from everything else. No ice machine on your floor but staff brings ice to ur room quickly. Again great stay.,1
"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.",1
"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room.",1
"We just got back from a 4 day stay here. Being from tucson the weather is just beautiful here right now. Our 2 bedroom cabin was very clean, definitely comfortable.

"We stayed there for only one night (thank goodness!) a couple of days ago.The reception staff, especially Kris, were good. However, that's where the good ended. The room was dingy and old - paint chipped, moldy smelling, etc. There was something stuck on the edge of the nightstand (pic). The TV remote was disgusting (pic) - I didn't want to... More",0
"Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests.",1
"The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1

The rooms had 2 double beds instead of 2 queen beds and there were no available cribs or cots for our room. The TV in our room did not work. Other guests were quite loud into the night.,0
"Just dreadful, and scary. Was traveling alone with my dog. We were so tired, just needed somewhere to rest. What a filthy room, and the door did not shut tightly, you could see light through it...which wasn't too huge a problem until I was awoken in the middle of the night to loud party or something, which quickly turned into...

"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards",1
Hotel is located in west Hollywood . We stayed here a night and I had a great experience . Staff was very helpful and the hotel was beautiful. We got a one bedroom suite with a balcony view overlooking the city. It was beautiful view both during the day and during the night. The rooftop was amazing. I totally recommend... More,1
"My wife had a birthday party at theHoliday Inn North Phoenix.The event we had was wonderfully planned by Phil McIlveen,the hotel's director of sales.He helped in planning a great party within our budget.Phil went above and beyond his limits to ensure that the event was successful.The staff were courteous and very ready to listen and help out wherever and whenever we needed them.We will surely have more events in the future at this location and we will send referrals to Phil.Thank you for the hospitality.George",1
A very nice Hotel with very friendly staff. The complimentary breakfast was ok but nothing great. The only problem we ran into was the indoor pool was being worked on so it was closed to us.,1
"The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway.",1
"Love this place. Wanda checked us in after 2 days of camping. She is worth her or my weight in gold !!!

"I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",0

"We drove up from the San Francisco Bay area to meet our son in Redding. He goes to school in central Oregon so his drive was a little longer compared to ours.

"Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money.",0
First of all they say they don't rent rooms to florida residents unless you put up a deposit but they don't tell you this until you get there when it is to late to cancel or make another res somewhere else. My weekend there the temp dropped down into the 40s and the room furnace did not work so cold... More,0

At that time reserved the room with choice points in the amount if 12,000 choice points. Ok I'm fine with that as long as they have semi parking.

"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More",1
"Nice clean hotel with a small restaurant inside. I was flying out of Reagan National airport and needed a place to leave my vehicle. Found this place on Parksleephotels.com, was able to leave my car there for a week for little more than the cost of the room. Free shuttle to the airport. It is a great deal.",1
The exterior and lobby were very unappealing. Very blah. The room was better--updated and clean. However at least 3 times water pipes clanged and thunked. One time was during the night and it woke of us. Not happy about that. The area around the hotel was only fair looking.,1
"Affordable, clean, excellent views to the pool and beach. Loved the music and happy hour along with family environment. Just wish there were handicap ramps to the pool/beach. There are two staircases to get to the beach and with physical limitations it became challenging to get there. Although once in the beach it's a short walk to the shore. Overall... More",1
I have stayed at just about every Disney World Property except the Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge. I have always been really impressed (except this time).

I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam,0
Chef Dean and Nicole are amazing! They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked into the Inn. Our room was excellent and the balcony view was great! The breakfasts were incredible. We plan on returning to Europa again very soon!!,1
I was not impressed with this motel when I stayed there - the breakfast was very mediocre and the toilet didn't want to flush.

"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Excellent family enjoyed everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived early gave phone number and they called when room was ready 2 hours before check in. Location wonderful for us, we walked every where. Direct access to beach. Outside pool great, food there was good too and not to pricey. Overall great stay. Well worth the price. U get what u pay for. Breakfast could have been a lil better, my personal opinion.",1
"Excellent breakfast, lot of variety. As a business traveler it's a big help. Appreciated the complimentary USA Today. Overall very good experience, would go back there again.",1
"Ideale per visitare Washington, la zona e gradevole e ci sono dei ristorantini, nonche fast food, per cenare di sera. L'hotel e dotato di tutti i confort, wifi, frigo in camera, noi lo abbiamo caricato di acqua presa in un supermercato vicino. Una bella sorpresa!!!",1
"The rooms had a lot of character. We enjoyed the Speak Easy room a lot. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The room was a bit smaller than anticipated. The walls are pretty thin and we heard the trash man outside every morning, even above the noise maker. Breakfast was good, but simple. We found... More",1
"Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great.",1
"Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all.",0

"All the kids enjoyed the nice size pool, comfy beds, and great breakfast. We had a blast and there was more than enough room to get our just dance 4 groove on! Can't wait til next year:)",1
Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!,1
"There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again.",0
Our room was comfortable and clean. The only drawback that we found was that we could not access the internet and the attendant did not know how to remedy the problem. The breakfast was excellent with several options to choose from.,1
"Traveling for work in independence Iowa. Weather forecast was not good. Decided to stay overnight. Lady at desk told me areas to go in case of tornado. Also reviewed sirens, as well as local restaurants. Very professional and informative. I highly recommend staying here!",1
Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff,1

The room was very clean and the staff at the front desk was wonderful/helpful! Nice to have a hot breakfast option too!,1
"Arriving here late at night I didn't really appreciate the beautiful surroundings until I woke up the next day, and the hotel itself was not too bad either. It was very confusing trying to find the room initially though. I believe I had to walk down a corridor, up a lift to Ground Floor, then across another lobby area, down... More",1

The location of this hotel is hreT for visits to my son. The room was clean and comfortable. I didnt have time to try the breakfast but I hear it's fabulous! I had a great night's sleep in a comfy bed! I will be staying here again.,1
"The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place.",1
Bad: Expensive. Good: Great location. Very clean. Rooms are nicely appointed. Large bathroom. Responsive and friendly staff. Perfect continental breakfast.,1
The rooms were fine and the staff was friendly but the high speed internet never worked. I kept getting excuses but was worthless. I would return if they fix the internet because that was my only real complaint.,1
"My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at the Grand Hyatt. We stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was just as good, if not better two decades later. The location is beautiful, the rooms are attractive and well kept, and the service is excellent. I recommend it 100.",1

"Best price hotel in the city! Great location, walking distances to everything! Staff was professional and friendly. If you needed something, they were on it! Our room was very modern, clean, and beds were comfortable. Very quiet for when you are ready to rest! Classy place.",1
Bad: We were initially given a room close to the gym on same floor - made it very noisy early in the morning so no chance of a lie in. We asked and hotel obliged with a room change to different floor. Good: Bed was comfortable,1
Excellent customer service. The purpose of my trip was getting surgery at LSI and the staff at this hotel location was spectacular! They could not do enough for me and my family. Thank you to the entire staff!,1
The room was nice. Didn't care much for the set up though. My kids slept on a sofa bed while I slept on the King. We couldn't watch the tv. You had to swivel it one way or another. There was a long table that divided the room from sitting to bed. The pool was small and very cold. Definitely not heated!,1
A very old hotel with old smelling bath tower and bedding fixtures refrigerator is only available upon request but came with broken temperature setting control knob and old floor carpet was not very cleanly vacuumed. The A/C works but noisy it would better be turned off if you preferred to have a quite sleep. The Complimentary breakfast is very good.,1
This hotel is old and it shows. They have updated some things but the layout is very inconvenient for getting in and out. The pillows are not comfortable and the toilet seat fell apart.

"The property is great, and the poker room is the best in Vegas. I've rated the Aria as excellent overall. Since no place is perfect, these comments will address only the imperfections. First, the poker tournament area is in the casino area rather than the poker room proper. It seems to be between two discordant sources of music and in... More",1
"During our recent stay at the Aria, my fianc and I experienced nothing but exceptional service. The hotel was incredible and amenities were great. We had a corner suite for a weekend and wish we could have stayed longer. Can't wait to book our next Vegas trip there.",1
"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.",1
"Very low rent establishment. Old and run down...but what do you want for 55 dollars We arrived, slept, and departed. I did not see any bugs. Old funky bathroom. A cast if characters from a Fellini movie ..",0
"We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay.",1
"Besides the rude customer service, overall it was great. The rooms are spacious and we had no problems at all. Everything worked well. The water park passes to Noah's Ark and Chula VIsta is a plus. We went to both water parks. Also the pools at the hotel are good. My god son enjoyed the area for kids outside.",1
We arrived at the hotel and experienced the wonderful front desk staff. The check in was quick and we had a room on the 42 floor. It had a great view. The rooms were very clean and had eveything you could need. The beds were so comfortable we didnt miss our own bed at home like we usually do. The... More,1

"The hotel caters to pets, and that's fine when you need it. The room was dirty (expected since there are so many animals involved). I would not stay there when I'm not traveling with a pet. Bathroom was okay typical for a hotel in this price range.",1
"This hotel will never be considered luxurious, BUT the charm, staff, and grounds make up for it. The rooms are comfortable and very functional. Close walk to old cocoa village, with great restaurants all within walking distance. I am local but still go out of my way to stay there!",1
I have never had to ask for a refund due to cleanliness of room. I asked for a refund on this very dirty room. The attendant lady was violently screaming and refused to give me a refund.

"The staff at this Microtel were wonderful, but the owners need to invest in new beds! Mattresses we're very soft and sagged in the middle. Breakfast was above average.",1
"This was a great value. We upgraded to a suite when we arrived to be near the pool. The room was huge and the staff was friendly although we could've done without the 7 a.m. wake up knock on our door from housekeeping. So don't forget to use your ""do not disturb"" sign. The free continental breakfast was generous and fresh. We would stay here again.",1
"Not much to complain about here. The resort is beautiful, the grounds are impeccable. The view from the lobby walking in is amazingly. Service at Dukes is great, food is good. Pool is loud with lots of families but you can escape all of that and head to the beach which isn't overly crowded. You can see lots of ocean... More",1

Upon check-out the next day , we noticed that the charge was different than confirmed and e-mailed to us by manager RG. Even after discussing the discrepancy with him... More",0
"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1.",0

Whenever I'm in the Alexandria, VA area, I always choose this Hampton Inn because of the service they provide and the environment while in their facility. The rooms are clean and comfortable while you are away from home.",1
The Maritime hotel is very nice. The room was small but clean and well accommodating.,1
"Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time.",1
Second time at this nice and modern hotel. As soon as you walk in the room the drapes open up. Pretty cool. Room is comfy and plenty of room. Beds are also comfortable. You can walk to the high end mall Crystals. I like that they have an air conditioned room to sit at while you wait for your car.... More,1

The room was outdated but yet cozy. Love the fireplace in the room. Even though no hot tub in our room we still had a relaxing time. Blast from the past! I would ask for or bring an extra blanket can get a little chilly if the fire place goes out. Will go back and stay again soon. Room 213,1
"We stayed in Room 1 of the carriage house which was cozy, quaint, and comfortable. Sitting on the porch offered a lovely view. Bass Harbor is off the beaten track much quieter than Bar Harbor, which is what we were looking for. Although we didn't stay in a cottage, they are quite large, with a kitchenette and several bedrooms.... More",1
Front hallway light was out when we first walked into our room. Super tiny bathroom but that was expected for the price. Only half the floor was carpeted and the remaining was super cold and hard on the feet. I had my house slippers but my husband had forgotten his. Great location in Rockford if you just need an inexpensive but convenient room for the night.,1
"Bad: The referbishment work started before 9am each morning and seemed to be right above our room, whixh meant we didn't get much sleep at all. Good: The location was great and the staff were fantastic. Special thanks to Darwin for our engagement gift which made our stay all the more enjoyable. I would stay here again!",1
The room had a funny smell and also dirt around the mirrors and stains on the sheets. The microwave also didn't work. Besides this it's a nice hotel And a great location. Oh and late check is only an extra 30 minutes not an hour.,1
This is the second time we've stayed here. It has very nice rooms with separate living room suites. It is cleaned and well maintained. Slight negatives mentioned above were breakfast and road noise. Slight because the scrambled eggs were watery while bacon etc was fine. Road noise was bad at 8:00 pm but by 10:00 it was pretty much gone.... More,1
"This hotel is in an awful area, and the pictures make it look really nice, in reality the pool is tiny and next to a car park, the water was freezing, and the general customer base at breakfast was a little out of my comfort zone.

Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods). The hotel staff is obviously carefully chosen and well trained. They were all very friendly and helpful. We felt so welcome. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone.,1
"I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that.

"Good location, near lot of general shopping and restaurants. The in hotel restaurant is excellent, highly recommended. The staff was very professional and helpful. Will stay here again when in the area.",1
Love it.,1
We stayed a night we were on a family trip the stay was so peaceful. The room was beautiful comfy bed and great channels. I would stay again when visiting that area. Also the staff was really friendly and professional.,1
"Nothing to complain about. Very friendly staff and loved it! Diana and Taylor were very helpful. Breakfast was great. Bacon, eggs, hasbrowns, waffles! It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",1
"It's like any other hotel at this class but the staffs were friendly , room was clean full break-fast plenty of food and drink , the shuttle service to and from subway(metro) is free anytime you like , it's worth the cost of hotel fare. I would recommend for quests who like to spend not much but want more amenities or service this is the right hotel to choose .",1
Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.,1

The bathrooms are the original 1950/60's which I loved. Excellent value for money. Staff... More",1
I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down.,0
Lovely hotel. The pool is small but was lots of fun for the young kids with us. The lifeguard was fantastic and gave the boys lots of toys to play with. Even in the cold everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance. We'll definitely stay here again.,1
"Bad: We had a 2 queen bed studio for 6 people. It was a little tight maneuvering with the pull out couch out,but otherwise was good!. Good: Staff was wonderful!!!",1
"The folks at the concierge desk are very helpful in directing you on where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown. The tub in the junior suite is large and oh-so-nice after spending the day shopping or walking the wharf!",1
Business as usual. Nothing special about this hotel except its location. It needs a major facelift.,0
"I love the front desk an the manager an the maintenance it was good which is why I was there in the first place because of the plumbing in my apartment i enjoyed the pool the colored lights was nice .Hello Faith, Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel 502. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay. Take care and hope to see you again in the near future.",1
"We stayed on the second floor of this property to avoid slamming car doors on the first floor. For those who wish to park outside their room, this is a great option. There is no elevator, but it was not a problem for us. The public areas are clean and well-lit. We received a warm welcome from Kate when we... More",1
"We were looking for a low cost motel in Kings Beach for a weekend of skiing at Northstar. I was shocked at the number of places that had disastrous reviews, but was pleased with the reviews from Ferrari's. So I made the reservation and kept my fingers crossed. We checked in, went up to our room, opened the door, took... More",1
"This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay.",1
"We stayed one night while on a road trip to Chicago. If we ever pass through Fort Collins again, we will definitely be staying at this hotel. It is conveniently located (restaurants, and pretty strolling all around), and if you request a quiet room, you night not get a view, but you will get a very good night's sleep. Parking... More",1
"Bad: in old town, far away from new main strip noisy air-con in room decor abit old. Good: cheap buffet with good quality big room comfort bed",1
"I stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday evening for a pre-conference workshop. It was quite full (judging from the number of cars in the parking lot) on Saturday but much less so on Sunday. I stayed in the king bed executive room, which was as described - it had a comfortable king-bed, a couch and coffee table, a sink,... More",1

"My best friend, her brother and I went to visit Washington D.C on September 2015 and this is where we stayed. The staff in this hotel was really friendly and helpful.

"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",0
"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.",0
Earlier review was for wrong hotel in a diff state but now the hotel stay isnt the best but my issue was getting a busy signal every time i tried to reach my fiance on the room phone so annoying but the hotel can use some new clean mattresses. Anyways the phone issue was my biggest problem.,1
"Stayed here a few years ago and liked it so much we decided to revisit again. It was just as good but quite a bit more expensive than before, probably due to the popularity of Santa Monica it being a weekend.",1
Our stay was perfect. The room was immaculate and location was great.The people at the front desk were so accommodating and helpful.We arrived early and they got us a room before check in time.They gave helpful restaurant choices as well!!Hey Dianne! We are happy you enjoyed your stay! Please come back and see us again! Cheers!,1
"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,",1
"Rooms clean, digital check-in upon arrival was less than 60 seconds. Worth the time saving and convenience. Room was clean ad set up conveniently for comfort. This was my second experience with digital check-in and found it convenient and easy",1
"The breakfast bar was wonderful, so many choices. The location was pretty good and they provide shuttle to Metro. The room was not great. The bathroom was clean, the beds were on the small side. The rest of the room seemed a bit outdated (but fine by me for the price). BIG DOWNFALL. Gum on two areas of the headboard. I do not know who puts gum on the top and side of the headboard, but I am more disturbed housekeeping did not see it to clean it up. Overall for the price compared to others it was pretty good.",1
Metro Points Hotel provides wonderful service for a very reasonable price. They even offer a convenient shuttle service to and from the nearest metro station at no extra charge. Every staff member was helpful and pleasant.,1
"Stopped in for evening on way north to Buffalo. This was our second Home2 booking of the year. Overall, I rate the hotel well. While I am not a fan of the uber sterile environment, I understand it's purpose. Suite was set with two queen beds and pull out couch. There was a hospital style curtail to separate rooms (red...

Bad: Non smoking hotel but people were smoking in casino and staff didn't talk to them. Good: Loved the bed linens...very comfy.,1
Gracious upscale lodging within a short walk from the downtown fun of Bend.

The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!,0
"Stayed one night to visit the Aquaruim before leaving the US. Great location, staff very helpful, rooms good size comfortable.",1
This is very pleasant hotel on the Sout side of town. Not far from the college but far enough away where it is quiet and peaceful. Right beside the loop. Good breakfast and nice rooms. A little older but remodeling has upgraded it.,1
"The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy.",0
"My friend's family reserved a section of rooms for their daughter's wedding. The hotel personnel were very helpful and friendly. Our rooms were used for preparing for the wedding, and the hotel was accommodating, from ensuring that room supplies were ample to helping us navigate around town. This hotel was clean and hospitable!!!",1
"I wanted to surpirse my boyfriend by not having to go home after picking him up from the airport and everything about the hotel was PERFECT. The location and hotel didn't feel like we were in Phoenix, and we live here!We're so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit again soon.",1
Staff was extremely accommodating and always pleasant!,1

"Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. I am pleased to hear that you and your daughter had a memorable and positive experience during your stay. Should your travels bring you back to Seattle, we hope to have another opportunity to serve you. Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature.",1
"This hotel has recently had a facelift. My daughter stayed here several years ago, and was very impressed with the update! Quiet, with super comfortable beds. Friendly staff and great breakfast. Easy off and on interstate. Near mall, other shopping district and restaurants. And the price is right!",1
Wonderful stay--- really enjoyed it.,1
Good: reasonable choice of breakfast items.,1
"This Hotel was wonderful. I booked this stay online which was simple to do, was checked in by a friendly staff.

I didn't get to use the pool... More",1
The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel.,0
"This place is very nice. However, for the room price, they still make you pay extra for wifi, which I found kinda silly. It's 12.95 for wifi per day. The room itself was in fantastic condition and very clean. No complaints there. Just on a personal note, I found the rooms and decor to be a bit 1960s looking. Kinda... More",1
I only stay 1 night. I found the hotel to be clean and quiet. The front desk folks were extremely friendly. Additionally there a couple fast food places walking distance. Continental breakfast wasn't bad. I would recommend this hotel.,1

The town itself is cute as can be and has several small cafes with outside seating and a couple of nicer restaurants for more formal dining.",1
We stayed in a room for 2 nights over Labor Day weekend. The place has a lot of character and it was a perfect place to spend time with my family.

"This hotel is a dream! I visit the hotel to get a break from home and family and to relax. I stay for two days, and don't even leave the hotel!! I love the rooms, the luxurious bedding, the big showers, the swimming pool, the fitness center. It's a wonderful hotel. Great value.",1
The staff was very professional and courteous. They provided excellent services like the shuttle and gave excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. They even gave me walking directions on how to get to the restaurants and even offered the shuttle. My room was clean.,1
Homeless people wandering the parking lot and lobby. Dirty carpets and smelly rooms with ripped bedding. Not impressed. Employees were nice enough and apologized for the homeless people who followed you in your car in the parking lot asking for money.,0
"This is the sixth time we've stayed here. Great rooms, excellent service, and a sweet breakfast with a make omelettes to order chef! Close to USAFA and lots of good stuff. Colleen is the bomb, and will give you wonderful personal service!",1
"When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees.",0
Easy to check in and readiness of room at arrival. Minimal vending available and breakfast was prepared packages of food for microwave heating ... not able to see product. Rooms adequate with somewhat sterile accommodations. Clearly hear other rooms on either side.,1
"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.",1

We chose this facility based on location and website and offerings. I was VERY disappointed and would not recommend. The suite was unclean with items in disrepair. Ordered a chilled champagne and flutes and had a warm bottle of champagne and dirty flutes upon arrival.,0

"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip.",1

"My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent.",1

I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there.,1

"We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed.",1

"A no frills location in a residential area. Close to freeways, 7/11, Starbucks and a Mexican restaurant/nightclub. Check in was quick and not welcoming but to the point.

"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future",1
"Mostly good, my credit card and drivers license was lost/stolen and two of your front desk people helped me out but wish you could have made it easier for me as I have stayed there every time I have flown out of Spokane for 14 years. . I was told my reservation was cancelled as I had blocked my credit... More",1
Very disappointed. Motel was clean but lacked amenities. I was charged 79 for a Friday night stay. They advertised 60 for double occupancy. Was told weekend rates were 10 higher Will not recommend this motel.,0
Very nice area. There was a great Italian restaurant with in walking distance.,1
"Room was huge, continental breakfast in the morning, good location close to airport, friendly staff - everything great, except the bed bugs. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker - woke up with about 30 bites on hands, legs neck. Hopefully you won't get the same room. If the bugs were gone, my quality value ratings would be high!",0
"We had very few +'s at this hotel and several minuses. On checking in we felt like staff was condescending and preoccupied with something other than us on their minds.

"Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there.",0
"Good: Everything , I travel the world since I was I child and I never see a hotel like zetta hotel, it's amazing.",1
"Stay at this hotel about 4 times per year. Always friendly staff, decent breakfast, comfortable mattress and clean. Easy to find right past Bandera exit off 1604 NW, San Antonio, Tx. Never have any problems. Very reliable quality of service.",1
Nothing Great bed and shower. All you need. Great help yourself continental breakfast and liked the drink and snacks in the evening. Fabtastic location,1

One of my favorite hotels in SF and one of the best options you have down near SOMA. Its near the Moscone Center and Yerba Buena Gardens.

I stay here often and will not stay any place else. Incredibly clean and superb staff. Hotel is in the heart of shopping and dinning.

You can't beat brand new. This hotel opened in October. It looked like it opened last week. The rooms all have kitchenettes. We appreciated the fridge and the microwave.

"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon.",1
Had issues with checkin in everyone was backed up there is two seperate hotels across a busy street from one another . Tbe hotel is in the hood . Key didnt work clean up lady was more help than the front desk staff. Get a name brand hotel maybe a few minutes further away from downtown than this place.,0
"Our hotel room was spotless. The staff were so helpful and caring. They helped us out with our car. It's rare to find people who will help a stranger. We stay here frequently since my daughter goes to Chapman University. It's not in the most picturesque location, but everything else about it is great.",1
I stayed at the Hyatt Place while visiting Atlanta for a conference at a nearby hotel.

"Very nice hotel, clean and cozy! Beds was very comfortable! We in joy to stay this place! Thank you",1
This was our first stay at this hotel though we generally stay at a Hampton Inn when travelling. This was by far the worst condition we've ever found a Hampton in. I believe a renovation and upgrade throughout the hotel would benefit this location greatly.,1
As I mentioned previously we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Red. This has probably been our 10th time we have selected Hotel Red for our Madison lodging. Hotel Red offers a unique boutique hotel experience versus the mundane chain hotels.,1
My daughter and I stayed here in February 2016 while we were visiting Duquesne University. It was right off campus and so conveniently located. I would highly recommend this location for a campus visit.,1
"This was a very nice hotel. Even' with its location near downtown, it was very nice and very clean. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone traveling to Lexington. The fitness center was great!!",1
Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.,1
"Hotel was very clean. Wonderful accommodations.the staff were very friendly and helpful. They made sure everything was in order. We were in the city for a funeral and the staff and hotel made things easier for us. I would stay at this hotel again, and again.",1
Basic room. Staff was nice and helpful. No lock on bathroom door. No hair dryer. Mini fridge in room clicked loudly and had to unplug to sleep. Denny's in parking lot which I originally counted as a plus attracted people leaving clubs at 2 am making the parking lot very noisy on Saturday night. AC worked well.,1
"The response from the desk was basically too bad, not our fault. So much for customer service!!!!",0
"The staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and breakfast was always good.",1
"Nothing particularly wrong with this hotel, but nothing stood out as great. Check-in/out was easy with friendly front desk staff. Hotel is located near the highway, so getting in and out was easy.

Only complaint was the room got very hot during the night because the thermostat was not working properly. Have stayed at this location before and did not have any problem with heating or cooling.,1
"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals.",0
The room was a lot nicer than I expected. The hotel staff at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. Clean good smelling rooms. Pretty pool.

"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.",1
Stay was perfect for a family reunion of sorts. We utilized the spacious lobby and found the staff to be more than accommodating! Thank you to all!,1
"Good experience with one exception. Room 123 is not good due to close proximity to exercise room, and should perhaps be considered as not a guest room. Each morning as people would exercise, perhaps at 5am, I awoke and could not return to sleep because the running on the machine was very loud.",1
Great hotel tucked back of the main road. Quite location though. But you still hear the airplanes flying into Memphis. Staff was helpful and pleasant to deal with. Room was clean and everything worked as it should. Reasonable rates for the area. I wish Best Western would improve their online registration process.,1
"Clean, comfortable and complimentary breakfast. Staff was very good and no surprises. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",1
"Our recent stay at Beltway Best Western was quite enjoyable. The facility was clean, comfortable and located close to major highways. The staff did an excellent job of providing for our needs and they were all very courteous and friendly. We would definitely consider staying at this facility in the future if we have to visit this area.",1
Bed was way to soft.,1
"I got a room on the 2nd floor and when I mentioned about having 2 kids, the front desk person immediately checked and provided a room allotted for handicapped people as it was available. Kudos to her (Couldn't get her name) and it made our stay more pleasant. I will certainly try this place again when I visit this region.",1
"It was very clean and nice. It was more expensive than I normally pay. (I am willing to sacrifice a good bit just to pay less but, my aunt wanted to stay there). The staff was friendly and helpful. You will like it.",1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived early and we're check-in with zero issues. The room was bigger than expected and clean. They even shuttled my friends and I around the area. We couldn't ask for a better stay.,1
"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley",1

I stayed 6 nights while on business. The hotel was clean with a very nice restaurant which is always a plus. The room service was also a nice perk after long days at work. The staff was friendly and offered to help in any way needed. I will stay here again!,1

"The two days I spent at your Best Western Inn near the Rochester airport, was great before and after my sons graduation ceremony from RIT college. The breakfast every morning was delicious and definitely worth getting up early for. I really enjoyed my stay at this location.",1
"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town.",1

Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night. Lots of road noise. The breakfast was good with lots of options and great service by the folks managing it.,1
"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!",0
We bought a boat in Mamaroneck and we needed a place to stay while we worked on it. We ended up staying 2 months ! Had two different kitchenette rooms both of them were good.

Check in was speedy. Everything was clean. Room was comfy. The breakfast was a little average but overall everything was fine.,1
"Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher. Furniture and decor were modern and well thought-out.",1

Which is awesome after a long day at work! Breakfast isn't too bad, enough to get you going, coffee is good so I can't complain, lol. There isn't anything in... More",1
Only positives are location and friendly staff. Hotel is a dump and they add a surprise 15 convenience charge on top of everything. You won't see any mention of this charge on your reservation. Lobby has been re-done and looks great but don't be fooled. Elevator area looks like war happened around it. I've seen freight elevators in better condition.... More,0
"This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union.

Bad: Charge more than booking. Good: Locations,1
For some reason according to the front desk the regular queen room booked from Hotels.com gave us a handicap room. I stayed at a wonderful Red Roof Inn in Boston a few years ago. Since then i have been to 2 in Pennsylvania. It is definitely not the same. Won't be staying at red roof again,0
"I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney",1
The man at the front desk was so nice and helpful! The hotel was clean and well taken care of,1

Good: The staff was very accommodating and the beds were very comfortable.,1
"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon.",1

"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",0
"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!",1

"Our stay at Rail Haven was fantastic from the time we checked-in. Upon arrival we were met by a smiling face Adam. He was more than helpful with directions and advice. All other staff members were courteous and polite. The hotel is very well kept, quiet, and is a hidden gem. The outdoor sitting area is a nice relaxing place... More",1
We had a great time!,1
"I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel is very clean, modern, odor and scent-free and well-decorated. The room was well-appointed. The shower was a bit weak. The heater was quiet. The exercise room was merely adequate but very clean. Valet parking is 18 daily.",1
"Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!",0
"We stay in this hotel every year when we visit Columbus for ballgames. We find the employees at this hotel are very friendly, accommodating, and always ready to make casual conversation!....The rooms are attractive, clean and comfortable. The noise level is not bad at all. There are restaurants and shopping ares close to this hotel, but the larger restaurants and... More",1
That was the best most comfortable hotel stay I've ever had. Good breakfast and very friendly staff. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to VA Beach.,1
"The Inn at Virginia Tech is a well run hotel by the University. The atmosphere is nice and the grounds well kept. It is great for a conference but at times can be a little isolated from town. Blacksburg is a great place to visit, so if you are at the Inn, be sure to go into town and experience... More",1
"I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again.",0
"Our stay was ok-if the bathroom sink had drained and they had mattresses that didn't sink real bad, the place would be great for the money.",1

"After reading a few less than stellar reviews, my husband and I were skeptical when we arrived (2 hours early) to this Hampton Inn. It is an older building and many newer hotels are in the area. The staff welcomed us, found us a clean room that was available very early in the day, the room was perfectly clean, beds... More",1
I enjoyed it. Breakfast is great although you did not have oatmeal that morning which I always love so that was not pleasant for me for breakfast. Please always have oatmeal.,1
"20 Extra charge for King bed, 10 charge for a microwave in the room, but couldn't put it in because maintenance wasn't on site. The room was decent and clean. The staff was friendly enough. Another guest with body odor permeated the lobby with her essence and it was quickly addressed. Location is very convenient and the price was reasonable. We missed breakfast, so I cannot provide feedback on that.",1
we were assigned a room that had a partially disrobed male guest allready occupying the room when we opened the door. we were then assigned a different room that had industrial noise from outside off and on thru-out the night.this was not the peaceful/restful night we expected.,1

"ONLY HAS VALET PARKING WHICH IS A PAIN AS ON 1 TIME THEY HAD A LOT IS FULL SIGN OUT FRONT, SO HAD TO PARK IN A PUBLIC LOT 2 BLOCKS AWAY. ALSO 1 DAY WE DID NOT GET OUR NEWSPAPER--THEY RAN OUT AND TOLD ME I COULD WALK 3 BLOCKS AND BUY ONE. MY WIFE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE, IT NEVER CAME SO SHE CALLED AND IT WAS READY, NO ONE HAD BOTHERED TO BRING IT UP. THE FIRST DAY, HAD TO GET MAINTENANCE TO ROOM TO SHOW ME HOW TO TURN ON LIVING ROOM LIGHTS. ALL SORTS OR TRICKS NEEDED. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE ROOM WAS CLEAN , SUPER BED TO SLEEP IN AND THE STAFF WAS REALLY NICE AND FRIENDLY.",1
"We were in area for a memorial service, so room booked on short notice. This Hampton was at a good location with shopping close by,also near major highways but yet secluded. We found the staff pleasant helpful, hotel was updated and rooms were clean nice but average size. Breakfast at this hotel was exceptional for motels/hotels.",1
"We've stayed here a few times and love it. The location can't be beat, it's within easy walking distance of down town. Many good restaurants nearby. The staff is super, the hotel is clean and well managed. The lobby is always lively, lots going on, a very up-beat place. Nice bar in the lobby where you can also get snacks.",1
"Good, quiet location. Away from the shops but still in the heart of it all. Within walking distance of everything including Grand Canyon railway. The usual noise from neighbors -- running water, doors closing and mumbled voices through the walls. I'd stay here again.",1
"Good: Wonderful, friendly staff and incredible location. Loved the happy hour and breakfast on each floor. Couldn't have done better for a first trip to Chicago.",1
"We had an amazing time. The hotel was a perfect place for us. And, every staff person we came in contact with was outstanding! We plan on going back.",1
We stayed here for my boyfriends birthday. The staff was friendly and the stay was great. There was a two person tub in the bathroom and the room was a decent size.We had room service and the food was good. I will definitely go back.,1
"Very nice hotel. Staff is courteous and helpful. Hot tub was great. Very clean room and lobby. Decent breakfast... Loved the pancake making machine. I want one! Push one button, then 2 minutes later out pops a fresh hot pancake.",1
"In town for a funeral. The hotel was okay. Heat/AC was noisy. Wires across floor in common area a trip hazard. Employees were pleasant. The room was a little suite, but was oddly set up. Some of the furniture was too big for the room, almost totally blocking the small closet. But overall no major complaints.",1
Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub. Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry.,0
"Our room was spacious enough for 4. Even with our very late arrival, the front desk person was friendly and gave us a good room. The breakfast was the best so far on the trip, with cold and hot options, like scrambled eggs and sausage. A nice find along the way.",1
We had 5 rooms and all were clean and well maintained. Everything worked and the area was quiet at night. I would stay here again if in the area. A good basic room at a good price and the management was very helpful.,1
"I really enjoyed myself. Great atmosphere, the food was delicious. Bar tender was on point. The patio was so relaxing. I'm planning my get away weekend there. Over all 10. The Soldan's committee couldn't found a better place to have our reunion. Plenty of space. The workers were very helpful. Clean atmosphere.",1
Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant. The shuttle experience was the worst I ever experienced! Driver (the one who walks with a limp) never greeted anyone was never on time.,1

Although we had to wait a half hour til our room was ready, they made sure we were comfortable and gave us bottled water. The room was GREAT. A huge bathtub was a delight. I don't normally take a bath... More",1
Overnight stay to visit family,1
"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast.",1
Bad: No casino. Good: All of it,1
"Home2 Suites is a new hotel with modern decor. The room was nice with a small kitchen, table and desk and couch. The only drawback of the room was the bed was placed right next to the air conditioning unit, which is quite loud when your head is right next to it. The room was a good size.",1
My only big criticism is that the shower felt a little uncomfortable. I couldn't adjust the head so that it moved in different directions. But the staff--particularly Erica at the front desk--was excellent and very considerate.,1
Very Nice Hotel. Great location for CCL guest to stay. Stay away from building number 4.Thanks for the great comments and glad you liked it. Building four can get loud as it is next to the pool area though many guests love it just for that reason. Hope to see you soon!,1
"After paying $150-160 dollars for one night I was totally disappointed that there was no free breakfast or free WiFi and on top of that you had to pay $16 a night to park, totally outrageous!  I have had all of the above plus free parking at cheaper but nice hotels.",1

Also need a direct phone line from the airport to hotel for shuttle service like other hotels and services. If I hadn't brought along the phone number, I would have been stuck. Wish there were other restaurants nearby. Also need a better selection of drinks for managers reception--I have stayed at many other Em. Suites and have had a much better selection--also bartenders were a little surly and the place wasn't really that crowded. Snacks catered to Vegans. Front desk personnel were extremely helpful--above and beyond the call of duty.",1
One of my best Marriott experiences has been at this hotel. I loved the way in which I was treated from the very beginning to the end. Heather is the best front desk attendant.

Nice hotel/ great location,1
I've stayed at this hotel several times and this was the BEST stay that we've EVER had here. It has been so cleaned up and is now very comfortable.,1
"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable.",0
"Easy access from I5 for an overnight stay in the way further south. Front staff was very friendly and helpful. The evening reception offer is also a very nice touch.

"The overall building is clean but showing some signs of wear...The front desk staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay.",1
"It was a nice clean hotel, they give a free shuttle to the metro station. But on weekends the parking in the metro station is free so you can very well drive ur own car and park there. Breakfast was good too.",1
"Bad: Possibly lower parking rates,.",1
"This isn't a high end property by any means, but it is clean, reasonably priced, and a short drive to local attractions. It's right off highway 5, so it's easy to get off and back onto freeway. Parking is a standard open lot, no fee. The main negative is they have the window like air conditioner units that are noisy... More",1
Business require that we be in Norfolk early in the morning. Rather than fight the traffic from our home to Norfolk early in the morning we opted to stay in La Quinta. It was only 10 minutes from our appointment. The desk attendent was very helpful with direction. we arrived at our meeting rested and relaxed. If the opportunity arose for us to make an early morning visit again we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. We were well pleased and could recomend it to anyone.,1

"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after.

"I expected much less for what I paid, but this place was great. Staff was excellent, good breakfast, able to get my laundry done cheaply, great rom and a great place. This will be first choice next time I'm in this area again.",1
"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel. Solely for leisure, I will not return to US again. Not value for money. Good: It was one of the cheapest places we found in Las Vegas during those days.",1
"Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price.",1
Looking forward too returning again. Hopefully sooner rather than later.,1

"Booked the hotel during July 4th weekend because it was relatively close to Sea World. Paid double the normal rate because of the holiday weekend as usual. Just needed a place to stay the night and was cheaper than surrounding hotels. Room was clean, staff was friendly at check in. No complaints and would stay again in the future.",1
Enjoyed my whole stay! The only complaint I have is that they did not keep toiletries stocked as well as they did in the past when I have stayed! I love the indoor and outdoor pool and the staff members were all friendly!,1
Very nice place to stay when in Asheboro. Staff is super friendly. Rooms are what you would expect for a Fairfield and clean. Free breakfast is actually quite nice with plenty of options. I would certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers.,1
"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!",0

Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.",1
not bad at all. no complaints,1
Hotel in good location. Right off interstate and close to many restaurants and shopping areas. Hotel provided list of restaurants near the hotel. Clean and quiet hotel. Good parking. Nice breakfast and wi- fi was good. Did not have any problems. Would stay here again.,1
"The Emerald Isle is very nice for an Up North accomodation. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and spacious, with a kitchenette in each. We weren't expecting a 5-star resort. Bill was gracious and accomodating. Yes, there were some things that didn't work, as others have said. After experiencing life on Beaver Island, you understand some of the unique challenges of renovations... More",1
"We recently spent one night at the Best Western in Lake Placid. It is conveniently located near the center of town, across from the skating arena. The facility is adequate, and offers a complementary breakfast. The parking is very difficult and it is not easy to get an SUV out of the parking lot area.",1
"We came to visit our newborn grand daughter and wanted a place to stay on the beach. This is a refurbished hotel, looks like they were going for an Ikea look and it is really ok. Not bad not great- just ok. The parking was kind of an issue, but we did work it out. It is on the beach... More",1
"Hubby and I stayed 2 nights at this particular location.It was wonderful.We splurged and got a suite and it was so nice.Full size couch and a chair with a couple of nice reading lamps and a tv that is better than the one we have at home in one room.The bedroom also had the same type of tv,great reception and...

This hotel was an excellent pick for the convenience and location that it was in. We stayed in the King City-view w/whirlpool and for the price it was worth every penny. What i didn't know was that the Braves had a game that weekend and the hotel was sold out...That didn't matter. The staff made us feel like we were... More,1

Not great,0
"We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy.",0
Weather was cold but we enjoyed the visit. I resent being forced to do this to enable your marketing. 50 words Minimum indeed!,1
"Beautiful hotel. For 109 you expect an average hotel but this is awesome. Automatic blinds, lights, huge bathroom. Nice standing shower with jacuzzi. Great cleaning staff, front desk, room service. Grilled chicken sandwich was the best ever. Mini bar prices are not too bad, fiji water was more expensive than liquor. 9.50 for a bottle of fiji water but 6... More",1
Bad: There is handicap parking for checking in but not close after checking in. Good: Everything was convenient and costs of the buffet were not bad. Prices in the restaurant were affordable.,1
"I stayed here for a business meeting being held in a nearby (and much more expensive) hotel. The staff were very nice helpful, the hotel is clean and was recently updated. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the fitness center well maintained and clean. There is a small bar in the lobby with reasonably-priced drinks but there is no... More",1

They have an indoor pool, indoor spa jacuzzi and a patio to dry off on or cook out on in the evening! The all inclusive breakfast is expansive compared to others. Love this... More",1
"I have worked at Disney for the last 8 years, so I am very hard to please. We did not have a lot of money to spend on this trip. I was very reluctant to stay in a cheap hotel. To my surprise this hotel was clean, comfortable, the breakfast was great. I will stay at this hotel again. I was pleasantly surprised.",1
"Renovated room was very nice. My request regarding a room on the first floor and close to where I would unload... handicap if possible... was met in all respects. Breakfast was hot and fresh, with all the usual items! Personnel were friendly and helpful:-)",1
"60's Era building, but updated with microwave, hair dryer etc. No elevator for the second floor.",0
"I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms.",1
"Best breakfast I have had at any hotel - marvelous fresh berries and navel oranges. Spacious walk in showers. Clean, large modern rooms and delightful management and staff. Attractive restaurant with an interesting selection of good food..Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate you choosing to stay with us and the opportunity to serve you.",1
we were on our way home and had a long day on the road and decided to stay in butte rather than go on to Bozeman. this hotel is a little out of the way and a little tricky to get to even though you can plainly see it from the highway. the room dcor was more than a bit... More,1
Bad: leave your car at home. parking cost is outrageous.,1
"Everything was great. Beds a little stiff, something slightly softer would have been great. No bacon at breakfast, bacon at breakfast would be an improvement also. Everyone was very nice and the value was good.",1
"This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet. I guess it's because of the pets allowed it's also easier to clean. Overall, this motel is an excellent option in Escalante, and don't miss the attached restaurant (Circle D eatery), which is very good.",1
I seemed like the Hotel is under going renovations. The road in front of the property is under going serious construction. One of the exterior doors to the Hotel never did not open from the outside. The air conditioner in the room was so noisy I did no sleep well the first few nights. The first day the maids failed to clean the room. We had to go to the front desk to get clean towels.,1
Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.,1
"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
First clean comfortable and quiet rooms. Great view from the rooms that are bayside (ask for it) but breakfast area has same great view. Great full breakfast (free). Staff treats you like they are glad you are there and glad they work there . Several really good restaurants are less than .4 miles and .easy walk,1
"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!",1
"I travel a lot for business and picked this hotel to try out and the price was right.Had clean rooms ,most important was the high speed wifi and it worked great. The staff was friendly and helpful.Planning to come back for vacation with family.I highly recommend this place for your trip.",1
"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included",1
Bad: No breakfast option and it was pricy to park every day. But nothing major. Good: Very modern and trendy property with very clean and spacious rooms at the heart of San Francisco. We had fun in the games room and enjoyed a drink at the bar after a long day of walking,1
"Called Labor Day 2015 (we stayed part of the weekend) to locate a couple lost bathing suits and Scott called me back Tuesday, located the suits, dried them out before sending them to me. He made several calls in that time frame to verify the items and really went the extra mile. Thank you!",1
Bad: Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to check in not enough staff to help. Room was not ready for an hour after check in.,1
My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel - incidentally I am a Gold HHilton Honors member. The staff did not bother to make up the room at all after the first night. We were very surprised when we brought visitors to our room after dinner to find the bed not made and the bathroom as we had... More,0
Needed a quiet place to spend the night during a cross country trip. This was in a quiet location and there was no noise heard from adjoining rooms. Wifi worked well and I got a good nights sleep. This is all I look for in a hotel. Would stay there again.,1
Bad: None. Good: My overall experience was great!,1
"It may look a bit dated as seen from the road and most of the the rooms we have stayed in are on the small side, but the utilization of space and attention to detail is amazing. Breakfast is the basic typical fare, very relaxed in the bright cheerful lobby area.",1
Bad: A bit expensive. Rooms do not have proper sunlight. Good: Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was not good but it was free. Staff was very helpful. Location is great.,1
"Decor was nice, and room was comfortable enough. Felt there was poor temperature control/ air circulation was poor, even with room fan on it felt too warm. Location in proximity to harbor was very convenient, with everything within walking distance.",1
We recently spent 4 nights at this hotel. We originally booked for 2 nights but were so impressed by the hotel ambience that we stayed an extra 2. From the moment we checked in we found the staff to be warm and welcoming. The hotel is within walking distance of the Alamo and Riverwalk but the hotel also offers an... More,1
Stayed here as part of a bigger American adveture with my new husband! The hotel was very centrally located and very close to all the tres fancy shops and beach!

I would advice not to go for this hotel. The staff is higly rude and they will over charge u. Very un proffessional behaviour will keep u waited un ncessary.,0
"The Coconut Waikiki Hotel was a great hotel. We definitely enjoyed our stay here.

The location itself was excellent, it was close to... More",1
"We stayed for one night after coming to and leaving from Alaska. Although they claim to have non smoking rooms, some of their rooms have been used for smoking before.

"We stayed in a studio, 815 and absolutely loved it The suite is immaculate with all the necessities, including towels, dish towels, beach towels and a full equipped kitchen. The lanai is gorgeous with breathtaking views of the ocean and the whales jumping. The grounds are very well manicured and the beach is fun to swim in and attempt to... More",1
The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned.,0
"We've been cycling across the U.S. since mid-June and have stayed at many hotels along the way. It's sometimes difficult to get personal attention at a chain hotel, but that's exactly what we found at this Comfort Inn. We were warmly welcomed and offered cold water while we checked in. Our room was nice and cool and spotlessly clean. We... More",1

"Very friendly staff. Decent clean room and bed, Slept well on motel was quiet Close to interstate, restaurants and shopping. Breakfast was a mediocre continental. A very reasonable price. Overall this was a good value",1
I was blown away by the lobby and halls. Our room was less than spectacular as it was a hotel tonight booking and probably was the last room in the building overlooking an alley. Even so the small room we had was well worth the money and did the trick.,1
"Bad: Need something horizontal in bathroom. . Good: Great accommodations, central location, great food.",1
"Our 1 bedroom suite was just right for my husband, daughter and me. We had enough space to spread out. We stay at Candlewood whenever we are visiting family in NJ. We like the kitchen with the full size refrigerator and microwave, dishwasher and two burner stove. We like the free laundry but it is not a place to go... More",1
"We booked this hotel not really knowing what to expect with all the mixed reviews. We were pleasantly surprised. We booked the Jnr Suite with two queen beds and a kitchenette in the middle. Small toiletries items are provided, but you'll need to provide your own dish soap. The room is very large and you don't feel like you are... More",1
"We were very pleased with this place. Helpful staff, big, clean, comfortable suite. 2BR suite was perfect for 2 adults 2 kids. (No breakfast, but it was a pleasant stroll to both Carl's Starbucks - can't complain!) Great deal for the - would definitely stay here again.",1
Good: Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item I had left in the room. The room had already been cleaned and the staff got the item back to me as quickly as possible. Roof top bar was beautiful.,1
"Problems with room , brand new Hotel paint peeling, tile broken in shower, room flooded.",1
"Nice hotel, a little way off the interstate, so it isn't loud. Pool was closed - I don't know why - disappointing after a hot day on the motorcycles. Not the cheapest choice, but a newer, comfortable, clean hotel, so a good value.",1
"We booked this hotel for our trip in September 2014 and we couldn't be more satisfied. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk was very friendly and welcoming. Our room was nice and very well-kept.

"Things I've come to expect from IHG/Holiday Inn - courteous front desk staff, okay rooms, adequate facilities. It was a stay for a work conference but did have a chance to check out the pool area and gym. The gym was quite small (2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 bike, yoga mat, exercise ball and free weights) but that is all... More",1
"The hotel room was decent and cute and clean! A non smoking floor as well which was nice since we had a baby with us or we would not have stayed there' We were passing through and chose the BW!The neighbourhood was sketchy as hell and we didn't feel like safest! When we got into the elevator-it sure smelt like someone just smoked a joint in there! ( not the hotels fault) Breakfast was ok, small room and super hot!bug a Nice lady working in there and helping out though! We slept well and had no issues",1
"I believe in the saying you get what you pay for. So, when I came across this hotel (being on a tight budget due to a unplanned 10 hr trip from TX) I booked it and hoped for the best. It was about 30 cheaper then the hotels around it. Although it had great reviews I was skeptical because of... More",1
"We stayed for 11 nights and this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We had a king suite with separate bedroom and it was contemporary, comfortable and well-appointed.

"Good hotel, great location, but needs a few improvements. No porter service, despite a somewhat awkward parking/luggage unloading situation that makes checking in/out difficult for handicapped/elderly. Similarly, no parking valet despite awkward parking situation. No dedicated concierge although desk staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The included breakfast buffet was nice in appearance, but very poor in quality.",1
"Loved the location - was able to walk to everything in the historical area.  Hotel was very well maintained.  Staff was friendly.  Had some issues with valet but other than that, loved the hotel.",1
"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
Quit and comfortable room. Bathroom could have been a little cleaner but was OK Nice breakfast,1
"Bad: bad sound insulation, housekeeping sucks, the new stuff that we bought got throw away... yogurt been spill on the floor. Good: the beds are very comfortable",0
"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar.",1
My girlfriend and I liked our room. It was very clean and perfect size for just the two of us. The only thing we were disappointed about was the location of the room itself. We booked the room thinking that it had a view of the creek. We were really wanting to see and hear it from our room. The title of creek side was very misleading. One other issue we had was that we weren't given the information to use the wifi.,1
"I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor. Upon waking up, I found a bed bug on the curtain. After calling the front desk, I was told that finding a bed bug was absolutely impossible. Donna, at the front desk, said she'd be right up. After waiting 10 minutes, I called back down to see when she anticipated coming... More",0
"The staff was courteous and attentive to us The room was nice, had a privacy wall and was big enough for a family of four.",1
Good: breakfast in room!,1
Bad: I wish breakfast was included in the price. Good: Everything!! Especially the fitness center.,1
"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.",1
"Was clean, comfortable and close to the hospital. I could not share in breakfast so a discount for us would have made us happier with the cost.",1
"VERY clean, comfortable place to stay located near downtown Napa. The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else. But you'll probably have to pay more.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"Decent , Hotel needs to be updated.",1

Loved the location. Within walking distance of all we wanted to do.,1
We drove down with no reservation on sat. Dec. 31st to bring in the new year. It's located within eye sight of tropicana and was the cheapest out of all in the area. The staff showed me the room before I rented it and had a safe location to park my car. It was great we had the deck above... More,1

The food at the Aqua restaurant was WAY over priced. 50.00 for 3 people for a buffet breakfast,1
Bad: Not enough supplies. Good: Everything,1
"Bad: The room smelled of spoiled food and there was hair from a drain left in the toilet when I arrived. Also mold on the grout in the shower. I would have asked to change rooms, but I was in a hurry to get to an appointment. Good: Location and exceptional staff. Especially the front desk and valet staff.",1
"Fantastic - ease of travel convenience, location with respect to attending events (easy access to Metro), great bar at the hotel. I cannot think of a single negative and will stay there anytime I travel to D.C.",1
"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!",0
This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready!

"We enjoyed our stay, the staff was friendly and helpful with info about where we were visiting. We had dinner at the Envoy which was delish and then drinks in the lounge. We will be sure to return on our next visit to the city!",1
Bad: Even though we got a non smoking room it still smelled like smoke. Good: Valet parking Duncan doughnut,1
"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!",1
This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!,1
"I picked this place because the parking was free, big mistake. I do not have anything against this nice place but I believe that i won't stay there again. The rooms are clean, the parking is big, there are many different stores and places where to buy anything around, but is also located in a violent area. It was a great stay that I won't repeat.",1
"Bad: Parking was expensive at 62 for 1 night, and o thought it was included but it wasn't. Good: Location was near sightseeing.",1
"Great experience all in all! Perfect for what I needed. Would stay again if staying in Columbia, MD area!!!!!!",1
"The Good: This Hampton Inn really stood out from the other Hampton Inns I've stayed at in recent weeks. The bed and room was really clean, well maintained, and very comfortable. The staff was really friendly and helpful. And the breakfast was better than usual every morning. Not sure what is different in the ingredients at some Hampton Inns. Even... More",1
"1. The Room Carpets were OLD, worn, very WORN and STAINED. 2. The lead clerk at the desk during check in was rude, abject Rude in her attempts to be prim and proper. 3. The clerk at the desk during check out was outwardly rude, abjectly Rude. She made my wife and I go back and forth between the hotel and the restaurant. We absolutely should not have been involved in that, at all. attempts to be prim and proper",1
"While the place is certainly interestingly decorated, and very quiet during the off season, there are very few amenities, at least of the sort we were interested in. No pool, no hot tub, no gym, but you can get a bucket of mid-level wine sitting on your bed when you arrive. Second floor has nice balconies overlooking the water.",1
I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really didn't have any idea where to stay. Aria looked new and fresh and the package deal with airfare was pretty compelling.

I like Hampton Inns and this was a pretty good one. We stopped on the way to the Outer Banks. Room was comfortable. We stayed on the fifth floor and didn't hear any noise from outside.

Perfect to explore the downtown area on foot, many attractions within walking distance or the free shuttle will take you.The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.

"Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's. I have passed on your comments to our housekeeping department as we all know that providing a clean room is essential and it is something we all take great pride in.When you are next in Chicago, we would be delighted to look after you again.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager",1
"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.",0
"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back",1
"Hotel was in reasonable conditio. We were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice, reasonable clean and confortable and located near a Metro Station. The neighborhood was questionable, though we had no problems, I wouldn't recommend going out at night. Breakfast was limited, but plenty of food.",1
"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1

"Stayed at two different hotels in seattle. The maxwell is a gret location for the space needle, seattle center, science center, sculpture garden, etc. another huge benefit was the free parking- which is rare in seattle.

"We booked the 4 bedroom suite and were happy with the size and space we had for 9 of us.

"Well, on a whole the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off on both sides of our bed. The TV was very good, it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate. The room was 122 and I could hear the traffic (hubby sleeps with ear plugs), I had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise. WiFi was great. Breakfast, we grabbed a couple bananas, coffee and left as it was really sparse.",1

"Great hotel across street from metro, nice pool and sauna. Great ritz service.",1
"The location was right off the highway which was perfect. The hotel is outdated, but the rooms were clean and functional. Everyone working here was very happy and helpful. It also had a decent breakfast. All in all I thought it was a great value and would stay here again..",1
"While nice looking on the outside and in the lobby the rooms leave much to be desired! Upon checking in we spent the next 15 minutes chasing and squishing black bugs around the floor. The mattress is very old and worn down, quite lumpy with the edges collapsing.",0

"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night",1
"Stayed here July 22-25, 2016. The front desk people were true gems, very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and wifi was free. All guest rooms have a refrigerator and a microwave.

"When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service.",0
When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again.,0

Great facility and top-notch service at half the price of the comparable hotels across the Potomac. Easy access to DC via the Metro stop beneath the hotel.,1
Our first family reunion in Atl I was very happy with staff professionalism and friendliness to help with suggests. One family had a room problem and it was handled in a timely matter. I would recommend this hotel,1
"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",1
"Nice, clean, beautiful and everybody was very helpful and they provided the best customer service!!!",1
"Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location.",1
Very nice hotel. The lobby was very modern and the staff were accommodating. The pool room and back patio were very nice. Would have liked a hot tub but none was available. The breakfast was warm and had a good variety. I liked having the access to the wifi and many places around the hotel to recharge my devices.,1
"The Hotel was beautiful, staff very nice, and clean rooms. However, we got really lost going into the city and the front desk person was not from the area and could not help us at all with directions. The other was that we got a not request 6 a.m. wake up call that scared the two of us, we thought it was an emergency and bolted up across the room to find out it was a mistake.",1
"My Place hotels may not be your Top of the Line Hotels, but neither is the cost. This is a nice, clean and comfortable hotel for a price that is affordable.

We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff the shuttle service was fantastic!

"Wasn't too thrilled that I had to hike up three flights of stairs to get to my room since none of the elevator were working, but then I found out from some other guests that were sitting out in the first floor hallway that the downstairs had horrible internet service, so being on an upper floor turned out to have its advantages. No complaints regarding the room, amenities, or free breakfast.",1

Thanks for daily breakfast. Great hospitality staff. Clean. Quiet. Easy access to restaurants and freeway.,1
"Got off to a rocky start as the room was not ready at our check in time, guaranteed late check in. This was at 10pm on a Sunday night! The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed.",1

"I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff. Free bottled water stations on each floor are also a nice touch.I will stay here again if I'm traveling alone.",1
"superb hotel. Can't go wrong with location, comfort or worth the money you spend for it. With breakfast buffet and afternoon reception you can't go wrong with meeting everyones wants. the rooms are comfortable and quiet. We were by the elevator and couldn't not here the elevator and traffic coming or going. Free transportation to local restuarants, metro and airport was just another bonus. All hotel personnel were top notch ..very friendly, helpful and efficient. Couldn't be happier with our trip and accommodations.",1
I cannot say enough about this beautiful bed and breakfast! It was such a pleasant first experience!

"I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday.",0

"The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there.",0

The property is lovely and Sarah was able to give me a quick tour not only of the London but pointing out many things to do in her city. You can tell she... More,1
Everything went very well. We requested early arrival and a first floor room. All requests were met. Personnel were friendly and most helpful.,1
"Stopped here after my son's Doctor visit at Geisinger. Very relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere, excellent service and the food was exceptional.",1
"With all the other choices in the area, I'll stay somewhere else next time. This is the 1st Embasy Suites I won't stay at again. It doesn't appear that they care about the upkeep of the hotel and as a non-smoker, I wasn't impressed with the smoke everywhere! I DID receive the non-smoking room I reserved...Too bad it wasn't smoke-free...because the room REEKED!!",1
"Both the pool and the tiki bar were not open during our stay, which was a huge disappointment. The bathtubs were not very clean either. Location is very convenient as you can save parking fees by walking to Kings Dominion.",1
"Free room on BW points, regular stopping hotel on trips tpo SW Missouri. I find Best Westerns the best value for the price and always use them if available for both business and personal travel. I have never had a bad experience in any Best Western in 23 years and a business traveler.",1
"Stayed here for a last minute trip. Was able to get into 2 bedroom suite due to a cancellation. Right in the heart of downtown, walk to everything. The room was very clean, lots of space the most comfortable bed/linens. I could see myself living in it! The host was accommodating and made us feel welcome. Would absolutely return... More",1
"We had a 2 night stay. The room was immaculate and comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding, many choices and home cooked options that were delicious. The staff were helpful and took pride in their place. Would definitely stay here again...great location, too. A great find.",1
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages. I fell and fractured my hand on the last day of our stay (off property) and the... More",1
We stayed at the Comfort Inn Ballston at the end of March 2016 and we chose this particular hotel because it was within walking distance of the metro and had free parking. We stayed for 2 nights and would absolutely stay there again. Our room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. I really cant say much negative about our... More,1
Bad: A lot of the staff had a don't ask me its not my job attitude. At the check in desk personal phone calls had guest waiting 3 to 4 minutes before even responded to. Good: The building was beautiful it quick walk to the waterfront. The valets were great and not only did they hold our bags but the car until we were ready to pick them up later that night,1
"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)",1
After a long journey across town we turned up all hot and bothered but when we walked into the hotel lobby we were greeted with a warm smile and welcome. The hotel has free Wifi and parking which we found with all of the budget type hotels in the US. Breakfast was included and kids under 12 eat free. We... More,1
"Very clean, attractive hotel with easy access to the freeway. The rooms were spacious, attractive and well equipped. Standard breakfast for the Comfort Inn chain. There were no USA Today papers available. A wide variety of restaurants within walking distance.",1
They had their shuttle pick me up at the airport. My room was clean and quiet. Overall a pleasant stay. Staff was very friendly.,1

"My wife and I decided to try it because of the previous three reviews, they were new to Expedia and it was a great price for room. We like to get away on weekends a few times a month and on weekends when our inconsiderate neighbors play loud music. This time we didn't have a ton of money so we... More",1
"The hotel is very confortable, besides breakfast they offer wine tasting in the afternoons. The price is a bit expensive and the hotel stay a bit far from downtown Napa, so a car is required. Parking is free, which is a plus.",1
"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing",0
"I paid extra for a city view and what I got was a disappointing, ugly building right across the street. The extra money spent on having a city view was not worth it. It seemed clean. Nice room.",1
Bad: The ventilation system was not adequate for the building. Everything including room smelled like cigarette smoke. Good: restaurant,1
"After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable.",0
"My first night, my room was ok, but the AC fan or housing made a racket. I actually removed the plastic covering because it was broken and I thought that's what was rattling...wrong. I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well.",1
Would stay there again.,1
You get what you pay for. The staff was terrific. The rooms need updating. Carpet was a bit worn. The breakfast was so so. Overall the place was clean and a bargain for the price. We would stay there again if in the area.,1
"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.",0

Our house in currently under construction and my family and I selected the Homewood Suites in North Austin as a safe haven during the madness.

"Upon arrival, we were welcomed courteously. The receptionist gave us a corner room with a convertible sofa bed. The extra space gave us plenty of room to place all the things needed for the wedding.

The security staff were always present near the front door and very welcoming",1
I stay in at least one Hampton inn per week. Usually they are all the same which is what you would expect and average. This Hampton does a few things different and better! Mini sandwiches and snacks were available at check in gratis nice touch for sure. At breakfast it wasn't the same scrambled eggs they heat up from a... More,1
"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.",0
Good: Excellent location and great continental breakfast,1
Perfect location.  Friendly helpful staff.  Great gym.  Loved the Christmas music and decorations.  Beautiful courtyard.  Fire pits by the pool.  Complimentary coffee in the morning.,1

Great hotel for the price. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location to main highways. Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.,1
"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"I was surprised by my room. I didn't expect it to be so large and in such good condition. We had lots of space and the room was clean. The internet was slower, but it worked. The hall ways are in dire need of a carpet cleaning and the piles of trash at the dumpsters had us prepared for a... More",1
Bad: the value of the motel is not much with what you charged us.,0
We booked our room through expedia and it lists cribs as available. When we checked in however we were told they don't have cribs. Super disappointing when traveling with a 1 year old.,1
"What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!",1
"We always have a positive experience at Saratoga Springs. The Congress Park section of the resort is within easy walking distance of Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) and even closer now with a new pedestrian bridge. Additionally, there is a little used entrance off Buena Vista drive that makes for easy in/out near hotel row.",1
"We pulled in for the night on a long trip. Bed was good! Towels a touch rough. The road noise was loud! We have a 'wind machine' on our phone, so we managed, but lots of trucks, lots of traffic. Would ask for the back side if we stayed here again. Very clean and very pleasant front desk.",1
Me and my husband decided to get away for a weekend and found this hotel online. It had everything we needed plus a mini-fridge and an lcd tv. The room was clean and comfortable. A very delightful stay. :),1
We only stayed in the hotel one night during a quick trip to Columbus recently. The beds were pretty awful making it very difficult to get a good night sleep. The walls are also VERY thin! We continuously heard our neighbors late into the night laughing and talking. At one point we did call the front desk clerk who was... More,1
"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!",1
"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life",1
"The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home.",0
We liked our room. There were sheets for the pull out couch and everything was clean. We would appreciate another bathroom next time when traveling with two small children. The pool was fun and we got an hour late check out time easily.The pool was fun and pretty clean.,1
"This motel has been updated to some extent, the floors squick badly, the shower needs a lot of TLC, the walls must be very thin, as you can hear the TV next door. On the bright side, the beds are comfortable, the room is clean, and all the rooms on the main floor have a private patio. I has a... More",1
"Good: Good location, comfortable bed",1
"Great space and the bed was heavenly. The only critiques I had were the fact that I had to pay 15 for wifi and there was no room service, both of which surprised me about a hotel at this price point.",1
"We were here for a three-day dance convention. We travel a lot, and this hotel was very excellent. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the service in the restaurant was lacking. When I went for dinner, I had to pour my own glass of water and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to finally come to my table. Otherwise, the hotel was great.",1
With my daughter at UCSB it seems I have tried everything from VRBO to El Capitan tents in the Santa Barbara area! This hotel was a pleasant surprise even though it is tucked away in a residential area a few miles from the beach. I love when hotels provide the little extras when you get to your room. My room...

We had a standard room with a minor view of the strip. The room was perfect. Temperature just right and clean as a whistle and fully atuomated.

"Great hotel, restaurant and bar. Close to my work destination.",1
The hotel was great and just a block away from Discovery Kingdom. They have a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the park and picks you up later. This will save you 25 a day in parking. The breakfast buffet was a great way to start your day. They have coffee and cold water for you at the lobby 24hrs so that is also a plus. The rooms are spacious with sofa beds and the staff is very friendly. This is a great value and an awesome place for a family trip.,1
"I rented a non-smoking room for 4 days. Soon as I opened the door, it smelled like smoke. The door handle for the bathroom kept falling apart. Management never fixed. Everytime I exchanged towels for clean ones, there was an issue with them. I had to wait 16 hours, for 2 towels! Very disappointed.",0
This hotel is located in the center of the wine country. Good for planning your trip to the wineries in the area. Like all the finger lakes .great cheese outlets ..and tours . A great place to start and get information is the wine and culture center in canandaigua. .also they have a tasting room.. not bad prices for it... More,1
Room was amazing but the breakfast was lacking in selection. The breakfast was free and the quality of what was there was very good. I would stay at this location again if work brought me back trough this area,1
"I stayed at this hotel for a week for business, and I was very pleased! The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

There are quite a few places... More",1
"Very outdated, terrible water pressure, not enough towels in the room for a couple and the AC was very old and loud. Owner was nice but a 125 a night was way too much. If it was like 75 for the night the rating may have been better. The only reason I did not give this place one star is... More",0
"I travel a bunch and lean toward staying at Marriott locations. I was delighted to have spent several weeks at the Residence Inn in Richardson Texas. Location, consistency, cleanliness and good people on staff. Lisa, Johanna, Josh, Laila, Linda, Sylvia, Sheila and Vanessa all were welcoming and helpful. Thank you all!",1
Stayed on 6th floor and all was quiet. Evidence of remodeling was on many floors and in the stairwells. Employees were pleasant and helpful if and when you needed them.,1
I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!,1

We hope you will return to the Hampton Inn often!!!",1
"Bad: TV CABLE didn't work, kids bored. Good: Location",1
"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless.",1
Very pleased with everything about the hotel. Great position overlooking Santa Monica pier. Staff friendly and helpful especially Tony who helped with our cases when we left. Only downside was the bedside lights going off if there is no movement in the room. If you get up in the night you have to fumble your way to the door to... More,1
"Best room we have ever had...large, modern, modern bath area, large fridge, good wifi, good lighting, nice breakfast. Plenty of shopping restaurants across the highway. Close to airport. I would recommend this motel for anyone. Probably best value for the money that we've had.",1
"The hotel staff is always friendly and courteous. The elevator on the far side of the building seemed to be slow and not working at times, but there are two sets of stairs and one always working elevator so I really can't complain too much.",1
"Very close to the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Duck Tour ride. Our room was close to the Monorail track but there was not much of disturbance. Walking distance to all attractions or you can take the Mono rail to down town locations. Very good breakfast. Rooms were very good with a small kitchen.SriGa,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way.

"Everyone including Ismael at this hotel went above and beyond to make our experience great. The hotel is a bit pricy but the location, service and comfort of the room made it worthwhile. Proximity to Santa Monica Pier, the Promenade shopping area, restaurants- All great too...",1
"Furniture and fixtures were in desperate need of repair and updates. Desk was wobbly. Furniture was scratched. AC unit looked like it was going to die. Toilet seat was worn and needed to be replaced, etc.",0
This location is well above average for the comfort suites chain. No hesitation to recommend fit an overnight or longer stay.,1
Bad: The street noise was pretty bad. Honking horns til all hours. Hard to sleep. Good: Loved the continental breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to go far. The staff was great and it was a great location.,1
"Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners.",1

"We live 30 minutes from the Hotel. We wanted to spend the night downtown and see the fireworks. My wife and I stayed over the 4th of July weekend. The location was great, near the park and Peace Center. Many restaurants near by. We ate at the Nose Dive, under the hotel. Had burgers and beer. The room was disappointing because it was so damp from the humidity. The AC was cool enough, just too damp.",1

"What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system.",1
"We staid at this hotel for two nights. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great! The Lincoln Park Zoo is 5 minutes walk away, there are multiple bars and restaurants in walking distance and even downtown (Millenium Park) is walkable (about 2 hours walk if you walk slowly and look at all the other fun buildings around). The only negative about the hotel would be bathroom. It was clean but old and in need of an upgrade. We would stay here again if we come back to Chicago.",1
Our room was clean and comfortable. The bed was also comfortable. The staff was very courteous and helpful.,1
"My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend. Upon our late arrival, we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay. There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our 'settling' for 30 minutes, but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation. The room was lush but small - neither of us minded, since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any...view moreway. The view was great, and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you couldn't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness (though, Saturday was a bit louder than Friday). Room service was excellent and speedy. Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean. We didn't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room, but plan on staying here again - it's in the middle of everything and a really great value!view less",1
Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.,1
"Really nice hotel in an awesome area of Cali. Love this city, A LOT!!",1
I so wanted to give this hotel good marks but I couldn't. The dcor was nice but the air conditioning unit was broken and we sweated all night. It was unusually warm for this time of the year so we were really hot. The unit also made noises and kept us awake. There were also ladybugs crawling on me in... More,1
"I spent two days here on a business trip had never stayed in a Drury before. This was a very pleasant surprise. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, helped me out when a scheduling mixup (my fault) could have led to serious difficulties. Breakfast was very good and they even had a 5:00pm snack time with hot food, popcorn, etc.... More",1
"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.",0
"The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations, prime location and friendly staff. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit!",1
"Staff does a very nice job. The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great. Close to downtown Franklin, 20 minutes to downtown Nashville. Very quiet and comfortable. Our stay at their location in Findlay, Ohio was equal to this.",1
we love this place. the staff is always very accomodating and the rooms are super cute. the remodeled rooms are our favorite but the other rooms are nice too. great place for the price.,1
The room was clean and comfortable and plenty of space. The hotel had a 70's vibe but has been updated. We liked the room decor and bed. The hotel is a stones throw from the I-5 fwy and you can hear the traffic and see it from the door. Our door had an obvious gap between the frame and the... More,1
"Lacks true value for money Stayed here twice now, and there's no doubting this is a fancy hotel inside and out. However, be prepared for staff not carrying out their duties properly, excessive queues at check-in and check-out, and long walks across the casino to get from the elevators to the front door. Then there's another long walk before you... More",0
"My girlfriend has spent the last eleven weeks at the Country Inn and Suites while she has been attending law enforcement training in Athens.

Hotel is dated and needs updating. Free continental breakfast was a disappointment. Will not stay here again.,0
"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas",1
"I've stayed here several times. Spacious rooms, clean, efficient staff. Nice workout room. Always surprises me that they don't offer a free basic breakfast. I'd stay here again but do wonder if there's something better available.",1
"Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there. Thank you for a great stay.We are so glad our staff was able to make your time at WoodSpring Suites a great one. The WoodSpring Suites team strives to make your stay one you wont forget. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and we hope we get the privilege to serve you again soon.",1
"We arrived at almost midnight after a long day of flying in from out of the country. The staff member who checked us in was so pleasant and helpful and even gave us 2 complimentary bottles of water. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and a great location to BWI. We would definitely recommend the Hilton.",1
"Jack Huff's has delivered again. We've found this to be one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. The rooms are bigger than the major chains, friendly staff and clean. It's a little old school with reservations and room keys but we'll worth it.",1
"Stayed here 3 nights for work. It's a great area, lots of good restaurants nearby and easy uber / commuting distance to if you're sight seeing. Room I had was slightly upgraded and was lovely. Very big, bathroom was huge and had a double shower, one was like a fire hose - great to wake up to! Food was great,... More",1
Rooms could use some updates: Beds a bit lumpy. Rugs need better cleaning. Desk in room wobbly. Chair uncomfortable. Breakfast: Eggs powdery. Staff was generally friendly and helpful.,1
"We checked in at 3.30 am and the lady at the front desk didn't seem happy to see us. No greeting or smiling. She quickly gave us the keys and didn't bother to give us any information on breakfast timings or free wi fi. She was rude in short. The guy during check out was very friendly. The room was clean but the beds were very hard. The trash can in the room was nasty and when i looked at it by mistake i lost my appetite. It wasn't bad, but not worth the price i paid for it. For 10 more i could've stayed at bigger hotels close to it. Oh and breakfast wasn't anything to die for. We ended up not eating there.",1
Enjoyed a good night's rest at the Riverside Inn which has been kept in lovely shape and affords a wonderful view off each room's balcony right alongside the Rogue River. Room was very clean and bed comfortable with plenty of pillows and crisp linens. Full breakfast served by helpful and friendly McKenna. Office staff helpful as well. Very good value... More,1
"The propose of this hotel is that you would fell like home. The main differentiation from the Hampton inn for instance is that has a small door and a separate living, so if you cook or simply pop a popcorn, the smell won't take over the whole bedroom. I would recommend this hotel specially if you need to be in... More",1

"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"We stayed here for one night in April 2011 as one of the stops on our Route 66 journey. We arrived early evening, and having read in the guide books that this was a cheap and cheerful stopover, we intended to drop our things and head into Oklahoma. This was probably the most basic motel we stayed at, but very... More",1
"The hotel was located close to Gwinnett Center and restaurants. The price was very reasonable considering it had: large refrigerator, flat screen TV, internet and microwave. I have stayed at other hotels that cost more but did not have these features.",1

"The four seasons is the best hotel choice in Punta Gorda. Location close to down town, the marina and the path along the harbor is nice. The ability to walk across the parking lot and sit in a chair in the sand and enjoy the harbor and a drink and a bite is wonderful.",1
"This hotel was great overall--clean, decent sized rooms, and good breakfast. However, the only problem was that I was told when I booked it that it had a free shuttle. We were counting on using this to get to and from ACL. There was no shuttle, so this added some extra cost and planning. I would stay here again.",1
"Very large rooms, well decorated, large bathrooms. Public spaces are chic. Rooftop pool and restaurant are scenes and fun. Not too stuffy. Nicest upper end hotel in area. Definitely now my go to on West Side",1
Bad: Lighting in room. Good: Location staff,1
"To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience. In the same way that the hotel service was a consistently delivered, high degree of service, without being over the top,... More",1
"As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay. We are continually working to enhance the guest experience and will use your comments to do so. We hope to see you back next time you come to town.",1
"Good motel, comfortable, enjoyed the hot tub. Friendly staff. Clean. No breakfast. It was a close drive to Mesa Verde National Park. Quiet. It was next door to a good restaurant. It was a close drive to Durango.",1
Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport.,1
"This was a return trip back here and we were still very pleased with our stay. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was well appointed and immaculate. My only complaint was out sleep number bed, which was pretty much like sleeping on some rocks. To adjust it, a horribly loud noise came out. But I understand they are... More",1
Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!,1
"A great location for beautiful sunsets, great food close by, and whale watching! We really enjoyed our stay.",1
Very good stay for what I spent,1
We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here.,1
Bad: Even though we asked to have the room cleaned they only folded the towels..had to ask for clean cups and coffee!. Good: No smoking hotel...love the beds!,1
"Hotel is clean and well kept. Rooms are usual Microtel fare. Water pressure on second floor left something to be desired. Beds are very firm. Biggest issue was internet begin almost unusable after 5 PM. Once more than a handful of people log on, you're plagued with frequent drops and buffering. Really holds back a good hotel.",0
"Overall stay was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The coffee was great! Typically I do not care for hotel coffee - it was probably the best hotel coffee I've had this side of Europe.Dear laylemsp, Thank you for your stay and a great review. We are glad you enjoyed our clean and comfortable room. Our staff are constantly undergoing training to provide 'Premier' guest service. Look forward to hosting you here again soon.

"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"Our stay was short but convenient for what we had planned. The price was great. My only negative would be that I was not allowed to accumulate Wyndham points, because I used a booking agent.",1
We basically picked this hotel off the internet by the nice picture. What a pleasant treat it was right from beginning to end! I cannot say enough about every aspect of this property and I will be staying there for certain on my next trip to New Orleans!,1
"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing.",1
"This was my second stay with a Ramada branded hotel.

Bad: I requested 2 beds.the room had one king size bed. Staff was rude.,0
Nice hotel good price. Need a hot breakfast added. We asked for extra pillows and were told they didnt have any. Pillows are worn and small.,1

"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",1

Nice place convenient to airport before or after a flight. Airport shuttle between airport and hotel. Parking available short and long term. Comfortable room with sofa and work desk. Good burger place just across the parking lot.,1
All as expected!,1
"We stayed with our two large dogs in the unit with the kitchenette. It was actually a very large one-bedroom apartment! Located above the office, it had a partial view of the ocean. Even with the two big dogs, we probably didn't need quite that much room. Great walking trail that the dogs loved just steps away. Office gave us... More",1

"nice room with comfortable bedding and pleasant staff (especially the gentleman at the front desk)... only issue was the lady who worked in the breakfast room... she was having a meltdown over people eating the bacon... it was embarrassing... otherwise, a very nice experience",1
"The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste. Although the staff is very nice, we requested toothpaste 4 times within 3 hours before it was finally delivered. Still, the stay was adequate for the price we paid in this area.",1
"We were late in booking on a holiday weekend, so we booked what was available. I probably wont choose this again, unless we are in the same situation, and in that case, I would probably still pay for better. Not the worst hotel, but could be way better. Breakfast was no bueno, we only tried it one day. Our bathroom... More",1
Nice place to stay. If I have to go back to Houston I would consider this hotel again.,1
We were impressed at the thoughtfulness of the staff. There is a complimentary breakfast which starts at 7:00am but we left early so we would miss it. The staff offered us bagels and bananas to take with us on the road. A small but truly appreciated gesture. The room was large and comfortable. Good for traveling with a family. The only issue was that the bathroom door did not close well. We did not address this with the hotel as we were just there overnight.,1
Staff was extremely rude. Shockingly rude. Zero customer service skills.,0
"Overall, this was a nice hotel in a convenient location. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a little expensive considering parking, Wifi, and breakfast aren't even included. We didn't have time to check out any of the restaurants or amenities. We enjoyed our stay.",1
After several trips to Vegas each year for the last several years The Aria remains one of my favorites. Classy place with great features. Very centrally located so you can get to many shows and other casinos.,1
"Most comfortable beds to sleep on and the Bobby the breakfast waiter is fantastic! Great way to start the day. Very easy check in, rooms were also very clean, housekeeping does a great job! I wold recommend the Benson to everyone!",1
"Room not as promised on Hotels.com! Supposed to be a view of river instead we got View of Parking lot and back of Hotel...kept it as a running joke for rest of trip. Called the desk and they said they just didn't have any other rooms. Otherwise Hotel is well maintained. Cost 15 for self parking..not bad for a city downtown I suppose. Certainly a good bed, clean rooms, efficient elevators etc.,quiet, friendly staff",1
"Everything about this brand new Holiday Inn sparkles from the artistic reception area, to the inventively-furnished breakfast room, to the tasteful suites. All of the equipment is brand new and in great shape. Catch it before the inevitable aging process! Staff are very welcoming. Breakfast surprisingly good for a big chain hotel.",1
I highly recommend this hotel! I wanted a modern hotel that didn't look like most of the San Fransisco historic hotels. PROS: Clean. Beautiful. Great views. Perfect location. Friendly Staff. Affordable prices. Floor to ceiling windows! Bathtub. CONS: I couldn't find any cons!,1
"Hotel appearance is modern, very clean and stylish. It looks very upscale and was a bargain for what we paid per night (mid week).

No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.",0

"This hotel is right on the river, which probably makes it the best one in Yuma. The city has done a great job of creating their river walkway, but the restored historical downtown is not worth your time. The room was very small, but a wonderful, helpful, friendly staff and a surprisingly excellent restaurant, WHEN the real chef is there.... More",1
Good: The breakfast was good and the bedroom was comfortable.It was within walking distance of the freedom trail.There was also a shuttle bus to the airport within walking distance.,1
Just a wonderful time the staff was outstanding.,1
Bad: Room decor a little outdated. Air conditioner too loud. Walls a little thin so neighbors can sometimes be heard. Good: Value relative to other hotels. Location was convenient for exploring the strip.,1
Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to.,0
We were in Orlando 3 weeks and spent the last 4 days at this hotel before heading back to UK! It's a fantastic family friendly hotel can't fault anything thing! Both my kids 12 and 8 loved all the free activities and the pool was amazing better than blizzard beach water park as per my daughter!! Well worth the money!... More,1
Very satisfactory and comfortable.very convenient and met all our requirements.,1
"We were very pleased with the room and thought the location of the hotel was great. It was a no hassle experience to bring our dog which was wonderful. The only negative was that they couldn't find our reservation right away, but that may have been because we have a two part last name.",1
I stayed in a room near the vending area but it was pleasantly quieter than I would have expected. Also Major renovations occurring on all floors so it was dusty but no noise was heard at night.,1
Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.,1
"Great, friendly, helpful staff. Nice bar/restaurant. Huge room.",1
Loved our visit. Would definitely room here again in the future.,1

For trip to Dollywood.was impressed with display of HE is Risen on electronic sign. Nice to see a business not afraid to display Christian belief.,1
"The building and rooms were great, as was the staff. The decor was beautiful. The location convenient. The only issue was some slight dirt in the bathroom (but I am picky!). I would totally stay here again.Thank you for filling our out survey. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay with us! We look forward to having the opportunity to serve you on your next visit to Wichita. Have a nice day!",1
Very nice hotel with lots of character. Would like frig and microwave in room. Other than that the hotel is great.,1

Coffee maker didn't work dirty hallway . Wi-Fi was poor. I couldn't even believe it so I took many pictures. Do not stay here you... More",0
"We were dropping off my daughter at UF it vas very convenient just about a mile from her dorm, we definitely will be staying there when visiting her . It was very clean ,they have enough parking . And complimentary breakfast is always a plus !",1
"The location was super confusing, don't attempt your GPS. I called ahead, and they gave me directions led me right to the hotel. The hotel itself was outdated and def could use some work. The room was fine, with the standard amenities that is offered bu Holiday Inn Express. The breakfast area was in the lobby, a crapped area, but... More",1
Had to call maintenance man to fix shower. More water going out of diverted than shower head. They did fix it. Heard people walking in room above us. No counter space around sink.,1
"Check in was easy. Room was clean except that it appeared that the toilet was not flushed. All free coffee, bottled water, and bath essentials were fully stocked with clean linens and sheets. WiFi worked great.",1
"Nice hotel, with good rooms and beds. Location is not really close to Riverwalk and it would take you a good 15 min walk to reach there. Alamo is relatively closer. There is nothing much right next to the hotel. Breakfast, checkin, checkout and the reception staff were all good. Breakfast staff could have been a bit more courteous.",1
"We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states.",1
"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, convenient to the airport. We stayed here during an NFL football game and I couldn't be happier. The hotel was close to the airport and downtown Atlanta, the staff were very friendly (even though we were fans of the opposing team). Our stay included parking, wifi, and breakfast",1
"Basic rooms, nothing fancy, but clean. Decent breakfast included.",1
"This has a really nice swimming pool. A good breakfast, and you can dine beside the pool, and it's right beside a mall and there is a shuttle right to the cruise port. The challenge is that the rooms were clean but really old. Paints been put on the rooms but it doesn't disguise the age of the building. The... More",1
I stay in this hotel 3 to 4 times a year. Rooms are always clean and the staff is courteous and quickly resolve anything that might come up. All staff members go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay.,1
Shower was broken. People upstairs paced for at least two hours from 2 to 4 AM.,0
"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!",1
Location was great for sightseeing. Neighborhood very poor where hotel located. Rooms were comfortable and clean....only issue bathroom was small. Exercise room needs some updating though. Breakfast was adequate.,1
Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.,1
Room lovely. Staff lovely. Pool amazing. Slow service on the roof bar - I waited 30 mins for a drink on a less than busy bar on Saturday night.... Oh and the paid parking and continental breakfast isn't justified really considering the price. But I am giving 5 stars regardless because I did love it so much. Would def come... More,1
Very nice. the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. They were so helpful. Sabine (sp) was especially helpful.,1
"Disappointed with the breakfast, have to wait for food, was too slow",1
Older motel but in nice shape. Good location close to the dam. Room was a little dark with the older wood paneling. Breakfast was good with plenty of food. Staff was helpful and nice. Parking was a little tight in front. Looked most of the people staying there were there to go fishing.,1
"Home 2 was a nice hotel to stay at, and the staff were respectful and delightful. The room was clean and spacious, the appliances and technology. Not sure if the hotel has rooms with bathtubs, but a bathtub would be helpful with small children. The grandchildren loved the indoor pool, and the sofa bed. The refrigerator and the microwave were... More",1
The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded.,0
Bad: I didnt like being charged 35.00 a night for parking when everything I needed was within walking distance. I will choose a different place next time.,1
"This is a newer place, clean and friendly service. For the business traveler this is great, one of the more economically friendly hotels in Napa. The location is good too, easy on and off and not far far from downtown. I slept great, nice clean comfortable bed. Overall really nice. Dear JimWard99,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your feedback on our clean and friendly service. Thank you again for taking the time to review, Serina Najar.",1
"I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and highly accommodating. The hotel is clean. The food market located directly across the street is very interesting and they have anything you could possibly be craving. The coffee downstairs is free with to-go cups and it's actually delicious.Dear barbieann12,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Park right in front of your door! Rooms have flat screen, wifi, micro, fridge. However, no coffeemaker. A little on the high side compared to similar places we've stayed, but still reasonable. No ice machine either.",1
"Get more than what you pay for, Hotel ran well and good atmosphere. Very accommodating.",1
"Good: Great location,comfortable beds,very clean",1
"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More",1
My family and I drove about 4 hours to visit Weeki Watchee Springs very early Saturday morning and had reserved a room for the same night sine it's less than a mile from the park. When we got to Weeki Watchee the park was already full and we didn't really have a plan B. The hotel was very accommodating and... More,1
"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!",1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Pool, food/bars, enormous room, large bath room, gardens, staff",1
"We waited for everything and it was never worth it. The resort section is nice for older kids, but not much there for my toddler. Very disappointed with everything: We did not get into our room until well over an hour past check in - and they have a late check in time! If you have trouble walking but do... More",0
"Bad: Drinks expensive at bar Rooms have a view of a wall Staff take a deposit and do not put back on your credit card. Good: Rooms were modern , staff friendlly , location great",1

"Good: Great location. Clean room, friendly staff. Would definitely stay there again.",1
"The first room I was given had a very strong, unpleasant (musty) odor that did not go away after an hour with the window open so I went back to the front desk to see what could be done about it. The person at the front desk was very helpful and said that they had one other room available near... More",1
Great hotel for the money!,1
"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.",1
We requested 2 beds. We got only one. There was a recliner positioned in a strange place in the room. The room was for handicapped people so the shower had a seat in it and a hand held shower head. Not tall enough to stand under.,0
"Great, look foward to staying there in near future. Affordable, spacious rooms.",1
Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.,1
"The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed.",1
"Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!",1
Would be a 4 but the elevators are terrible. You have to wait forever. You even take escalators down to lower levels to get enough space to ride the elevators up. Other than that a nice hotel. Pretty river view from some rooms kind of makes up for it.,1
"There City of Baltimore was having a water problem because of the extreme cold temps. The desk staff did not tell us at checkin that we may have a water problem in the room. We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore.",0
"Great hotel all around. Friendly service, very clean and quiet with a convenient location. Highly recommend!",1
"Our room was clean and the check in process efficient. It is a very well kept property. But, the most outstanding thing about this Hampton Inn is PATRICK DEWBERRY!

"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby",1
"This place needs a serious reno to stay alive. I booked with Expedia, specifically asked for 3 people in one room. The hotel still charged me 5 bucks extra for that, when we arrived. I think the admin costs of doing that was more than what that 5 bucks covered. Not very smart. We arrived late, around 3:30 AM, and... More",1
"The worst television design I have ever seen in any hotel. I'm a very frequent traveler and have stayed at MANY 4 and 5 Star hotels.

We drove in with no reservation and the staff were friendly and helpful. They only take cash or check. oThe kitchen was nice but there wasn't a microwave or cookie sheet. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little soft.,1

A car picked them up, then dropped them off minutes later. As I peaked out the window, I saw that this went on all night.... More",0
What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value.,1
The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights.,0
Very highly recommended. Outstanding staff. Great location. Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Tastefully and creatively decorated public areas and rooms. Restaurant very good as well. Stands out as a unique and exceptional vacation experience.,1
Good: Location and comfort,1
"Stayed at this property while on a convention. Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated. Noise is a problem, though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that doesn't face the street side, as the party goes on all night.",1
I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.,1
This is our second stay at this location. Their customer service is top notch. Good breakfast every morning and very clean rooms. Beds and bathrooms are very clean. Used the pool everyday we were there and loved it. We will stay here every time we're in the area.,1
Was disappointed there was not alot of eating places around.,1
"I have never been disappointed by a Hampton Inn and this one maintains that track record. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms and most importantly bathrooms were clean and smelled nice. And the price was right. For my purposes the location was convenient, so I have no complaints.",1

"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left.",1
Comfortable... Pleasant / nice Breakfast / Its near Restaurants / Shopping / Publix and more Easy Car exit and entrance. Employees very nice and the room was clean and inviting. Landscaping was nicely trimmed as well.,1
"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team",0
"Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)",1
Very clean hotel the beds very nice and close to the airport.,1
"We came for the weekend. The room was clean and the beds comfortable enough. The breakfast was good - with selections for those trying to be healthy. We had hard boiled eggs, oatmeal and fruit. The only down side is that you hear your neighbors which could be awful if you were stuck next to someone really loud. All in... More",1

This Hotel was clean and well kept.. However because I have children they put me on the Same floor as other children. I was woken up many times throughout the night by screaming children and they were not my own!It was very loud throughout the night of people talking and running up and down the hallways! I was quite disturbed by this. Overall the room was comfortable just very loud and obnoxious people that happened to stay there which is unfortunate.,1

Grand Haven Michigan is one of those places that has remained great over time. It combines history with the present for those in for business or leisure.

The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit.",1
"Very pleasant stay! The front desk Bill was very helpful, very good hospitality for all hotel staffs too!",1
"Uneventful and fine except I was told they could Not print invoice for charges,because it was booked through you. Call me and i will give u the name of the employee and you can be sure i have called my credit card company to check on what was posted.",1
"This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard.",1

"For the it was OK, I would stay again, the TV is an off brand and Made some noise on some channels, breakfast is OK, but nothing to write Home about frozen egg Mc muffins. I would give it 3 stars max",1
"Very friendly staff...accomdating and hospitable. Room was decent, but hotel does allow pets and we had 3 yipping dogs across the hall. They did not disturb our sleep, however they barked whenever they heard us going in and out of the room or talking loud in our room.",1
"We made our reservation late in the day, but we scored a good deal especially for as busy as it was. We were put in a room right where the elevators were, but we didn't have any problems and slept well. The bed was a bit too hard and the pillows way to soft for me. The hot breakfast is... More",1
"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately.",0
Our stay we very brief -- only overnight. It was average. Nothing negative.,1
"Room was clean. Hotel located at a busy intersection. Windows were so outdated, every outside noise was heard. A lot of traffic noise. AC unit kept coming on snd off so frequently, it kept us awake. Initially when we arrived, no one was at the desk. Had to wait several minutes before being helped.",1
"The linens were very clean, and the pool area was beautiful. The entire desk staff was eager to give on point recommendations for dining and attractions. Great value for the price paid. Request ground floor- there is no elevator.",1
"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!",1

"Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!",1
"Bad: No complaints or dislikes. Good: Quality vs price was fantastic. Check-in was very friendly and above reproach. Cleanliness, comfy bed, quiet, and your typical serve yourself breakfast. Couldn't have asked for more for the price.",1
Came in late and stayed one night for a concert at RedRocks. Close to the venue. Good view out the window of the foothills. Plenty of food options in the immediate vicinity.,1
Bad: Need higher wattage light bulbs in bedside lamps. Larger pillows for bed. Good: Like the character of the hotel. Unique. Nostalgic. Bars and restaurant are fun. Friendly staff. Good food. Reasonable prices.,1
Clean and nice rooms. Freindly and knowledgeable staff. There are two pools one inside and outside and both were in great shape and clean. The resort has a nice beach with Kayaks you can use. Very pleasant experience!,1
"It was a wonderful experience.the room is nice, clean and spacious. The location is accessible to shoppers and they have a hotel service to the airport.",1
"The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision.",0

"Absolutely LOVED this hotel. Truly the best service, food and location. Classy and polite staff. Our banquet food was delicious and always fresh throughout the day. Staff would whisk away all dishes and place settings when we were finished and my glass or cup was never empty. Accommodations were great. Big beds, big rooms, big bathrooms and an amazing 360...

"My kids and I travel through Harrisburg on our way to see my parents in VA once a year or so. We always stay at this hotel as a stopping point and have never been disappointed. For the price, it is extremely nice. Beautiful lobby, free water and coffee, nice indoor pool, clean and well-sized rooms. Staff is nice and... More",1
A very good experience. We were most impressed by the wonderful breakfast buffet. We will definitely stay her the next time we are in Ogallalla. All in all...a delightful hotel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.,1
"Have been coming to hotel for decades and have previously rated it highly, but it changed hands since my last stay and is now under new management pending demolition for larger hotel. All staff appears to be new. Day of arrival, called hotel en route to warn of late arrival. At first hotel telephone did not work. Finally got through... More",0
"We were very tired when we arrived with a cranky baby. Pierre at the front desk was very helpful and got us in our room quickly. We had some difficulty with the door, the handle had to be pushed up, instead of down, which delayed us getting into the room. The room was clean though somewhat worn/dated (old phones, ceiling in bathroom had areas that needed repair/patched, carpet was threadbare in some areas, etc.). We were thankful that the room was very quiet which help us to get a good few hours of sleep before my daughter and grandson's flight. The shuttle driver that took us to BWI was exceptionally helpful and I was very grateful that he came back to pick me up after seeing my daughter and grandson off.",1
"This is a friendly, courteous, clean, comfortable hotel with a terrific breakfast. A 5-star family hotel that is also in a convenient location. We appreciated being able to open a window for fresh air. The king room is really comfortable and convenient with sitting area. Wifi worked smoothly. Looking forward to returning.",1
"Always a great stay at the ARIA, love the rooms and dining options. Tables get a little high on weekends but that happens. Great location and shopping nearby (high end,shopping) Highly recommend Todd English PUB for drinking and Serrano for eating",1
"Loved the hotel. Very nice. Great Pool, golf and activities. There was no reason to leave the resort. Rooms were nice and food was very good. A bit pricey though. Not a vacation if you are on a budget. WE would go back- had a very nice time.",1
"Good location, easy access to restaurants and hospitals.",1
"My niece gifted me with a weekend at The Westin for my birthday, and from check-in to check-out the experience was nothing short of fabulous.

"I stayed here a few years back, and it was pretty nice. Not fancy, but overall very good. Wow, what a difference a couple of years makes. Must have new management or something. First off, the cable was out (all but 1 channel). Not a huge deal for me, but was told other rooms had cable, so I switched. The... More",0
"The room was clean and in good condition. Would stay there again. The free breakfast was mostly good except for the biscuits that got staler every day. Made me wonder how often they made the biscuits. Friday they were good, by Monday they were very very stale. The scrambled eggs were good on Friday through Sunday. Monday They tasted different and weren't as good. I ended up having to throw mine away and eating a muffin instead.",1
Good: The beds,1

Only an overnight stay this time but I know I will be back. The room was perfect as always. I was on the 5th floor in a king superior room. I had no view although it didn't matter at all. We had drinks on the patio outside the bar and it was extremely pleasant. Dinner at Atlas was superb and... More,1

We are glad you enjoyed your accommodations, our friendly staff, fresh hot breakfast and all our amenities. We look forward to your next visit! Sincerely, Michael",1
"We rented a King Suite here, because there were no rooms available for under 200 within 50 miles. We were pleasantly surprised at the quiet location and the cleanliness of the room. We slept with the window open and the AC off for most of the night. It is pet friendly, and the dogs were quiet. The room provided typical... More",1
"Bad: The first room - AC not working. No hot water in bathroom. The second room - was not totally cleaned. Leftover shampoo, conditioner, and soap were found in tub area. AC is noisy.",0
We staid only for one night and this probably was the best option in town. Rustic but gemtlich as we germans say. The owner is a nice guy and we had a great talk with him about some families from Conrad. We highly recommend this place if you go to Conrad.,1
It had roaches... Roaches.,0

The business meeting facilities from the meeting rooms to the AV/tech support was very very good. Every detail was taken care of for me. The food in the restaurant and provided in the meeting space was very, very good.... More",1
Beautiful location for a hotel. Love the fire pits on the hotel grounds that overlook the ocean. The hotel sits on above a beautiful big sandy beach that is great for family and yet still manages to be romantic.,1
Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good,0
Bad: Parking was horrible. I mean 182 for a room that wasn't all that and then pay 35 just to park. Parking should've came with the 182. Good: Breakfast in the am,1

"A winning team starts with good management and coaching. When the person in charge displays a good work ethic and positive attitude, the rest of the team will follow that example. The team at Springhill has that leadership and it permeated through the entire stay. During the busy days at breakfast, the GM could be seen bussing tables and refilling... More",1
Bad: The lobby is not adequate. You have both Check in and ways out at the same place. Good: Very good value for money and location,1
"So-so, it was ok. Location is not the best, nothing arround.",1
"This was a nice hotel. The building is old and has been there for a while, but the room was clean and the furnishings were nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.",1
Up to HGI standards. Expensive bar drinks but comfortable and close to I10. Quality breakfast (free to Diamond members) Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff throughout. Great accommodations for the price and close enough to FSU campus.,1
"We needed a place to stay close to the venues for a basketball tournament, and wanted a Hilton property. Other than wishing breakfast was complimentary, we had no complaints and were very pleased with our stay. The neighborhood alone is worth the decision to stay at this hotel,",1
"This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa.",1

Our extended family (6 adults and 3 kids) stayed in the Cunningham Suite (3 bedrooms + pull out couch and full kitchen).

We stayed 2 nights while visiting Matha's vineyard. Very nice hotel. We stayed on the third floor. Very quiet. Beds were nice. Room was very clean. Room had fridge and microwave. Tv had a lot of channels to choose from. The hotel is located in an area that basically has everything. Front desk was curious and friendly. I can only... More,1
"Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again",1

"Bad: no fridge in the room. Good: Close to the airport (free shuttle service), big, comfy bed",1
Hotel was beautiful. Parking is weird. Paid 20 a night or you have to figure out how to park outback for free. No microwave or fridge in room only avaliable in suites. They kept messing up on room charges. Charging a 150 deposit fee saying it's a 50 fee per night you stay. Didn't make sense. Double charger a friend who was staying in the room next to ours. The staff was nice. I think it was a lot going on due to graduation season.,1
Bad: Dirty windows in the room dirty carpet in hallway and dirty door for service entrance 3 rd floor. Good: The gentleman at reception and the valets,1
Amazing and super courteous staff. Cleanliness is impeccable and the atmosphere was very inviting. Better than good breakfast buffet as well. Would definitely recommend as I will also stay here next time I'm in town.,1

"Stayed here on my way to Canada from Phoenix. Check in was smooth and front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They had some sort of free soup and salad bar at night and breakfast in the morning. Room was very clean and modern at a good price. Room had HBO package, a fridge, microwave and had USB charging...

"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept. I also found out it was recently remodeled. Would def stay there again.",1
"After a long drive it was nice to come to a nice, comfortable hotel and a quiet one.",1
I have never been to such a place in my life. The room needs a deep clean or totally revamped. Then we had noisy people in the next room. When I called the front desk the night receptionist did come to to tell them to turn the noise down but was ignored. We complained again only to be told that... More,0
Bad: The fact that we were not able to take advantage of the heated indoor pool..it closes 9:00pm does not re-open until 4:00 pm the following day... Good: The accessibility to area attractions the breakfast bar was wonderful!,1
The access to the property was not very well marked so it was very easy to miss the turn into it upon first arrival. The window to the room would not open as it appeared to be half of a sliding window. The wood around the window was OSB that was just painted. The door was very warped and drafty... More,0
"The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose. I must say the bathroom was in great shape, there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new. It served the purpose",1
"We stayed in this quaint motel for 4 nights while in Santa Monica. Prior to arrival we were tossed between staying here for 2 nights and then going to Hollywood for 2 nights. I was so happy we stayed! What a wonderful place. The staff very friendly and helpful, a big shout out to Tom who was so very helpful... More",1
"Very nice hotel, only complaint was that the pool is very small so if two families are in the pool it's overcrowded, but would definetly stay again.",1
I had issues with every hotel I stayed at this week. Plus the traffic in Springfield stinks. I picked this hotel because it was in a small town not far from my first stop the next day. Room was fine it was quiet bed comfortable. Breakfast was ok. I'll stay here when I have to work the... More,1

Good: Great location, cozy enviromenment, friendly and helpful staff. Very clean room. I've Aldo seen the Dr Vranjers air perfumer in the reception! Loved this place and his style!",1
We came down from St. Louis for a funeral and needed a room. They only had a suite left. It was nice and clean. We enjoyed the snacks then went to the pool. We were the only people in the pool. It was clean and warm. Breakfast was good too. We will stay here again if we need a room.,1
"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.",0
One elevator for this large 10 story hotel was not good. Also all the hallways and elevator were extremely muggy and hot. When we arrived we had to park in the far extra parking lot and carry all of our luggage I. The pouring rain bc they allowed bikers to park under the entire awning unload rock. Very dissapointed in that lack of customer service. Other than that we had a beautiful room with very comfortable beds and a great view.,1

"We stayed for 2 nights and the stay was comfortable except 1 person in the front desk was rude. Nice neighborhood, close to freeways. Good Breakfast!",1
The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.,0
"Very nice hotel that was close to everything we needed. Did not have to rent a car but still had a great time, lots to do within walking distance or short bus ride. Rooms were clean and well taken care of during our visit.",1
"The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road.",0

"It was leads than 80 for one night. But the room, the service and the breakfast are top quality. We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we go to Chicago.",1
Good: THE HOTEL NEEDS A BETTER COFFEE SHOP FOR QUICK BREAKFAST. WHAT EXISTS THERE IS ONLY OKAY...IT IS NOT INVITING OR OFFERS MUCH WARMTH.,1
"Staying at this hotel just made sense for us. My husband had to travel to CA and I had to stay in GA but about 45 mins away from the airport and we were very tired. It was so convenient for us to check into this hotel late evening, enjoy the ambiance and comfort of the hotel, get some rest,... More",1

We booked a standard room using points, and were upgraded for free to a Casita suite. It was incredibly nice. The only negative was the AC unit was loud and creaky and caused... More",1
"I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again.",1
Good: Great location....the room was very comfortable and clean. Nice breakfast and staff were helpful with directions to Chicago sites.,1
Very nice hotel in a good location. Staff was pleasant and welcoming. I was Hilton's guest of the day which was a pleasant surprise! I love Hampton Inns and find them to be a great value. Breakfast is an additional bonus.,1
"This was our 2nd time staying at this Hampton Inn. Both times we have had a great experience! We always stay in King suite. The price is reasonable per night, esp. if you are a Hilton HHonors member a AAA member, but if not, you'll still get a great price. You will not be dis-satisfied.",1
The entire excellent experience started with general manager Lourdes Yanouri. We had 7 people in our group (and stayed 3 nights) and she immediately handled all of the reservations and made sure we had all of the confirmations by email. They were waiting on us when we got there - the clerk even knew we were coming. The rooms are... More,1

Bad: Room was a little tight. Good: Comfortable beds: adequate bathing supplies,1
"Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better. I will be share you comments to our team so that we can try to make the correct adjustments. Please feel free to contact my Directly if there is anything that I can do in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manger",1

"We were very please with the La Quinta Butte, MT. The physical accommodations were very good, the bed was very comfortable, and the service was good.

Breakfast the first morning had molded bagels and fruit. I would check the food before you eat it.,0

My son and I spent the night here and found it to be very clean and the staff to be very courteous.,1
Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.,1

"Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show.",1

"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!",1

"This hotel was really good. The desk lady was very nice when we arrived, the room was clean, parking was right in front of our room.

"My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.",0

Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!",1

"The only problem we had with this hotel was the rude manager, but I am addressing that with their corporate offices.",1
staff very nice This hotel allows pets keep that in mind if you are not an animal person. I think the first floor is reserve for pet owners so if you don't love pets ask for an upper floor.,1
The facility is nice and has a great lobby and bar for happy hour events. Enjoyed my stay which was nice and quiet. The renovated rooms were very comfortable.,1

Pool is very nice, and it's located just close enough to the French Quarter to have fun but also sleep in a nice, quiet hotel when you've had enough fun! Loved this place!!",1
"The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again.",0

This is a pleasant location with a very helpful staff. I was greeted in a friendly way and my room was as selected on line. The location is perfect for my meetings with FL Government representatives. I would recommend this hotel in Tallahassee.,1
Hotel was great. Provided shuttle service to rental car facility and airport even though was very early in the morning,1
I agree with everybody that rated this hotel low. It is pretty bad my wife did not feel safe and the room had a musty smell. Staff was ok but location and people around was scary. We ate our dinner and promptly left. Did not even bother try to get our money back.,0
I booked this hotel for a concert I was taking my teenager to. The room had cracked and nailed badly crown molding. the area close around the bed had not been vacuumed in quite some time. The shower had NO water pressure. On the positive side the beds were comfortable and the pillows were great!,1
Was not pleased that it rained my stay because I did not have a chance to visit the pool. The food at the grill was really good! Great turkey club and burger!! Awesome drinks......needed more alcohol but good. Shuttle from airport little slow but staff wanted to make you comfortable.,1

We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again.,1
"Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way.",1
"Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated. Service was polite and prompt. My room was great: clean comfortable and again, tastefully decorated without looking suburban-generic. Try to get a balcony room if you can. It's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room! Loved the rooftop pool, we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"It's for our weekend get away, and it was a pleasant stay at Homewood Suites. Will go back there.",1
"After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly.",1
"Located in the sleepy town of Westfield, this Best Western was exactly what it was intended to be. It's a no frills, business orientated hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast punctual and delicious, the staff incredibly accommodating and courteous and the location central. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers.",1
"This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,",1
"I have stayed at this hotel more than 15 times in the last 6 months, and I've had nothing but wonderful experiences. The staff is friendly and professional. Breakfast is delicious and offers much variety. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable and the location is great! Free parking is a bonus!",1
Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem,0
"Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon. We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service. If your travels ever bring you to Atlanta again, we would love to have you back as our guest.Warm Regards,Justina H.General Manager",1
This was a very nice hotel for the price. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was nice. Close to many restaurants and other business establishments. They do not have a work out facility but do have an association with the local YMCA and you can go there to exercise free of charge. I will go back there again when I have business in the area.,1
Have stayed here twice before. Friendly and helpful staff. Providing convenient shuttle to Metro. Good stay.,1
"I stayed for 3 nights with my family. We enjoyed it. It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills. The stay is almost half or less than half price of Embassy suite in downtown, but it is only 15 min by metro from downtwon, and 1 stop by metro from the airport. It is an absolute great chioce to stay there.",1
"The staff were extremely friendly. Randall was very informative and helpful. The location is great, across the street from the Santa Monica pier. The room was quiet. The walls between bathroom and bedroom were see-thru glass. But there is a really cool privacy shade the lowers. It was clean and modern looking.",1
Excellent property that was very clean. Staff was extremely friendly.,1
Just finished four nights around Thanksgiving and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel (see Westin Princeville review - that hotel is good but I prefer this one) tremendous service and facilities ROOMS - we took advantage of a Hyatt sale and got a suite that was over-the-top fantastic so not sure it's comparable (suite here was much better than 1 bedroom at...

A perfect location for a weekend excursion from NYC. This hotel is approximately 20 mins from two NY wineries one being the Brotherhood Winery which is the oldest in the USA. This Hampton Inn has a delightful all-American all-you-eat breakfast buffet. This Inn is a great value for your money and the location. Also pet-friendly.,1
"We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away.",0

Bad: No description of the complimentary shuttle service to universal. One shuttle per day leaves at 735 am. Would not have booked here had that been clear. Also when we arrived our booking clearly stated that we had two adults and two children. They gave us a room with a king bed. The hotel is not outside the gates of anything as the description stated also. Good: Breakfast was excellent,1
The hotel was very clean and was very comfortable. It seems to have been kept up real well. I would've gave this place a higher rating but I felt disrespected by a bald man that serves the breakfast.

"This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.",1
"The hotel was up to date very clean. The room was roomy comfortable enough for us to entertain family. Breakfast was wonderful! They had made to order omelets, bacon, fruit, etc which is free. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that someone was smoking marijuana on out floor children were running wild! Otherwise a good experience I would stay again!",1
The staff was very friendly and they made check-in super fast. My family and I got there a little early they checked the room and since it was clean they got us in early. One of the best stays I've had in a hotel. We will definitely be staying here again in the future.,1
Lots to do within walking distance. Staff friendly. Have to be Hilton Honors member or you have to pay for Wi- Fi,1
"Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites. Without hesitant, go to the moon and back to make sure you feel at home. It's hard to find that at other branches in Metro Atlanta. Bianca N. and Shawn are the Dynamic duo. Whether you need something as small as dishes to needing a laugh. They are the perfect ones.Chanel, thank you for making Extended Stay America -Atlanta - Clairmont a part of your travel plans. We are delighted your stay with us was exceptional and that our associates exceeded all of your expectations. I will share your wonderful compliments with Shawn and Biance. Thank you for being our guest, and we look forward to that next visit.Sincerely,General Manager",1
"Given the price of this hotel, I hold it to a higher standard than a Hampton Inn. So, that said, the good: Excellent Location! Super friendly and helpful staff! Great restaurant that just opened! And very nice condo/suite that was comfortable and nicely furnished. THAT said...here is the bad! The housekeeping is terrible, and maintenance is sorely lacking! I took... More",1
"Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days.",1
"5 nights bed never made. Day 4, NO housekeeping too few rooms to bother .LOUD bathroom fan comes on with light. Can't see TV from sofa, only from bed. Full hot breakfast2 kinds of bread for toast, w/jams and frozen butter, instant oatmeal, 3 cereals, sm blueberry muffins, and waffles. Coffee, and 2 juices. Overall- poor (Choice)",1
"I pulled into Motel Parking Lot that was empty except for homeless guy with his shopping cart. Motel Sign light blinking as if burning out. Broken bed frame tossed away at side of building. Didn't even get out of car, went to Hotel next door. when calling to cancel, was met with questions as to why, owner not very understanding.",0
"This hotel is super!!The staff is friendly, and very competent. The room was spacious, and clean, and the bed comfortable. The location is good, and there is a restaurant around the corner. Very quiet.",1
"Honua Kai was the perfect place for our honeymoon! Located along the coast, Honua Kai had both the ambiance of the ocean and the view of the mountains. It gave us a great homebase to travel around the island - both rurally and to other towns' downtown areas. The service, the food, the atmosphere - all just right and just... More",1
"We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away.",1
We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Virginian Suites Hotel. Like staying in an apartment it was so spacious. The hotel is convenient to everything and within walking distance to the metro which I did because the traffic was so bad most mornings I could beat the hotel transport. Everything was clean and they even have a breakfast. We would stay here again. Also very quiet for sleeping.,1
"This Microtel is immaculately clean, everything is sparkling and the service is topnotch and responsive. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are up to date and immaculate. There is even a mini-Laundromat with coin operated washing machine and dryer. Every morning there is an elaborate breakfast with lots of choices of fresh, tasty food.",1
"I thought it a little pricey for the condition of the hotel, but overall not bad. Pool area was nice, bar area was nice.",1
We stayed here for one night on our way back home from a vacation. It was a wonderful experience. We got the King Suite with a Jacuzzi in the corner of the room. Everything about the stay was super. It was close to restaurants for dining and they served breakfast early so we could get back on the road.,1
"We love staying at the Pioneer Inn Best Western Maui. The location is great. In the heart of boats, shopping and dining. We can walk to beach too. We stay with our two young kids. They love it too. The pool is a great to cool off in after a day at the beach. It is very quaint. We have... More",1
"I'm just being honest here. We booked this hotel because we were traveling with our two dogs on our way to FL. The lobby seemed nice but if you have a dog with you, you are sent around to the very back to the C building. There is so much construction going on that the back parking lot is extremely... More",1
It was a great experience I would recommend them to anyone,1
"This was hands down one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Granted I wasn't spending a lot of time around a pool or in my room but its located nicely and had amazing beds. The most important factor was the customer service. When I pulled into this hotel in my taxi, the staff was out the door to... More",1
"Front desk staff was so nice - very accommodating and welcoming. Room was great - balcony to the courtyard, comfortable furniture, big bathroom with his/hers sinks was very convenient for getting ready quick. The pool/hot tub area and outdoor fireplace was really enjoyable - we used it all 3 days we stayed. There's even a Starbucks on site, and a Kinko's which was nice for some things we needed to quickly print off. I would definitely stay again when visiting Orlando.",1
"We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was very courteous and friendly. It is always nice to see our staff mentioned.

Good: Very good service. Excellent dinner in hotel restaurant,1
Not a 3 star more like 2 star. Small room no fridge or micro. Old style room.,0
"The property is very attractive inside and out. When the sun came out I noticed flower baskets hanging under the staircase on the main building and some trumpet vine, and fuchsias blooming on the hillside. The decoration and practicality of the interior is very well planned. The interior pictures of nature and local scenery provided cheerful ambience. I noticed the... More",1

"Stayed at Blue Harbor because my spouse had a work meeting there this weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed the bright and clean rooms. All the staff was friendly and accommodating.

I had a change of plans in my day and went in to check in at 11am or a little after so I wouldn't have to at 2am. The front desk staff was very accommodating and allowed me to with no hesitation. Room was very clean.,1

We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.,1
"Got a king room for special rate. Had late flight in so unable to comment on evening snacks and drinks. Breakfast was good. Room was nice and clean, however, would not stay here if not for the special rate received.",1
Very trendy hotel in the Charleston downtown. Easy to walk to most attractions. Beautiful lobby and nice staff. Much lower price than other hotels in the area but had everything we needed. Check out Jestine's right around the corner for some delicious Southern food.,1
"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It's very close to the Atlanta airport, which is convenient, although we did hear the planes off and on. It has a small Starbucks inside the lobby, and fresh salads and wraps for purchase anytime also.",1
Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location,1
"I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning.",0
"Our room is 24 (second to the last away from the highway). We had booked 17, but we are told that the occupants are extending. The rooms are different prices and differently equipped.

"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT",1
Bad: N/a. Good: Modern and fabulous,1
"We stayed two nights here. The plus side: Clean room and bathroom Name brand cereals, yogurt, etc. at breakfast plus fresh fruit Great wifi Negatives: Dirty hallways Worst coffee EVER However, we would go back there if we return to Palo Duro! I would take my own coffee!",1
"Bad: Old outdated rooms, even though its a classic hotel does not mean they dont have to put forth effort to modernize rooms. Good: Was right in Fremont street",0
We had no problems staying here and were treated very good. We would stay here again in a minute. The staff was very helpful in letting us know where to go and have a great meal. The rooms were big and had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable.,1
This hotel has a style to it and I like that aspect given the sameness of so many places. The rooms are fairly narrow and laid out like a loft space which won't agree with many business travelers expectations. The location is OK but anyone who lives or travels here knows the freeway miles will be logged in the Big... More,1

"The room looked like it was recently redone, it and the lobby were very attractive. But be aware that the closet rod (really a cabinet) was one foot long and there was not a single drawer for clothes. This would be a nice, reasonably priced room for one night.

We had no tv. Would not work even with staff. Toilet seat almost fell off when using. Kids kept running on floor above until 11pm.,1
"My extended weekend stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. I have no complaints. I would strongly advise, though, that guests make use of the shuttle service to and from the subway station. However, the immediate environs of the hotel are quite pleasing. There is an international supermarket in the plaza across the street. Quite a convenience.",1

"They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it.",0

With a big clean comfortable king size bed, a microwave a small refrigerator, coffee maker, and this time there was a larger upgraded flat panel tv . Everything was clean and comfortable. The owners are very kind and nice to chat with.",1
"We arrived and immediately got told we were at the wrong hotel. I pulled out my confirmation proving that we were not. The gentleman went in the backroom and, after much cursing, yelling, and get them out of my hotel we were told they were full and couldn't let us stay there. We felt genuinely concerned and left even though... More",0
"Arriving after a long flight, it was a delight to find such a tranquil, beautiful haven. My room was large and full of lovely antiques and there was everything a tired traveller could wish for. I've already recommended it to a friend.",1
"Just as expected, Hampton deserves a pat on the back. The staff, facility and accommodations were excellent. This location comes highly recommended and knocked it out of the park. My family will be back the next time we're in Knoxville.",1
"The hotel room itself was clean, spacious, and in good repair. We, however, had problems from beginning to end with the booking process. We blocked rooms for an anniversary party. Guests were either told the block was full or didn't exist. My husband and I extended our stay by one day upon check-in. We received 4 phone calls from the front desk by different people asking if we were checking out. Front desk staff was very disorganized and uninformed. I would not recommend this particular hotel.Dear jenniferrB6116DR,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We truly appreciate all your feedback. I will personally be looking into the details of your blocked rooms.

We booked this hotel through VRBO website ten days for 3 of us. It was enjoyable experience. Parking lot right in the front of the main entrance but we used underground one.

Everything was brand new as it was in the last 10 percent of being renovated. As such- it was beautiful. The website picture indicated it was old as they hadn't updated the photo yet so I was more than pleased to see the new remodel! Great location to the outlet malls and breakfast was wonderful.,1
"No problems here. Just an overnight stay before moving down the road. This is very close to I-78. Some road noise, but not bad all things considered. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was typical for Holiday Inn Express. Wi-Fi speed was a solid 5 up and 5 down.",1
Our 2nd stay at this hotel. Everything was great and we will be staying there again on our next trip. The facility is nice and so is the staff. Beds are comfortable and nice breakfast in the morn. The computers in the lobby made it easy for us to print out airline boarding passes.,1

Very safe area. Shopping area and restaurants nearby,1
"Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about.",1
This is a all new hotel. Excellent security and rooms. Don't let the neighborhood fool you. They are very nice owners.this is one of the few spotless hotels in va. Beach for under 100.00.the breakfast has more food choices than anyone really needs.,1
Stayed for 4 days here. The Amenities are awesome. The staff were friendly. The only thing negative during my stay was that I lost money from gambling. The beer was expensive here. Otherwise the whole experience was exceptional.,1

Perto de uma estacao de metro. Transporte gratuito para o metro. Quarto enorme. Camas enormes. Cobertas confortaveis. Tudo limpissimo.,1
You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe. If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.,1
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",1
"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix.",1
Our first stay at this location it was ok.. Very nice breakfast not much room to sit though. Found internet ok in lobby but not in the assigned room. Would stay again but need the internet in the room. Room was very clean and bed comfortable . I do recommend some sort of non slip surface be placed in the... More,1
You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel.,0
"Never had a bad experience with this hotel. The staff is not only professional, but fun to interact with. Hot tub was very enjoyable, as was the pool. A good variety of restaurants are available in the area. A great place to use as a stopover for further travel going South.",1
"The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get.",0
Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.,1
"On a recent road trip, we stayed at several hotels - mostly Best Westerns. This one was by far the best of them all. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and fresh and the breakfast area had the most variety. They had lots of fruit, which was hard to come by in the other hotels. Everything was... More",1
"Beautiful room, ocean view, fridge in room, DVD player, balcony",1
This hotel is perfect I jave com 2 times and is beautiful is right next to the beach it has a really nice pool and Yolanda an employee from here is so nine and carring is all thanks to her that we are having a great time,1
"Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. We appreciate your candid review of the amenities and services offered at our hotel and we hope to turn your average experience into a superb visit the next time you are in the Orange County area. We apologize for not meetig your expectations on this last stay, but rest assured that we take all of your comments into consideration when looking for ways to improve on the quality and features offered at our hotel. Please feel free to contact me personally when you are in the area again, as I would be happy to assist in any way possible. Warmest Regards,Adam Sahagun",1
Bad: Expensive. Adding tha taxes become heavy. Good: New age. Excellant service,1
The staff could not have done more to make our stay in Charleston so pleasant. Can't wait to return and see the renovated lobby. Perfect location for exploring!,1
"As others have mentioned, this is great location not only to I-5 and the airport, but also to numerous restaurants nearby. Welcoming lobby area. Front desk staff were very personable and professional. Room was clean and comfortable with fridge microwave. Excellent option was a double vanity. Very nice stay.",1
"This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle. When you drive up to the hotel there is a sign to self parking. No sign for valet, just self parking. So you follow the sign to find yourself in a gigantic and full parking lot with... More",0
"The hotel is in a very nice residential street of Waikiki which makes it close enough to all the action but still walking distance to it all. The staff is very nice and attentive. I stayed here after a long day of traveling and the staff could have not been any more accommodating. Even gave me an upgrade! Sleek, fun,... More",1
There for a week and every day every staff member was very helpfull. They have a shuttle to the metro station and the drivers were very nice. They even gave us their cell to call them so we won't have to wait. The cleaning crew was always helful and friendy. The room was super and the beds were really good. Breakfast was good and you have the convenience of a 7eleven across the street to pack some water and snacks for the day. For shure we'll be back to this great hotel. THANK YOU!,1
"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future.",1
Friendly and helpful staff at check in. Offered on the go breakfast since we were leaving before breakfast opened. Perfect location if attending the Linn County Expo Center. Great value compared to other local hotels.,1
:-),1
"Bad: Had wifi problems for the first 4 nights. The resort fee is a bit of a scam. Good: Very comfortable bed, good sized room, well appointed gym and free parking.",1
"They tried to put us right next door to a bank of rooms they were remodeling - mattresses and carpet rolls in the hallway, men working until very late, etc. We were there for just one night for new years eve to be close to wineries. Good location for that but a little pricey just because of the day. Nothing special but adequate for what we needed.",1
We had a great time. Everyone we met was super nice. Lots of amenities. We enjoyed our stay.,1
"Great location in Crystal City - near the Airport and Metro. No car necessary to see DC. Hotel is comfortable for families and quite affordable compared to others, especially if you need more than one room with kids. Breakfast buffet is convenient and nightly reception is nice as well. The pool is small but adequate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.",1
Hotel is ok. Rooms could be cleaner and smell better. If you are looking for a cool hipster venue...this is it!,1
"We often visit Sioux Falls for a quick get-away for a few days. After trying a few other places, this has become 'our place' to stay.

"We stayed two nights at the Nordic Lodge. We found this place online and it was everything it was advertised to be. The staff was very friendly, bed was very comfortable and we loved the private patio off our room and also the large deck off the pool area. Both faced the woods. Our room was equipped with a small... More",1
Good: Great value. Great location.,1
"First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!",0
"We stayed here for a sports tournament recently. Compared to the experience of families who stayed at nearby hotels, our stay was fine. The breakfast set up was better than usual at inexpensive breakfast-included hotels. The fitness facility is simple but functional. the pool was clean and the rooms were spotless and comfortable.",1
We decided to go on a little getaway weekend to Chimney Rock to unwind from a very stressful week. Of course we chose the Esmeralda for our lodging which seemed like the perfect place for a relaxing night away.

"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay.",1
"I've stayed at this motel multiple times over the years. This motel works well to give you a nice warm place to stay overnight in the cold winter months. Of the times I've stayed here about once a year, and each year there is some improvement over the years. It's still a cheap option for housing. I personally don't have... More",1
I paid 46 dollars a night using a booking sight. Yes the place is run down but it does look like they are doing improvements and starting with the rooms.

"We travel fairly often and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the most strange experience we have ever had (in a bad way). We pre-paid three nights' stay.

When I checked in the front desk staff was really helpful and nice they upgraded me rooms because they were out of 2 queen size beds and they let me know at check in so when I went into the room the beds were so big my kids loved it because they had a big bed and the room was... More,1
"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive.",1
"During my recent stay at the Hilton I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. However, the staff made the correction and re-cleaned the room. I had a great stay, the food was great and the restaurant staff was wonderful. Overall the stay was nice and the hotel was quiet.",1
"This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!",1
"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind",1
"Extremely disability friendly! Staff was awesome (especially Seph who kept us laughing!). This hotel is centrally located with restaurants near and far depending on your taste. The front desk will give you a list with a multitude of different types of restaurants. The hotel itself was clean, great water pressure and actually had a healthy fruit option for breakfast.

"Upon arriving at the hotel, the check in process was really easy. We were given these memory card/stick things as keys. Opening the door was loud as when your key was accepted it beeped.

My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October. Make sure to ask for me when you arrive and I will make sure to have more suggestions for you.,1
It was lovely and relaxing. I will come again! Thanks,1
"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1

Plenty of seating and newspapers available to enjoy breakfast. Staff was super friendly. Whole experience was very pleasurable. Will definitely stay here again.",1

"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance.",0
"The Residence Inn in Naples was a great place to stay in Naples. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite after the first night which was very nice (I'm a Platinum member). Thanks Lauren! Close to downtown, beaches and plenty of restaurants. The pool area is very nice and all of the staff was great. Highly recommended for families.",1
"Staff was compassionate, Room was very clean. Nice modern amenities. I will stay here every time I am in the area. easy check in and check out. Plenty of parking. Has a pool and nice fitness room but I did not use them/",1
"The rooms are actually really nice and updated. The common areas are older and outdated, but rooms are surprisingly nice. Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis, but a third the price.Nice new fridge and microwave in room. My dog was allowed at no extra cost. Room was quiet. Couldn't hear hallway noise. If you don't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere, swimming pool, pricey restaurants, etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking, come here. Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of. Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty, but everything else was perfect. Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking.",1
"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",1
Bad: The 'bathroom' area was open to the sleeping area. It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger. It was just a little odd. Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Good: The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay.,1
"Stayed during high season in Phoenix. Not super chi-chi, but super solid. Impeccably clean room, clean lobby, clean grounds. Friendly staff. Cheesecake Factory walking distance a bonus. :-) Easy to get to from Phoenix ingress on Highway 60 from East. Great.",1
"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",1
"I almost always stay at Best Western properties. I like supporting independent owners. This hotel was everything you could want in an overnight stay. Clean, comfortable and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",1
"This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back.",1

The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all.",0
The property was beautiful. It was a perfect getaway spot for a busy couple looking to unplug. Highly recommend the cottage with the outdoor tub and shower - it was wonderful. The restaurants on the property were also great.,1
"Stayed here after doing the Escape from Alcatraz triathlon. just loved it. Had a good massage and the restaurant was just an absolute delight. The rooms were inviting, the staff was friendlier than I have met in any hotel. When I could not get big enough taxi for my Equipment they really took it an arms lenght and ended up... More",1
Attended a conference here this past weekend. Hotel is not too far off the PA turnpike. Near some local shopping. Free parking. They have an onsite restaurant. Banquet food was rather good. Rooms clean and nice size. Only thing I did not like was the room service dirty dishes that sat in the hallway all weekend.,1
The Virginian Suites is a great hotel with an extremely friendly and helpful staff.,1
One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff.,1
"Located very close to SLO Performing Arts Center which was very convenient. Room was clean and appointments were ok. Check in was a bit strange, no towels pool / Jacuzzi area, lots of traffic noise from HWY 101. The price seemed high for the accommodations, and we were given a room adjacent to the elevator, which made for more... More",1
"Great staff and location was perfect to hop on a van pool for downtown. Staff was helpful and great parking lot. Needed space since I was pulling a trailer rooms were spacious. Breakfast was awesome would stay againDear Recent Guest, Thank you so much for staying at the Embassy Suites Nashville Airport. I am so glad you enjoyed all aspects of your stay. Thank you for your business, and we look forward to seeing you again in the future.",1
"It was memorable stay in Aria Resort, very good valet service and friendly staff at the reception. Rooms are big size and all the controls are at our finger. Ample shopping area and great restaurants. This city center hotels and resort is very attractive structure and good value for money and much more.",1
"As always, our room was very clean. The hotel itself was up to date and clean. Breakfast was excellent each of the four days. I left my laptop charger and housekeeping was right on top of it in getting it back to me.",1
"Very dark/ limited lighting. Shower handle fell off, room keys not working,.. Back down to the desk for new ones 2x, hotel steamer used for getting wrinkles out of black tie suit/ gown was overfilled w/ water and puddled in the room,... But staff responded quickly/ apologetically. Nice indoor/ outdoor space for complimentary breakfast and appetizers in am/ pm. Great location kitty corner to Chelsea Market, near Highline Park, Chelsea Pier",1
Bad: The meat at breakfast was horrible. Cheap no taste and the yogurt was horrible to I can tell it was real cheap brand . Good: The reception was so nice she let me check in early and the room was very clean. My kids love the pool.,1
We used hotel's free shuttle service to the Metro station daily during our vacation. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. We noticed two negatives in the room: the paint in bathroom was pealing badly and the tub did not drain well the first day. We reported the drain issue and they fixed it while we were away the next day. We had stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and we will likely stay here again in the future.,1
"I was at the Aria for 3 days for a conference. Everything about my stay was impeccable. The rooms are fantastic and very hi-tech, the pool is great and the food is incredible. The common areas are not too loud/ smoky. It's near other cool hotels so you can easily walk to the Mandarin or the Cosmopolitan. Nice staff. I... More",1
"Mia met us with a generous smile at the front desk as we checked-in to this spacious, clean and wonderfully staffed facility. Drury Inns, a new and fully delightful discovery for this writer. Hallways are well illuminated and the entire building is scrupulously maintained. Economically priced well-appointed, well-lit, surgically clean rooms in excellent condition. Bargain price includes a kick-back evening... More",1
"Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable.",1
"i made a reservation for July 11,2015 and when i arrived to check in they had already given my room to somebody else and said they had no reservation in my name . Bashi Patel your business is a joke and you have been reported to hotels.com and the BBB and i am not through yet!",0
Overall this is a nice hotel. However I did encounter a group of rowdy cheerleaders who were Loud. I had to complain each night about the noise but it was handled. Rooms were clean and Comfortable. I would stay here again. Sometimes you just have to complain if your stay is Unpleasant. I was compensated for my inconvenience.,1

"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price.",1
We booked this hotel last minute. We thought it was going to kind of A mediocre room. When we arrived there was plenty of parking and best of all parking is free. When checking in the two gals at the front desk were very pleasant. Check in was super fast and easy. When we arrived to our room we were... More,1
"Nice Room with good size flat screen TV. Resturant pricey and limited menu, food was good.",1

"Modern facility near center of town. Polite, efficient staff. Room was well appointed and clean. There was very little outside noise from adjoining rooms or the floor above. Complementary breakfest was very good. We would stay here again when we are in the area.",1
My stay at the hotel was only one night but it was great. I so enjoyed watching the planes take off.,1
"Nice hidden gem that places you right in the proper spot for walking. A nice bar inside that opens at 5pm. A Starbucks for snacks. Neat office area for working. Great use of building. Winter pricing is great. Parking is in a garage nearby. It does cost about 30 dollars a day with validation. Staff is friendly, areas clean. Well... More",1
"We stayed for two nights when we ran the RNR Half Marathon this past weekend. We were extremely satisfied about our stay. The room was clean, and we had the best view of the river! We cannot be more than happy with Tania at the front desk!! She was awesome, very helpful and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again.",1
"Stayed here twice. Nice location, quiet rooms, and good amenities. If you are a night owl, bring your own alcohol and snack, last call in Delaware is 12:45 and the only eateries that are open would be a convenient store or Dunkin Donuts",1
"This is my third stay at this location. Overall, its just a great place to stay. The staff is very friendly, professional and always eager to assist you. Despite being near the expressway the rooms are extremely quiet. Very comfortable beds with good choice of pillows. Plenty of hot water. Internet speed in the rooms very good via wi-fi. TV,s...

"Good, basic accommodations to take a break while driving up the East Coast from Florida to NY. Asked for and got a quiet double for a reasonable rate upon arrival. Breakfast effort is better than the actual offerings.",1
"I have stayed in this area a few times and think it is among the best if you are approaching D.C. from the south by car. There is a nice shuttle to the nearby Metro and mall area so you can stay parked for your stay. If you have to drive, it is closer to D.C. and Arlington then it looks on the map. The rooms are a bit small but reasonably comfortable. Breakfast is a notch above the usual fare. Best of all, price is affordable for families or for the business traveler.",1
Bad: No parking except Valet for 45 a nite....too expensive. Good: Location,1
"This was our 1st stay at the Wisconsin Dells Best Western. We have some handicap, mobility issues, so requested a handicap room. We were pleasantly surprised with the family sized room with plenty of space, lots of beds, and A plus comfort. We were concerned that this motel was a distance from the Dells attractions, but realized we were near... More",1
"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!",0
"The rooms are smallish but up-to-date. Very clean and sleek, two of us did not feel cramped. The hotel provides unlimited cold, filtered water and bottles for you to put the water in. They also have coffee, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. The views from the river view rooms are spectacular (we were on the 7th floor). Location is central. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The restaurant has a great mushroom with mozarella de bufalo and risotto appetizer. You really cannot ask for a better hotel!",1
"The Hyatt Valencia, located near Magic Mountain in non-descript Santa Clarita is a dressed up basic hotel. Adding lots of marble flooring and mildly hip decor cannot disguise some neglect and oversights that lower end chains now provide. The ice machine was out on at least two floors the night I was there, and there are no electrical outlets near... More",1
We had a great stay at the hotel. Very friendly staff and beautiful location just a few blocks back from the main street of shops. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Waikiki. I would say that the friendly staff were what made our stay here most enjoyable.,1
Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues.,0
"I visited Greenville and we stayed at the beautiful and historic poinsett westin. The service at this hotel was absolutely exceptional! Everyone from the front desk staff, to the management to housekeeping and the pianist in the gorgeous lobby! They were happy, helpful and kind. The breakfast in the hotel was affordable and delicious! The rooms were spacious with the... More",1
"Will not stay again as they place pet friendly rooms along freeway section that has no sound wall barrier. Then give earplugs within the room with a complimentary note. A five cent earplug, and you drop 170 a night to listen to a roaring freeway.",1
Bad: Ping pong table was broken (net) Sat. afternoon and packed away for a meeting Sat. night. Good: Personnel were friendly and attentive. We were able to check in several hours early.,1
"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business.",0
"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.",1
"Hotel was very clean, nice amenities, friendly staff. However, the transportation company they partner with are less than honest. They sell you a round trip transportation to cruise port for 60, and then the hotel tries to charge an additional 32 to go to the port.",1
Staff was very helpful and courteous.,1
"I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there.",1
"Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located",1
"easy in and out, two decent restaurants next to the hotel (a mexican place that is expensive and an outback). clean rooms and helpful staff. a little pricey but that's to be expected there aren't really any other good options in the area.",1
"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan",1
"Bad: no breakfast incl. Good: close to action but off the strip, so quiet",1
"The stay was on the Concierge floor. Room was very nice but the water pressure is very, very low. Single ply toilet paper when you pay over 300. per night is unacceptable. Quiet and out of the way for very busy Tampa. Excellent self parking. Stay on the Conceirge floor for the breakfast. It is excellent with a huge choice.... More",1

"We have been staying at VRC the past 7 weekends! By far the best bang for the buck you can get in Vail. Great staff, great units, and the kids love all the activities. Thank you so much Vail Racquet Club!!!",1
"This is an older property but it's clean. Nothing fancy, and I wouldn't recommend this for more than a night, but it was fine for what we needed. Breakfast was okay - more cold carbs than anything else! There is a Denny's in the parking lot as a back-up!",1
Bad: You can hear everything we could even hear folks snoring in the next room!!!!!. Good: Location,1
"Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!",1
"The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room. We care about the comfort of our guests so we'll address your concerns with our team moving forward.We hope for the opportunity to host you again soon for a more positive experience.",0

"This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again.",1
We really enjoyed our stay and loved the location as it was close to everything yet apart enough to have room on the beach and in the water. The food and service at Duke's were excellent. The service at reception and the bellhop desk were good but not great - only a few required interactions with them so it did... More,1

However, we were very pleased with the exceptional service from the staffs at this hotel. Every single staff was friendly, especially, Evelyn, from Spoon Bread restaurant. She made... More",1
"Bad: Could have initially had more room towels. Good: Villa Paradiso was minutes from the beach. The hotel also provided BEACH towels daily so you didn't have to worry about the hassle of towels. The room was fully equipped with a kitchen. Great for late night snacks or meal and keeping leftovers cold in the fridge. I felt very secured at the hotel. The outside gate had its on key so that was a bonus. Walgreens is right across the street, we may have visited it a dozen times. Will book again when I come to MIAMI.",1

"This is one of the newest hotels in Key West. It's located in the new section of town and is about a 15 minute car ride to Duval St. The rooms and facilities are modern. The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. I apologize for that lack of assistance regarding your air conditioner, and I will be getting with my staff so that they better assist our guests better when they are having issues with our hotel. I hope that you will return so that next time we can better serve you.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1

"I liked this hotel a lot. Service was friendly, suite was sizeable, clean, comfortable, with a decent view. Nice neighborhood with good nearby restaurants. The only issue I had was that the bed was too firm for my taste. Not too far from the airport and the mall.",1
"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me.",0
"We stayed at the LaQuinta only one night, but will return at every opportunity. They're pet friendly which is wonderful. Now my baby can be our traveling companion. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and we were very pleased with our stay.",1

"Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have.

"First let me say what was good at the hotel. When I checked in the gentlemen at the front desk were very friendly but never saw them again. Second, the lady that did breakfast service every morning was very sweet and always treated us well. The bed in my room was also one of the most comfortable hotel beds I... More",0
"nice hotel ,good value being out of DC but not much around area , so if you dont mind being away from night time activity and just want a base to explore DC from it is ideal",1
The bed was very comfy and the breakfast was good plus the location was good close to stores and resturaunts. Loved the Jacuzzi tub very relaxing. The vending didn't provide water but stores were in walking distance plenty of towels and wash cloths provided just wish I could of got the room at a less price but overall very satisfied.,1
The breakfast was good even thought it's the same thing every day... I will recommend for a short stay.,1
"We enjoy this hotel because of the room service, the lounge bar in the first floor and our favorite is the iridescence resturant in the top of the building. Im also a big fan of the. D. Tour spa. I'm not a big gambler and I think the casino is over crowded most of the time but I still like... More",1
Wonderful last minute rate. Beautiful hotel in prime location.,1
"clean, good area, very kind crew, easy to park",1
this is well big and nice place to stay for holiday trip,1
"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!",1
Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street.,1
The hotel was clean and the imenities met my needs.,1
"Bad: Breakfast consisted of too much carbs (i.e. mainly bread, pastries and cakes), with no non-dairy options. Also the inability to use the stairs between floors without getting locked out!. Good: Location was great for the business conference and also shopping. The staff were friendly and always willing to help.",1
"I'm very happy with that particular hotel! The room was very neat and clean, staff very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible. The frontdesk employee gets 10 out of 10 points for friendliness and service. It's convinient location will suit anyone nomatter if you're travelling for business or for pleasure. I would highly recommend Days Inn Glen Burnie to everyone who is looking to stretch their vacation dollar and yet have fun and comfort of a higher class hotel!",1
"We were very happy with the quality and cleanliness of the hotel. When shelling out money for a hotel these are important things for me. Yet, I don't want to pay high end prices to get them. This hotel had met these things at the right price.",1
"We had two rooms on the second floor. Even though the rooms were listed as non-smoking it was evident the rooms had been smoked in at some point in the past. When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food.",1
Bad: The remote in our room did not work for the Television so we had to manually get up and change the channels. There were not as many facilities as we had in previous hotels Oceanfront and the cost was much more expensive then those hotels. The stay was much more convenient at the previous hotels than this one. Swimming pool is to small. . Good: It was very close to the beach within walking distance. Room had balcony so we were able to catch the breeze from the Ocean. Room was clean. Free guest parking. Complimentary Breakfast was great. Whirlpool was place to relax/enjoy as a spa you could say.,1
Good: The personnel were exceptionally kind and helpful. I would definitely go there again and suggest it to my friends.,1
"The room we had was very clean and quiet except that the AC was on the noisy side all night long. Bath room was roomy and clean. Bed very comfy. Breakfast needs much improvement. At 7:00 there was no fruit out, no hard boiled eggs out. They only had scrambles eggs and a few sausages out with some pastry. We... More",1
Joseph's service made our trip! He accommodated all of our requests and even went above and beyond to make our trip as nice as possible! He not only arranged our chairs and umbrellas by the beach but he also positioned the cushions and towels so that we were as comfortable as possible. He was amazing!,1
"The hotel was clean and neat. Staff was friendly. But it looks like a work in progress. The floors were basic concrete with no tile or carpet, the room only came with a small rug. The toilet was clean but didn't work too good. The fan in the restroom was very loud and about to fall apart because of some missing screws. The hot water took a very very long time to start coming out. And lastly, there was a big water leak in the last day that came from the ceiling in the restroom. We woke up to find a soaked floor and soaked toilet. Breakfast was good and the lobby was really nice. The pool area and the whole outside was nice as well. Now they just need to fix the rooms so they can match the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't stay there again only if I knew the rooms have had good work put into it.",1
"Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet.",1
"We loved the hotel. We came for the Kansas City Marathon, and found the hotel centrally located for everything. We had no reason to even get into our car to go out, except for our friends wanted to go to a restaurant that was not near by. Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor. We also loved the hotel was so close to the Marathon event. We definitely will return, and stay at this hotel again.",1
"This facility was very good with one caveat - door to room was in need of maintenance attention - not urgent and the staff was notified at checkout. The checkin and checkout was easy and the staff friendly. The location is near I-285 Interstate, with traffic lights to help access on to/off of the busy hour traffic. The breakfast area... More",1
Would not stay a 2nd night.,1
We had a great experience at this hotel. Everything was clean and in good working order. The staff did everything well. The breakfast was all fresh and tasty. Overall a great job supporting my family.,1
"We had our daughters wedding reception at the Westin and it was flawless...I mean EVERYONE raved about the banquet room, food quality, wait and bar staff.they made it fun for all, even for us nervous parents! The whole wedding party and guest were from out of town yet they made us feel right at home. Between the hotel and the... More",1
"Great people and location. Very happy I stayed here. Within walking distance of lots of restaurants entertainment ,and bars. The room was very clean and all rooms have a good view. I am looking forward to commit back next year.",1
Bad: Room was terribly dirty. Good: Location,0
Bad: The shower sometimes turned cold and the ironing board was a little too small. Good: The room was very clean and tidy. The location is minutes from south beach and the staff was very friendly even though I only talked to two of them.,1
"This had to be the nastiest place I've ever seen. Once you get past the tobacco spit on the walls and stairs, the Walmart shopping carts, and the dirty stinky clothes hanging on the hand rails you make it to the room. The room smelled like hundreds of cigarettes had been smoked in it and it had never been aired... More",0

"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit.",1
"Good: This is my first time in Chicago and I spent much time to choose the right hotel. And I was right in my choice! This hotel deserves the high rates because of great staff, wonderful cosy room with a perfect bed, bathroom and tasty various breakfast.The location couldn't be better.",1
My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for three nights while attending a wedding held at the resort. The wedding was beautiful and the staff and scenery was top notch. We attended the wedding during a busy time in our lives and yet we were totally relaxed upon entering the property!,1
"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.",1
"Really nice stay. Clean, modern room, comfy bed, good channels, great location (15 min walk from Disneyland/CA Adventure), but a very high security deposit of 100. A lot of money for someone if they don't know beforehand.",1
"Clean hotel, with exceptional staff. I would have given this hotel the highest rating, but unfortunately, they decided to put low flow shower heads in the rooms. My room, and other rooms, reported by friends who stayed here last weekend, all had the same complaint. They could barely rinse the shampoo out of their hair. It was that bad.",1
"The hotel is clean, size of the room was good and the pool area is nice, but the overall look of the place is cheesy, the AC in the room was noisy and hard to control, and there's no free internet! Worse than that, they have a tiered internet pricing scheme that went up to 40 for 2 days!",1
"Room seemed to be brand new, very clean, and was perfect. was completely 100 and more satisfied. The staff there was so friendly and nice I wanted to mention their names. Lindsey, Amanda U, Baylie, and Alex Patel........they were amazing.",1
Aria was an outstanding resort. Very nice accommodations. Great location. Easy access to parking. Wifi works great. Bedding very comfortable. Only complaint was no access to use of a mini refrigerator and onsite dining very expensive. Many other dining options close.,1
dirty room,0
"We had to be up in the area Buffalo/Niagara Falls for a new business venture and we didn't want to spend a fortune so we chose this property. From the front desk to the breakfast and most comfortable bed, our stay there was exceptional. I would totally recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay!!",1
The hotel was clean and quiet. It is close to BWI has a restaurant/bar and I would stay there again.,1

The hotel staff was wonderful. The room was comfortable and spacious. Good value.,1
"First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places. Coffee in the lobby, a newspaper at our door in the morning, and a wonderful whirlpool and sauna to unwind. Also, a fine fitness room.",1
"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.",0
"I had a project in the area which took more than a year. I also stayed at the Comfort Inn and the HI Express. They're all pretty much the same to me. Rates change over time, so I stayed at the Hawthorn Suites when they had the best price of the three. The rooms are nice, clean, and quiet. Plenty... More",1
"Angenehmer Hotelaufenthalt mit ausreichendem Fruhstucksangebot. Hotel wurde uberwiegend nur zur Ubernachtung genutzt. Positiv das Zimmer war sauber und komfortabel eingerichtet. Negativ, man konnte das Fenster nicht offnen wodurch das Luften des Zimmers nur durch die Klimaluftung erfolgte. Ansonsten freundliches Service-Personal. Der Shuttleservice funktionierte ohne Probleme.",1
"Clean rooms with no frills.It is in a good location for walking to shops and bars. It is a little expensive for what you get, big chain budget motels offer more for less cash. The pool was in use when we stayed. there was free coffee available in the office.",1
"My sister and I stayed only for one night. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was appreciated because we had a 8:15am pick up to the airport, there wasn't anytime for us to go out for breakfast. The clerk called and reminded us of our pick up time",1
"Very nice, clean hotel. The staff was very friendly. However, the room was very warm and even though I adjusted the thermostat it was still too warm. The windows will open a couple of inches which helped. It was 17 degrees outside and 85 inside. So, it didn't take too long to cool the room temperature down. The breakfast was good. They actually have real eggs and you can get them cooked to order.",1
"Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food.",1
A treat to spend first four nights in Maui here. Spacious 1 bedroom with nice amenities. Breakfasted each morning on our lanai as we watched sun rise over distant mts. Very good Snorkeling right at the beach. (But really loved snorkeling at Big Rock a mile beach walk away. Never used the pools but enjoyed one of the several hot... More,1
The motel has a pleasant classic feel and appearance which is slowly disappearing from our cities. It was clean and the grounds were well kept. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere.Prices were appropriate. The pool area is nicely set up.,1
We had great time,1
"We were in town for the Pearl Jam show and used trip advisor to find this hotel. For the money, was very nice. Clean, friendly service, everything was easy. Breakfast was solid, good location and easy getting in and out of downtown. Would definitely stay there again.",1
"My husband and I stayed over night, in a jacuzzi suite, for our anniversary. It was a beautiful room, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great, lots to choose from. The jacuzzi was nice, worked well, nice hot water, and very clean! I would recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone I know!",1
One of the best hotels by far the employees are wonderful the manager is very very friendly I just love the area it's a great hotel I would recommend anyone to this hotel the rooms are very nice and clean the housekeeping staff are excellent it's such a great hotel,1
It was really nice.,1
"Very good for a 2 star hotel. Room were very clean, restroom very clean. Everything was clean at the hotel. The front desk were always nice.

This is the second time staying here. The rugs in the hall are getting noticeably worn. It is a clean hotel and the staff are great. Everyone had a smile and said hello. The negative that comes to mind is the breakfast room is to small. We tried two different times to get breakfast with no success. Sadly we checked... More,1
Bad: Construction noise woke us at 6:15 am But I was credited 1 day of the resort fee for the rude noise. Good: Bed was comfy Free bourbon tasting and dessert in their bar was a plus,1
"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

I just spent 7 days in the Westin Poinsett and enjoy the time from arrival to departure. This was my second time in Greenville with Trek Travel. It's is the perfect venue for cycling.

"Our party of 4 adults and 1 child had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable in the spacious 2-bedroom suite. Friendly, courteous staff. Excellent amenities, including executive putt-putt course, TV club room, 24-hr convenience shop, and business center. Good breakfast and complimentary internet was a plus. An all-around pleasant hotel stay.",1
"Located right in the heart of historic Lahaina, you can't get a more convenient hotel for the price. It's a lovely historic hotel, very clean and well cared for. Yes, it's an older building and room sizes reflect the age (smaller - but they do the trick!). Yes, some of the fixtures are a little worn in, and there is... More",1

This Sheraton Four Points is unlike most others: has a distinctly contgemporary feeling about it with nice visual touches and comfortable rooms. The biggest surprise was the breakfast caf where made to order omelets were available along with all the other breakfast items you would expect. A very pleasant stay.,1
"I stayed in the Pontchartrain Suite so that my daughter her 9 bridesmaids could get ready. It could not have been any better! It was spacious enough for everyone, plus the hair make-up crew, as well as friends stopping by. I'd highly recommend it!",1
"Very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly, rooms were very nice and comfy, continental breakfast was good. Only thing that I would change would be to have some benches or seating outside. All in all nice motel.",1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoy the room layout because of the extra living space to hang out in. We also love the Reese's cookies as an evening treat! They are so yummy warmed up.,1
We moved to this hotel after a really bad experience at the Adam's Mark a few miles up the street. It was clean comfortable. The breakfast was very good and the meeting/eating space is great for a group! We also liked that we could walk to multiple restaurants and that it's centrally located.,1
"Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs.",1
Great place to stay staff very friendly and accommidating very clean inside and out good food nice place to kick back and relax pool area clean both indoors and out can get in some excercise too if you want,1
"Nice, clean, comfortable and affordable, all with a great hot breakfast and close to GMU. Wish they had an outdoor pool, but much better than local competitors.",1
"Stayed for three nights for the FIRST Robotics FTC regional competition in March. Room was OK, with large flat TV, refrigerator and microwave.

It even has a Keurig which is very nice. The location is perfect if you are going to the aquarium, Centennial Park, CNN, etc. There are... More",1
"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance.",1
"Was in town for business, stayed only 1 night. By far one of the best HIE i have stayed at! Whenever i travel i tend to stay at them. It is not that often and usually not in larger cities.

Nice remodel.,1
"nice hotel overall. very clean with good appearance. pool was clean. we only stayed the 1 night. had 2 rooms. very comfortable 2 queen bed room with sofa. breakfast was good. basically the same variety as other hot buffet offerings. packaged muffins, waffle makers, eggs, ham, cereal. wanted a location close to the Globe Life field.",1
"We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"Just have to give this hotel a thumbs up for making a great visit to the French Quarters even better. The workers were hospitable, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. We stayed in the two bedroom suite, and for the value, it was just right. The room was clean, everything was... More",1
Good: Central location. Nice cafe and a Starbucks on the premises. Easy check in. Very helpful concierge.,1
"Close to Midway airport, great shuttle service, good interiors for the price. Would readily stay again.",1
Loved the stay staff was friendly pool was nice coffee was great! The room was clean and bed extemely comfortable. I don't know what else to right this is making me right a whole story what can I honestly say that 200 characters this is annoying. Worst part of experience this paragraph I was forced to write,1
"The room was nice, but a bit small. The beds were supposed to be Queen Size, but were definitely smaller than Queen. The swimming pool was pretty small, too. Breakfast was pretty good.",1
I liked the proximity to the ball park. It wasn't a bad walk at all even with a toddler. There is a parking garage for 10 a day diagonally across the street. Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in.,1
"First, let me say that I'm the frugal one in my marriage but my husband booked this hotel because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. I was skeptical because it was a little pricey.

The Wait staff in Bar not so good and not friendly. The rest of was stay was very good. Clean rooms great location for the Duval Crawl. I will be back next time I'm in the area. Being I am a fan of Key west I wanted to try something differentThank you for your feedback and I will share this with the Food Beverage manager so that this is a single occurance. We hope to have another chance to serve you on your next trip to Key West!,1
"I had high hopes for this hotel. Yes, it is a 2 star but others give it a good rating. So I thoght this would be a good place to stay. When we first arrived at around 330 pm, the outside of the hotel was well kept so things looked promising. The lobby was clean and smelled nice. When I went to check in there was first a delay because the customer in front of me room was not ready. Then I found out my room wasn't ready. I was asked to leave my so they could call me when it was. They suggested I go drive around until then with gas prices so high. We came back at 5 pm and the room still wasn't ready. We sat in the hot car for another hour before they finally just offered us two single rooms instead of the queen double we prepaid for, stating they sold out of those rooms. We lost a whole day of our vacation simply b/c we weren't able to check-in until nearly 4 hours after the stated time. We didnt get to the beach until late so my kids only got tospend about an hour in the water. Check-out was no better. It was supposed to be at noon, but a male housekeeper came into my room at 1130 without knocking ready to turn the room over. Luckily I wasn't indisposed or anything. Then, the front desk tried to charge me a second time for the room. The room was nice, however. I would have considered staying thre again if those things didn't happen.",1

"This is not the best place to stay but, its clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The parking lot is small, the room are average, and because its far from the airport...no airport shuttle of course. The staff was great! Very helpful. The breakfast was good. Most importantly to me...the room was clean! I didn't have high... More",1
I really enjoyed my stay the bed was comfortable and All the staff was courteous. The pool area although small was just the right temperture and a really clean area. I felt safe and comfortable during my short stay.,1
I love this property. I give it a 5 star. It is my home away from home. The staff are so nice and the rooms are great. The staff works really hard to please the customers. The breakfast is delicious with lots of variety to choose from. I highly recommend it.,1
Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back.,1
So this isn't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. You can bring your pets in the room with you. It's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars (which has wonderful breakfasts). Try it out you won't be disappointed.,1
Great location close to the stadium but far enough away from the craziness. Nice staff and well maintained hotel. Love the free evening drinks and breakfast in the morning.,1
"Bad: One lonely and confused roach in the bathroom. Breakfast, but since we're Europeans this may be a matter of taste. Good: Spacious, comfortable rooms with air conditioning and dehumidifiers too. Nice reception area with a 24hrs possibility to buy toiletries, snacks, etc. Very close to the Disney parks and just next to a great Asian restaurant.",1
"Clean room , pleasant helpful staff. Very convenient location. Comfortable beds and free parking. Very good VFM for such a central location. If you decide to stay here then do not miss the Urth Cafe just along main Street.",1
I had stayed here for my girls night birthday celebration and I must say the room was very spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very pleasant and all the amenities we needed were right in this room. I will definitely be using this hotel in the future,1

"The facility was very clean and comfortable, but if you're traveling with a pet this might not be the place for you. There is a non refundable 30.00 pet fee and they don't even give you an old bathmat for a dog to sleep on. Lots of pet friendly facilities give you treats or even bowls for the animal to... More",1

"Price is good, service is good, cleanliness and comfort are average. Nice to have free breakfast even if it is simple fare.",1
"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!",1
Good: Loved location and decor.,1
Bad: Can't really say. Good: How convenient the Continental breakfast area is located,1

"We stayed here to see a show at Pechanga. The casino was about 20 minutes away. The hotel was freeway close. Everyone at this hotel was super friendly. The rooms were clean and the breakfast very good and fresh. Unfortunately, I did not get to use the pool but it was clean as well.",1

"I got a great deal on this place on Hotels.com for 81/night. Otherwise, I wouldn't have chanced it.

"Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom. Only thing missing was a shelf or stand for my suitcase. A lot of construction in the neighborhood but I heard nothing.",1
The ladies at the front desk were friendly and always helpful! We love Drury's free drinks and food! The room was nice! The pool did not seem very clean. Great location! Relight by ballpark village and the Arch. We walked to dinner and an ice cream place (about a half a mile). Overall we had a great experience. We would go back!,1
"Hotel confortavel, porem com algumas instalacoes antigas. No lobby e corredores muito bem arrumado, porem ao entrar no quarto sentimos um cheiro desagradavel. Me pareceu filtro do ar condicionado sujo. O banheiro estava limpo, assim como as toalhas e lencois. Em fim, para a regiao de washington, bom custo beneficio.",1
Good Hotel with reasonable rates. It was situated near highway 8. THe car noise was too much during the night and disturbed sleep. I will suggest other people to use this facility. Continental breakfast was fine in the AM,1
"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . .",1
Good: The breakfast was amazing and the comfort of the room was perfect.,1

"It's all about the budget! Sleep, shower and get out ! I don't have the heart to complain about all the amenities this place dose not have so I'll say instead that this property has had yet another refurbishing and a very good one. I appreciate that.",0
The hotel suited my purposes. Staff were helpful. Last 2 nights had no hot water. Sink light stopped working 5 days into trip. The price was good. Room was as clean as it could be. Had microscopic critturs coming from the sink electrical outlet. Overall liked the place. If you are looking for basic this this the place to stay.,1
"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out.",0

More",1
"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate.",0

This place is great! The service is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The free breakfast is delicious and on weekdays they have fresh baked cookies in the evenings. I come back anytime I'm in Ashland.,1
"Excellent value for the money. Great place to stay if you are skiing or biking in the Burke area. The room was less than half the cost of larger hotels and inns. The rooms are older and very simple, but clean and well kept. The staff was very friendly as well.",1
"The property is clean and well-maintained. The staff works hard to make you feel comfortable. The free breakfast is good, although it could use some more fruit.

"Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!",1

"We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.",1

"Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable.",1
Bad: Friendlier folks at the front desk...they are the first staff one interacts with at your hotel. They need to make eye contact and smile more. Interact with guests...make you feel welcome. Good: Housekeeping was awesome !!!,1
"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly.",0

It is located across from a shopping center with great restaurants and a movie theater...the beach was about 35-40 mins away which took me by surprise because under researched it...but I didn't seem to mind the drive. Overall I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.",1

"A trip to Oklahoma City wasnt really part of my vacation itinerary, but being from the neighboring state me and two of my friends decided to check out OKC anyway. For some reason we zeroed in on Bricktown Hotel, but boy, did we make the right decision! It was just awesome. We were kind of budget travelers, but we got more than we expected. The friendly staff and the great room facilities really impressed us, as did the great summer weather that greeted us whenever we went exploring the city. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. OKC really made us feel welcome, and Bricktown was just rocking. But were it not for Bricktown Hotel, I wonder whether wed have had such a marvelous time.",1

We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room).

I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!",1
This was a good last minute place to stay with a convenient location. Room was clean and quiet. Rate was reasonable and receptionist friendly. Easy access in and out of town before driving through Rocky Mountain park.,1
Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin.,1
Good: The hotel room was spacious and very comforting.....,1
"Hotel was in great and new condition, staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great too!",1
"Great friendly staff nothing to much trouble , always helpful and happy to advise best places to go and how to get there . Clean room with all you could need in it Fab location only 10 mins walk to beach and less than 5 mins to bars and shops Would love to return someday",1
Hotel was very close to the highway with noise and air conditioning not the greatest in the world.,1
"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager",1
"Upgraded to a beautiful suite, wonderful staff, and the best breakfast I've had in years!",1
It can be a little confusing to find in the dark without a GPS and the parking is poorly signed behind the hotel (not the place next to the hotel). At 6:45 am out took less than 10 mins to drive to the terminal. The hotel is very comfortable and the staff all pleasant and helpful. They do have some... More,1
"Pretty close to SF, about 30min and most important next to Rt 80. The best part of the trip was taking the ferry from Vallejo to SF which station is like 15min from the hotel and it helped us avoid traffic to the city. Very friendly staff, actually the girl at the lobby recommended me to take the ferry and... More",1
"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest.",1
We arrived early and we hadn't slept. Our room wasn't ready. They finally gave us a room just to sleep in until our room was ready. Thank You!!!! Staff was friendly. Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite.,1
"Good: The staff was incredibly accommodating! The pool was open 24 hours which was perfect for a late night dip after walking the strip! The view was gorgeous, and conveniently located near the strip.",1
Right in the heart of Down town and close to everything you need. One of the best hotels in the city and the prices were pretty reasonable too. I stayed here for my Honeymoon several years ago and it was such a fantastic place. We ate at the restraint on the top floor and the food was fantastic and the... More,1
"Staff was very helpful and responsive. The rooms, pool and parking were not as clean or good as usual embassy suites but in no means bad for the value.",1
"peeling lamp shades, broken off extra safety door lock. Other wise clean and sufficient for our need",1
Decided to stay at this hotel for convenience of walking to Cat Visitors Center and to the riverfront. My first thought when I walked into the front desk area was that this hotel appears to be a nice quit place to relax. Received a little attitude from the front desk person when checking into the hotel when I asked a... More,1
Bad: Nothing to really complain about. Good: Only 2 blocks from from Inner Harbor. Everything was in walking distance. Breakfast was great. Very clean. Front Desk people where very pleasant.,1
"Great location, friendly staff. Nice room. Breakfast OK. Wish the eggs were real instead of powdered. Suite was good for working. Shopping close by. Easy access to major highways. Highly recommend staying at this hotel.",1
"The kind of real coffee house which is surprisingly rare in the US. A cheery barista who clearly knew her business. Excellent capucinnos and lattes, and muffins. From the number of locals who came in this looks the place in Silverton for good coffee.",1
"Great hotel, nice pool and hot tub. Breakfast was great in the morning. The staff was helpful. The rooms were nice and big. The hotel is in a great location and is connected to a fun bar and grill. Definitely will return for more family fun!!!",1
The manager Robert and Nature were very courteous and professional. Great Breakfast and a reception is held on Wednesday night for guests. We were extremely pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay again. Entire staff was great.,1
"Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last.",1
This hotel was originally a livery back in the 1860s and it has all the character and charm a boutique hotel should have. A manager there told us the support beams and posts were from the original building- very cool. The rooms were large and designed with an antique flair and each room was attributed to a Florida governor so... More,1
"We walked in at midnight with no reservation after a stressful day and were so happy to be received by a very nice young women who completely took care of us. The room was nice with a lot of space, and everything looked brand new. Also the bed is crazy comfortable. I would def. stay here again.",1
"Repeat customer planning our next visit. Comfortable rooms, great food and accommodating hosts. Ken and Lisa are always helpful in suggesting additional exploring options in the area, such as a farmer's market or local artists.",1
"Friendly hotel staff (99) and a lot of food options with 5 mins or so. But the entire hotel smells musty and needs updating. Beds are HORRIBLE, 3rd shift front desk unpleasant/lazy, and with VA traffic you're more like 45 mins from the beach.",1
My experience here was pretty Awesome! The staff was very Helpful with whatever I needed and any questions I had about the area! I Would Recommend This place over and over! Very Happy with Staying here!!,1
We stayed on the second floor near the elevator. We loved our room and the location. They serve an excellent breakfast everyday and wine and cheese each afternoon. The courtyard is lovely place for breakfast and Indigo is within walking distance to historic Charleston. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Would definitely return.,1
"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",0
"We have stayed at the Maxwell Hotel twice now during our annual family trip to Seattle. What we love is the neighborhood feel for this hotel and that it is not super noisy. You are near the major sites and attractions, yet can walk to great restaurants and even grocery stores. The free parking is a bonus, as is the... More",1
Bad: 1. You have to walk through the casino to the rooms-- This is irritating. 2. Water took soooo long to get to the 15th floor. Waste of water to run it 7minutes to get it hot. 3. Very costly..... Especially for it's location and to the convention center. Simply outrageous for the value. Good: 1. Staff was great. 2. Room was clean 3. Decor was lovely. 4. Food was great.,1
The bed was comfortable. The room had a bad musty smell. Was not cleaned well. Happy that I only had to stay one night.,0
"We spent one night here (in the suite) and wished we had the time to stay longer. Had great vibes - super cool and clean - tons of personality. One of our best hotel experiences ever.

Great place for families. The rooms are spacious and in great shape. The pools are nice and offer variety for kids or adults. The beach was right there by the pools. We would spend hours at the pool then head to the beach and back to the pool. Family of five had plenty of room with the 2 bedroom. One... More,1
"Great view and amenities. Beautiful weather for our stay. Friendly staff and guests. Pismo Beach and surrounding areas are great places to visit. Overall, it was a very pleasant and relaxing vacation. We plan to return to the Sea Crest the next time we visit Pismo Beach.",1
"Bad: We loved everything, however they could have had longer breakfast times. Good: The bed was super comfy, the rooms were relatively soundproof - we could only hear when people walked by with large bags, the cleaning staff were great, 24/7 reception - very friendly, helpful. Pool was always clean and heated.",1

"Hotel Red is a stylish and comfortable hotel in Madison, right near campus. It is the nicest hotel in the area and has all the amenities. There is off street parking. I only had a short stay, but I found the room very quiet and comfortable.",1
"An excellent team to assist you. Opt for the valet parking. Nice rooms restaurant on site, front desk service available for your needs. Closest hotel to aquarium. Walking distance to Phillips arena. Well priced value for sure.",1
We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items.,1
Noise Excellent location,1
Perfect for our needs. Convenient to freeways for quick access to anywhere in the Norfolk and Virginia Beach area.,1
"The Element is a newer hotel with modern design, spacious rooms and friendly service. The lobby is open and inviting.

Clean hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Pool was great fun for the kiddos! Well lighted parking lot and nice looking grounds. Also had keyed entry's that all worked.

For the cost, we enjoyed the comfortable beds, the peaceful atmosphere, and the attentiveness and genuine enthusiasm of the owner. One nice aspect of this hotel is it's in the perfect location for doing things in K-Falls, and for quickly leaving town to... More",1
"I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list.",0
Rooms need new carpet. Was a little smaller than other Embassy Suites I have stayed in.,1
"This is a nice hotel, well placed for the business district and a short walk from Market Square. Good Gym and swimming pool, very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are a good size and well appointed. Would benefit from adding a safe to the rooms, a bit unusual that his is not provided these days.",1

I was on my own with my son and the staff recommended top places to visit, as well giving me suggestions in saving some money too.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. We had a wonderful time here and the memories we made are precious. There are not enough words to describe just how caring the people here at this hotel.

"Really liked this hotel. Check in was quick and easy. Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Beds were comfortable and pillows were really good. Cleaning staff was great. Pool was awesome! What a view! Breakfast was really good. Every morning there was a different egg type dish. Really good! Parking was good too.",1
"The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!",1
"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.",1

The price and conditions were fine. So was proximity to Kentucky Kingdom. OTOH we were there at Checki in time and had to WAIT for an available room.,1

"Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay.",1

Hotel was immaculately clean,staff friendly and courteous-Suzy on concierge was amazingly helpful. What would you expect from a lady from Derby,England Would definitely return.",1
I would stay again! Clean and comfortable. Breakfast ladies were super friendly and made sure everyone had what they wanted and were not rushed to clear everything off the shelves like some places are. Made us feel relaxed and welcome there. Thank you!,1
"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.",1
Always a pleasure to stay here . Great service . Clean rooms . Great down town location . Enjoy the early breakfast . Really enjoy the bacon . check in is speedy and pleasant - like the evening warm cookies and milk . Enjoy my 4:30 am news paper,1
"The room was very clean and neat and the continental breakfast was good. Our 1Am shuttle driver was very helpful, courteous and loved the music and chat. Could change the courtesy desk height-way to tall.",1
Bad: Ac wasnt working . Good: Clean,1
I travel 250-300 days a year. I've stayed in everything from The Four Seasons to Ritz Carltons to hovels in Pakistan with bullet holes in the walls. I once walked into a room in Maine that had a chalk outline of a murder victim still on the floor (Yeah. I checked right back out...) so I have no problem... More,1
Bad: Away from the strip . Good: Its a relaxing hotel ..,1
Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry.,1
I love Hilton properties and I always choose one if it is available. This is not the nicest one I've ever stayed in. The smell of cleaning products was a little too pronounced. Things were a little dingy. But the bed was as comfortable as ever and the room was nice.,1
Bad and slow WiFi connection,1
Had a very good dinner took my husband for his birthday dinner.had seafood raviolis and wings very good. Nice bar very lovely bartender.homecooked meals.,1
"As a last minute option, we decided to stop in Gatlinburg for the night while traveling. We saw the proximity of the hotel to where we wanted to be and it was a perfect option. We registered quickly and were on the way to enjoy our evening without delay.",1
I was really disappointed with the TV service. Very few channels and poor quality.,1
"Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds.",1
"It was not bad, my room was beside the pool and a lot if noise,short stay would be ok.",1
"Dirty room,uncomfortable beds, tv remote didnt work, no parking space",0
"Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time.",0
"This was an excellent hotel. Very clean and updated. Nice comfortable beds and covers. The complimentary breakfast had a huge selection and something for everyone. The only draw back was it was on the expensive side, but I guess you get what you pay for because I can't think of anything to complain about. Lol.",1
Bad: Our bathroom wasn't cleaned all that well. The kitchen had sticky spots. The walk to everything was kind of far for my family. Good: Friendly staff. Nice area near the lobby to sit.,1
"Loved this hotel. Charming, comfortable, impeccably clean, I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying downtown Charleston.",1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors.",1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Best Western Twin Islands. The room was comfortable and at a great location within Gatlinburg. I would have enjoyed more breakfast options like bagels or made already made oatmeal with additional add-ins.,1
Good: Very nice room and quite big. Nice ambience and cool bar plus helpful staff.,1
"So I stayed there last week. At first blush it seems pretty similar to all these business hotel chains. I checked in about 5 p.m. and they gave me a room at the end of a looong walk down the corridor. OK, maybe they are full. Then I step into the room, put my carry-on on the dresser, take off...

"I have stayed at this Microtel over 20 times in the last four years. I always stay there when I travel to Scranton and the surrounding area.

"Booked through online site and they got my name wrong over the phone but that wasn't the hotels fault. It wasn't the worst place I have stayed at all. A few problems though. The internet did not work in the room or the lobby on any of our devices, ipod, ipad, laptop, nothing. Did use the computer in the business center. They advertise a breakfast buffet in the lounge but it wasn't represented well with that title. Consisted of eggs, waffle (premade), cereal, toast so I was a little disappointed. The shuttle picked us up at the Metro 15 minutes late after I called twice. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the room was clean.",1
"Bad: To be honest there wasn't anything I did not like which is rare specially with two kids. Good: I loved the room it was spacious and beautiful, with hardwood floors and all the necessities needed to be able to cook if you wanted, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable, I would definitely stay here again",1

Wi fi worked great. The 24 hour... More",1
"We were passing through. After searching trip advisor reviews we chose this hotel because it is pet friendly and we had our tiny dog. The bed was comfy and room reasonably clean. Did not eat breakfast. Not much choice there.Thank you for staying with us! We appreciate your comments and look forward to your next stay. Be sure to follow us on our facebook page, Days Inn of Ellis.",1
"The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!",1
"Came to visit Miami with friends relatively last minute. Flew in FLL. Very packed weekend w/ the Ultra Music fest Spring Break going on. Stayed in Hollywood for a recent visit in 2015 (Comfort Suites one exit back) so I did not mind the commute to Miami, especially cause I have a rental car. This hotel was very convenient...right...

"We stayed one night after a full day of touring and driving. The staff were friendly and the room was clean - though a bit dated and in need of some service (a lamp was burned out). The breakfast was very tasty and the fella who was stocking was very attentive and helpful. Overall, a good stay.",1
"Great, night sleep on nice, clean King size bed. Nice comfortable pillows! Room was large and very clean. Front desk staff was friendly. Free shuttle to/from National airport and to/from a nearby Metro station and complimentary, fresh breakfast buffet is a nice plus! Highly recommend this hotel.",1
"Good: Perfect Location, friendly staff, amazing rooms.",1
"Our visit to this hotel was just wonderful! It started with the cheerful greeting from the front desk clerk in the small and comfortable lobby.

"Our room was clean, comfortable, and large. It had a fridge and microwave.

They offered Udi's gluten free bagels, however, they do not have a... More",1
"Hotel is clean, staff is friendly. Breakfast may be a hit or miss, guess depends on who is preparing the food. Depending on where your room is located you can end up with considerable noise from the traffic on 1604. Third stay at this hotel, two good stays and last one is so so. Believe they changed management recently as... More",1
"I chose this hotel from Hotwire for a three night stay before a cruise. I was travelling with my wife, daughter, and two grandsons. This is a beautiful, clean hotel. There is a pool on the property that is a good size, and then just behind the hotel is the beach with a life guard stand very close by. Towels... More",1
"You cannot beat this hotel for the price and location in Allentown. It also allows dogs which for me is fantastic. The rooms have always been spotless and the staff is always friendly. Although this time I had a minor problem with the rate, the manager corrected the problem immediately when he was made aware of the problem. You can... More",1
"I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.",0
Excellent,1
"It's my own fault for not checking more closely, but I didn't realize the rooms opened to the outside. I thought they were on indoor corridors. So I was disappointed. However, the price was right and we needed to be near the airport for an early morning flight. We heard a few planes fly over, but nothing that kept us... More",1
we had a unknown visitor come into our room at 4:30am. it was strange. how she got in is unknown but when she tryed to get in bed with us my wife escorted her out of our room. very weird experience indeed.,1

"The hotel was very comfortable. I was there for one night, and chose it for the location. The staff was very nice and welcoming, the bed was super-comfortable, and I melted right into it.

"Bad: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay. Sheridan was very accommodating, a tad expensive, but stayed because other family members were there. Very clean. Doesn't have curb appeal, but the inside looks up to date and modern. Went to the hotel bar for a drink and some apps - Sauvignon Blanc didn't taste like sauvignon blanc, cheese platter had more meats than cheese, meatballs were rubbery, waitress was very nice. Breakfast at the same place was great. Easy check out. Good: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay.

"Be prepared for your stay here. We found a Safeway grocers nearby and that made the stay a lot better for our dietary needs. The hotel was well run, but NO ELEVATOR. They even had a waffle maker for breakfast, full choices of on the go breakfast items. The staff were really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. But remember - NO ELEVATOR.",1
"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away.",1
"We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well.",1
Air conditioner didnt work. Toilet was filthy (urine). Service elevator overheated and set off fire alarm. Was repeatedly warned by staff about it being a high crime neighborhood.,0
We really enjoyed our week! The beach does have erosion but still so beautiful. Our unit was in building 6. We loved the pool and staff was super friendly. We used the complimentary bikes one day and liked them a lot. Loads of food options. Only drawback was that they've implemented some sort of room temperature control so you can't... More,1

Bad: Was told I would get a robe and didn't.,1

This was a stop over on a cross country driving trip. We had high hopes for this place and were hoping we would like it enough to stay two nights. One night was more than enough.

"The room we stayed in was mostly renovated and clean and really not too bad for a hotel that accepts dogs for 10 per night.

Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.,1
"Hyatt Places are consistently guest friendly, offer the amenities that appeal to both the pleasure and business traveler, and are our preferred hotel when traveling. We always find the breakfast handy and offering a variety of food options, and most of the hotels offer a small bar with adult beverages, perfect for a nightcap.",1
"Good: Location is great, 15 min away from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Airport. Breakfast was good, there is free parking and wifi as well as amazing small pool for refreshing. I would highly recommend this hotel, good value",1
"Great hotel nothing spectacular, the price is right, but the location was awesome. Right in the middle walking distance from everything!!",1
I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel was clean inside and out. There was always fresh cookie at the front desk along with a smile on the stuff person no matter who the person was behind the counter.,1

Bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Breakfast was a bit hap-hazard in that the line was incredibly long to obtain a made-to-order omelette. Nice provisions for the breakfast. Set up was good. Food was better than I expected and they offered healthy choices for breakfast including yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal. I would stay again. I felt safe and the place was maintained well.",1
Loved the breakfast!!,1
Mold in tub!,1
"This was a great hotel, great location!!! Check-in was quick, check-out was even faster! The room was just as pictured, beautiful ocean view from the balcony. The one and only issue we had was no hot water on two occasions. We will definitely stay again when we return to Virginia Beach!!!",1

Well the hotel is good as usual for the group.

Room service (cleaning) was not done one day. I had to request room claening,1
Bad: We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter. When my dad didn't understand what he was asking he gave him such an attitude. Everything else was perfect except for that encounter.,1
My experience here was Ok. The staff was very welcoming and professional. The hotel is a bit dated. My bathroom was very small. in fact the bathroom was pretty lame....Given the price I will likely look elsewhere next time.,1

Mark also has maps and pamphlets for guests that want to see the wonderful sites of New Hampshire. I would definitely return next year.",1
Bad: Scam more charge of parking and take from my credit card without telling me . Good: Location,0
"Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean.",1
Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!,1
"We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!",0
Everything was great. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and made you feel comfortable. Would recommend to anyone and would stay here again when I am in the area.,1

"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM",0

"This is a good hotel for business purposes. The wi fi signal is good and it is very close to the federal reserve bank. A little too close to some of Chicago's high crime district for my taste, but we felt relatively safe. Convenient to restaurants, and decent breakfast. A solid business option.Dear Samantha HThank you for your review.I would like to reassure you that The Central Loop area of Chicago which is, as you know, also the Financial District of the City is not near any major crime area. The area is safe and very well patrolled by the Chicago Police so please do not have any concerns.I am glad you had a good stay with us and look forward to you return.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager",1

Nice hotel in SLO. staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in. Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side. But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great.,1
Highly recommend this hotel for the proximity to downtown Atlanta. Excellent room with very good daily service. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. Not something you find in lower quality hotels.,1
"Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid.",1

"Front desk reception staff very welcoming. Lobby comfortable and inviting . Room was dark and damp . Bathroom had mold in corners, needs a good scrubbing with bleach. Laminate floor needs cleaning, it was scuff marked and had nail polish drops on it. Breakfast bad, dried out biscuits ,no jam or peanut butter for toast, no yogurt.",0
"It's a Microtel and it's close to the freeway, but it is very well run and the freeway gives great access to pretty much anything in the Scranton area, The rooms are compact but not cramped and they are well decorated and our room had a cute window seat area. The manager is unbelievably helpful and went out of his... More",1
"Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland",1
"We were able to check in at 10 AM. This early check in was great for us. We had sometime to get rest after long drive and could park our car and took off to the museums by subway which was about 10 minutes walk with the kids. Also, they serve us breakfast and some drinks at dinner time.",1
"I lost my confirmation number and they couldn't find my reservation, but they gave me a room I booked at the price I was quoted at. Breakfast was good and restaurant area was clean. Housekeeping was great and on cue. Came back to a clean room and fresh towels every day.",1
"It was so dark and deserted looking when we drove up we thought it was closed up. I booked online and they couldn't find my reservation. I should have walked away but it was 1:30am, we had been to a concert and there were no rooms in Milwaukee due to Summerfest. The room was so dirty we left our shoes... More",0
"Truly a magnificent hotel. Beautiful, spacious rooms massive bathrooms. Not anywhere near the strip, but if you are a hiker/climber, this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon/Spring Mountain Recreation areas. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stay away from the tight slots though.",1
"Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up.",1
This was our first trip to Hawaii and we spend several months planning. It will be easier next time because we plan to come back to this resort on our next trip. No complaints whatsoever. We were fortunate to arrive shortly after the main pool reopened. I can imagine that would have put a serious crimp on things. With all... More,1
"We stayed here during a business trip to the tri-cities area. The hotel is well located and very new feeling. The room was spotless and the staff was helpful. My room had a nice small balcony that overlooked a marina which gave this otherwise very standard business hotel an almost resort feel, which was a nice break from the otherwise... More",1
"The hotel looks very high class without breaking the budget. Staff are very friendly and have kind attitudes towards guests. They are very accommodating and are a pleasure to be around. The rooms are very nice and clean, not a spot on them. The personal touch of the cleaner was a welcome reminder that the staff are more than just... More",1
As usual Hampton Inn is good and doing everything to make your stay a good experience Good overall experience Breakfast is always a strongest point of any Hampton Inn Location is the best for people looking to eat around because it is located in industrial -office type complex Close to I-95,1
We stayed here to go to the Legoland Discovery Center. The hotel provides free transportation to Phipps Plaza and complimentary breakfast so that was great. I would recommend this hotel for families. It's clean and the staff is amazing.,1
"Facility was in good shape and clean. A little awkward to get to. NO ELEVATOR! The room was spacious. Having said that some of that space should have been invested in the bathroom. The sink is outside the bath, next to the door. Once in the bath you need to stand between the toilet and tub to shut the door!... More",1
Another sub-par breakfast menu Jacuzzi was Very Nice.,1
We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.,0
Just a stop over on way from south Fla. To Myrtle Beach. Love Savannah and this hotel.,1
"bonne impression en general, personnel courtois et polis.Point a ameliorer: eclairage des chambres qui est faible la nuit.",1
"Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!",1
"Amazing experience for our kids and parents who stayed. They hours of amenities were perfect and very well laid out. It seemed that no one was left wanting for anything.

"I stayed at the Wingate in Erie, PA this past weekend. Everything was great, the staff was friendly, the hotel was clean, beds and pillows were comfy, breakfast was yummy. I would highly recommend this hotel.",1
Entire staff was both accommodating and extreemly pleasant. Room was very clean and quiet. I recommend this hotel and plan to stay there when I visit Atlanta later in the new year. The only thing that could be improve upon is to serve a full breakfast buffet YUM!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. It is pleasing to know you were well accommodated by our staff and that you would recommend our hotel. Thank you again for your review. It would be our pleasure for you to repeat your experience with us in the future.,1
"Services were good, room clean. Good location. We visited universal studios and used a rental car. The drive was around 15-20 minutes. Hotel very close to all amenities. If needed will definitely stay again.",1
"The hotel is exactly what it needs to be for Port Aransas-- conveniently located (10 minutes walk from the beach), affordable (we booked a large room with a mini fridge, king size bed etc for 39 per night during the off season), and the owners are attentive, informative and incredibly friendly. There is also a lovely cafe across the street... More",1
"We stayed here for five nights while looking at properties outside Tallahassee. For the price we paid through Hotels.com, 47 a night, it was a no brainer. It was clean, a free hot breakfast every morning, staff was courteous, and on our downtime one day, we had the whole, well kept pool, all to ourselves for 2 hours.",1
The hotel was just okay. They are under construction and the location has quite a bit of road noise. The room I was in had and older bed and the bathroom could have used some updating. One good thing was the bathroom was clean.,1
Bad: Staff were not particularly knowledgeable about the charges applied to the bill. Desk staff indifferent to customers.,1
"The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding.",1
"Bad: Construction next door. Good: Big front porch, short walk to beach",1
"Bad: Every now and again, we could hear bass from another room. However, it was never during sleeping hours so that was positive. Good: Everyone was super friendly and helpful. All staff were very accommodating and friendly. The rooms (especially their view) were very nice. The rain shower was a definite plus as well.",1
The facilities and staff made our wedding weekend a success! Rooms were great! Refrigerators a blessing. Breakfast very good. Staff very accommodating and service driven.

The hotel is almost completely renovated. All rooms have bay view and no smoking. Room was comfortable with separate seating area and table/chairs. Like the idea of going green by requesting that visitors opt not to have sheets/towels changed everday. Will definitely return.,1
"I really enjoyed my stay here for one night. The room was large and very comfortable, with a kitchenette (fridge, coffee machine, microwave, sink), desk and living room. The staff was pleasant and provided a shuttle to and from the airport if needed. Ample parking space. Breakfast was included and had plenty to choose from and lots of seating.",1
Bad: The room lacked hanging space and was quite small. Good: The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant were nice,1

"The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!",1
"I stayed here on a work trip for 8 nights. My room was clean, breakfast was nice, staff was friendly! I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I also like the fact, that it's off of the busy street. But it only walking distance to the beach. They also do valet services which is nice.",1
"Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order.",1
Traveled there a few weeks back for my 35th birthday and my stay at Aria was nothing short of AMAZING! Will definitely stay there again. From the staff to the food at the buffet and the cafe to the night life. One of the best stays I've had in Vegas!!,1
I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week.,1
Bad: The only issue I had was there not being a microwave/refrigerator in the room. Good: Room was clean. It wasn't as crowded as the other well known hotel casinos. The staff was friendly and helpful.,1
"Great location walking distance close to all down town ....bathroom too small, the rest was ok. The restaurant was not working so we had to go to other places around for meals.... People were vey nice",1
"I was very satisfied with the facility. To be honest not all hotels are the best, but my experience staying here at Best Western was great. Nice clean, big rooms, they have everything you need, friendly staff, etc. A very well equipped Hotel. I would stay here again, our home away from home.",1
They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people.,0
"I stayed here one night because downtown hotels don't shuttle to the airport. I was surprised to find a new, clean, modern hotel. Nothing fancy, but there was a bar. I didn't use any amenities but I thought it was a bargain with a free shuttle and right next to the airport.",1
"Bad: The last night there was a prom. I guess one of the parties decided to continue in to the night next door. Loud talking and slamming of the doors,up until 3 am. The desk knew about it when I called but nothing was done. I will never stay there again, paying so much and living like a Days Inn. All the desk could say was they were sorry. Good: The staff and extras were good. The room was nice and view was good. Comfortable room. Loved the crabby evening activities.",1
"We had to quickly find a hotel late at night, after coming to town for a family emergency. Super 8 had room, and so we went ahead and got a room there. The woman at the front desk gave us our key and told us the room number. The exterior of the hotel isn't the best, but I wasn't too... More",0
"This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water...

"The hotel is located on an excellent and very convenient block. Very close to the action, but about a block away from the action at the same time. So perfect for walking back from bourbon street without problems and close enough to walk to where you need to go in French Quarter. The hotel lobby doorman is a nice upscale... More",1
"I was concerned about the location, because of the reviews, but it is a nice area. Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's.",1
"During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming.",1
"Traveled with my family for the 5A state championship in Hillsboro, but found almost all of the hotels in the area were full.

"Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open.",0
"This hotel is in a good location close to the Seattle Centre.

"Check in was fantastic! The rooms were clean. They have a fantastic pool for kids, which was great since we have a two year old. It was close to most of the major attractions. They had a variety of breakfast items to choose from. We will definitely stay again!",1
This is a very nice hotel in a great downtown location. Accessible to all the attractions and very accommodating. I found it comfortable and clean. I like the complimentary drinks at the door and friendly staff. Our family really felt welcome and enjoyed this hotel the rooms were very relaxing.,1
My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn.,1
"Very nice boutique hotel in downtown Long Beach simple, Euro-style. easy walking distance to Pine Ave and other downtown amenities, easy parking, very nice, simple continental breakfast. I really enjoyed my stay and will be back.",1

"2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep.",0

Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub.",0

Don't expect a resort property like so many on this beautiful island. This properties charm is the historic nature and ideal location for an active traveler. Want to island hop the ferry is at your front door. The 4 happy hour Mai Tai's are very good.,1
I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.,0
"The rooms are all decorated differently and are very quaint, with a personal touch. One of the cleanest rooms we have ever stayed in. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.

From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!,1

"My room or hallway didnt smell funny, the staff was friendly helpful, and there wasn't any loud noises or unruly guests. I had hotwater and the heater worked. As far as the room itself, you get what you pay for..No hangers, old furniture poor tv reception/wifi. The bed was comfortable enough. If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works. Things that made me giggle: the phone in the room was from the Marriot in another state, the sheet that had the list of tv channels had a different hotel name on it, the advertisement for a pizza place that will deliver to your room has relocated and no longer does the keycard does not have the Inn's name on it but does have another pizza advertisement (different place) all over it again says they will deliver to your room, ya, no its out of the area.",1
"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.",1

"Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy",0

The hotel was easy to find, and had an onsite parking garage (a little pricey, but it's pretty on par with other places in the city, and I liked that it was on site and underground).

"I was traveling in February 2015, was tired and stopped at this terrible place. The front desk lady was very kind and quite understanding when I requested my money back. The room was full of roaches, E V E R Y W H E R E! Left running, kept driving.",0
Bad: Thermostat was hard to manage. Dining area was ok. Lots of outside options though so that was just a small thing. Good: Location and quality of room,1
"The hotel has seen better days. The room was adequate and clean, but nothing to rave about. The indoor pool was very cold despite being heated. My son and I could only stay in for about 20 minutes. We were on the 6th floor and it had a peculiar smell in the hallways that suggested they might be renovating on that floor...it was that chemical smell...of new carpet or glue...not sure. Our room service dishes stayed in the hallway one full day and night after we finished with them.... Overall...probably won't go back, it was just so-so",1
"Very well priced hotel convenient to major highways while being in a very pleasant suburb in the Summit/Chatham/Morristown area. Direct train service to NYC. Decor is dated but it's clean and safe.

Location is perfect. We have stayed 5 to 6 times and always had a nice stay. Room is always clean. It is quiet and clean hallways. The staff does a good job of keeping the lobby and breakfast area very clean.,1
"We loved the pink hotel and will definitely be going back! It was clean, well furnished and the bed and bedding was heavenly!! Crisp white sheets with billowy comfort.

"My experience with Best Western has been very good. I like their chain especially in their newer facilities. I typically seek out this chain as well as Hampton and other high end chains.

"We wanted a hotel that would allow us to visit the delta river, go to the wineries and visit the fair. This hotel was a great place to do do it all.

Could hear everything from above, including walking, and dogs barking....yes..they allow animals. And when people let their door slam it shook the whole room. It happened often. The bed was very hard, and when I turned the fan/heat on it blew the curtain out and away from the window limiting privacy.",1
No1 stay very comfortable. Please change pillows made sleeping very hard.,1
"I've stayed at plenty of budget hotels. I've always said, I don't care if the furniture is run down, the decor is outdated, etc., as long as it is clean.

Wine and cheese was available in the lobby in the late afternoon. The rooms were spacious, and had all the amenities. Though not new, they were... More",1
"The staff was very nice and accommodating. Love the happy hour and breakfast option. The outside area is nice. Lobby good. Rooms just a little cheapish, but ok. Bed comfortable. Bedding clean. Like the coffee and cookies in the lobby.",1
"Overall our stay was ok, Staff was not helpful when checking in. One attendant said she will help you in a minute after she gets off phone. Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning. Hotel is right behind a questionable restaraunt. We did not have any issues though, just a feeling of concern,",1
"Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"I had a pleasant stay here while I was visiting family for Thanksgiving. The front desk service is what won me over more than the room. I think her same was Sheree, was absolutely the most helpful. She pointed me in the direction of great night spots and wonderful restaurants. Thanks to her I almost forgot about Thanksgiving food!",1
Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday.,0
Seriously security is too bed!! Some one stole my stuff in my car!!,0
"Checked out a day and a half early due to bed bugs. No other vacancies there, but I don't think I would accept another room there anyway.",0
"We stayed here for 2 nights because the price was reasonable and the amenities looked pretty impressive...it did not disappoint. Check in was easy, everyone was friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The heated pool was crowded but very fun. We did not eat in any of the on-site restaurants, but we did get smores at the cabana bar... More",1
Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.,0
I had an amazing time. The hotel is close to all the tourist spots. The hotel has free shuttle service to and from the hotel and to the metro station. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of bed. The free breakfast was amazing!,1
"I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed.",0
"Bad: Very old hotel. Front desk not very pleasant, never smiled! Isn't that their job description Happily welcome guests as the hotel ambassadors. They just talked amongst themselves. Breakfast was obviously cheap unfrozen. Nothing FRESH, except old fruit overly-processed waffle mix. Tub was gross towels had hair stuck to it. Very small front desk/common/breakfast area, pictures are decieving. Good: Location was amazing, next to easiest Magic Kingdom entrance! Room was clean enough. Choice hotels update done, TVs, bedspreads... The building is very pretty, not cookie cutter. We didn't use pool, gym nor office but pictures looked okay.",1
Stay was overall wonderful. Bathrooms could use a little maintenance. We would stay here again. This was an affordable convenient option when you cannot afford to stay waterfront.,1
I had great customer service at this hotel. I mistakenly clicked the book button twice and accidentally reserved two rooms. When I explained the situation to the manager he allowed me to only pay for one room even though they were booked up and as I arrived late at night they could not sell the other room they had waiting...

This Best Western motel served the best breakfast I've ever had in a motel. They are centrally located in town and is close to adjoining restaurants. The staff was knowledgeable and anxious to please.,1
"Great hotel in the heart of Union Square at a very reasonable rate. We were attending an event at ATT park and Earlier that day we devided to stay in the SF overnight. The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!",1
"Bad: Nothing really. Good: Excellent staff, comfort and amenities.",1
"A typical Hampton Inn. Two issues, however. Located at an exit that has no town around it...just 2 other motels restaurants, gas, etc. 1or 2 exits.

The room was great and the lady at the front desk very helpful and nice. Only main complaint was that it was very warm in the lobby area. Couldn't really relax because it was so much more warmer then the other floors.,1

Stopped in at this casino on the way back from Birchrun MI shopping. Not to fond of trying to find our way in and the area. But all went well. Found the money wen quick so the visit was not long. Did not hear a lot of winners going off. Could of been just the Sunday we were there.,1

The staff was very helpful. The room was comfortable but not clean enough. The rest of the hotel was also lacking.,1
"NYLO was such a fun experience. The entire place feels like you are in NYC. The rooms are clean, modern, and resemble a loft. NYLO is tucked quietly away within a short distance from the shops at legacy and tons of restaurants. When I'm in the area again I will be staying here. Super friendly staff as well.",1
Good: Great location and rooms are comfortable and clean,1
"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!",1
"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.",0
"Nothing fancy, just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to Ohio.",1
"Decent hotel to stay, fairly close to DC, close to the Beltway",1

Only spent 1 night here. Clean and spacious rooms. Good varied breakfast included. Bed was very comfortable. Would recommend this motel for short stays. Free parking. San Luis Obispo itself is a very nice town!,1
Awesome !!!!!! I will come back !,1
"In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation.

"Bad: The room was not clean. The toilet flooded and wet the room's carpet. I requested another room which was cleaner, but the bathtub was clogged!. Good: Location and staff",1
"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience.

Bad: Happy hour prices to expensive. Good: Locatation,1
"When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa.",1

Everything was fine for a per-cruise hotel. There were a couple of places nearby to eat (Miller's Ale house I believe) and the hotel I think arranges for transport to the cruise ships.

"Very friendly, helpful staff. The facility, however, is somewhat run-down and in need of maintenance. Location and value are a plus but was disappointed in quality of rooms and that the pool was under construction.",1
"I have to say that I was scare at first that my reservation was going to be denied, because there was many people with that problem before me. But when it was my turn, everything went well and actually because the hotel was full, they gave a better room for the same price. I was happy because it was comfortable and we had a great night of sleep after a very busy day.",1
Our vehicle broke down while passing Dillon Mt. so we were forced to stay while repairs were being made.

Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!",1
"Bad: Sofa bed very uncomfortable. Good: Great restoration of classic building close to sports, shopping and financial district.",1
"This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)",0
Room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a plus and good. Close to highways (only 20 minutes from DC attractions. Nearby to shopping and local restaurants. The Silver Diner nearby was excellent.,1
I had a fabulous stay. We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was fabulous. I would stay again. The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a microwave. I love the bathroom and the view was on the strip so it made it beautiful.,1
"This is San Francisco in Silicon Valley, so when a hotel charges over 15 per night for internet access you expect a decent connection. Not that I needed to watch movies or do anything particularly heavy - but for work purposes the internet connection was often simply unacceptable. Despite that, the staff were extremely friendly, the room and hotel in... More",1
"As a whole experience was good, would stay again, but in a room that was not so close to general hotel activities. staff friendly and pleasant. No bath mat and soap in bathroom doing second day of stay.",1
"Neptune hotel is in perfect location and the best view. You have access to a pool,breakfast,and computer for your needs. The staff had an answer and solution for everything we needed. We would like to visit again!",1
"Bad: The unesessary complaints regarding noise level which included laughter in the court yard as not above he constant noise level of the street. Good: Unfortunately, the occupants are a mixture of residents and vacationers. Not a good mix for individuals wanting to enjoy their vacation as residents will complain if you are too loud.",1
"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!",1
"Reception ok nothing to write home about Decor basic Wifi good given the basic hotel Beds good, ok sleep given time difference, given jet lag Noisy shower Noisy a/c Breakfast excellent compared to everything else Overall great given the cost of staying",1
I like it,1
Our trip was for business. We found the staff to be very helpful. We would stay there again.,1
"Loved this hotel so much we decided to stay an extra night. Customer service was on point, and the area was quiet regardless of how many family's were there.",1
Good: Excellent location and good price for money. Rooms were big and clean and staff was friendly and professional .,1
One of the girls at check-in had zero personality. actually she was draining. Outside my view room was the obstruction of a white wood gazebo. I don't understand this to be a view. The room service selection price and quality was excellent!,1
Looks old from the outside but not bad on the inside. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. Baily's the restaurant was nice looking but understaffed at the time. The night shift lady messed up our room reservation but was quick to correct the mistake. The afternoon ladies were unpleasant and not quick to help. Not a bad stay if you don't need much help from the front desk.,1
"It was overbearingly awful. The humidity and the foul mold odor was over our heads. Thank God we only stayed one night, but seriously this hotel either needs a demolition or remodeling.",0
"Room was clean and the service was very good, the continental breakfast with a lot of stuff to choose. Good hotel for the price, only one think I see they need a bigger garbage cans in the room for families with small kids.",1
Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room. Beds are comfortable and the room is rather spacious. I also like the amenities. The location is also good - Bart station is round the corner and the shopping area is just next door.,1
"I really like this hotel -- friendly, inviting staff upon arrival, vibrant lobby and bar, and large clean rooms.It is close to the airport and within walking distance of many fine dining opportunities. It is also a short run or walk to the waterfront (about 0.6 miles) and lots of new fitness, shopping, dining, and beautiful pier-side panoramas await those... More",1
The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.,1
"Perfect location. Very nice rooms. Great included breakfast. Very helpful, competent, and friendly staff. Will visit again.",1
"I read so many scathing reviews on this hotel, that I only booked one night when I needed three. Once I saw the room and the view, I quickly booked the other two nights. Seriously people, what do you freaking expect for 50 - AAA rate for an ocean view king I know of an RV park down the road... More",1
"Ok, I know it's San Diego, Hotel Circle, but this hotel makes you feel like you're on an island somewhere far away. The landscaping is lush and almost tropical. It's far larger than it looks from the street. The rooms are a bit small, but they're still confortable with all the amenities except microwave...but I didn't miss that. And I... More",1
"I stay often for work, maybe once every other month every time I have stayed the staff is always so nice and the whole hotel and room is very clean. During the holidays they had their lobby decorated really nice and it felt very inviting. They also have a nice breakfast in the morning which is a nice when you... More",1
Just feels old. The parking deck is awful if you drive a truck that is equipped with a taller lift than standard. Check in and Check out is a little crazy and long lined but the rooms are nice and clean. Food is good... little cafe has many options.,1
"The best place to stay in Pleasanton! A welcoming place, breakfast buffet offered, If staying weekdays dinner buffet is offered. Happy hour is great. Nice menu to choose from to order in room. Pool and spa to enjoy along with a nice fire pit to read a book and relax by. Highly recommend!",1
"My boyfriend and I decided to take a last minute Trip to Virginia Beach, and spotted the Magnuson right when we got off the exit. We were exhausted and decided to stop by and check out the rates.

The Hotel Laguna has location -- on the beach and in downtown Laguna. That's about all it has the facility is very tired and in need of a complete renovation. It does not provide the level of service that I expect of a hotel that charges what it does. Among the many annoying features are paper thin walls that leave... More,0
"Excellent stay! Clean, spacious, handicapped accessible king suite. Friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast feast! A home away from home! My only regret is we only stayed one night. I had such an enjoyable stay, I will be making reservations today for the 2016 games!!!",1
"Everyone was so friendly, the breakfast buffet was great, not your average free breakfast! Will most defiantly be staying there when I return in June. There was nothing to complain about at all, and I am pretty sure if you had a complaint it would be fixed ASAP!!",1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great breakfast with lots of options! Overall 10 out of 10. Nice pool and work out area. Clean rooms and hotel with nice updated design. That's all I have to say.Thank you for your good review and we hope to be hosting you again soon here at the Hampton Inn Knoxville/Clinton I-75.,1
"I was traveling on business and stayed a couple days in June, 2015. A breakfast is included. The main street of Independence is within walking distance and there are several local eateries nearby, as well as a locally owned, fully stocked scrapbook store with Saturday hours and several antique shops. On Saturday morning I visited a farmers market about a... More",1
Had to pay up front and had a misunderstanding that we couldn't split Bill and we were going to lose our room next night! Got someone else at front desk who figured it out!! Phew!! All the amenities! Great location!,1
"It was amazing experience at Hyatt Recency it's really really beautiful room all the stuff were so clean. We took the 27th floor it has a gergouse view from it, we spent 4nights we really enjoyed when I go to Orlando again I'm pretty sure to make a reservation at the hotel",1
Stayed 5 nights at this property. Clean and well maintained property. Front desk staff were very polite and courteous . My room rate included breakfast. (not a buffet) On the second day when I stopped by at the breakfast bar and ordered a cappuccino. I was told You are not allowed Cappuccino I was obviously embarrassed hearing the... More,1
"We were within walking distance to the town, shops, and restaurants. The bed had the same beautiful linens as Congress Hall. The trolley ride through the decorated town was fun.",1
"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons.",1
Older hotel in dire need of updating. I expected to see Austin Powers come out of the bathroom.,0
"What a cool hotel! Super friendly, helpful and thorough check in and up to a super cool room!The views are amazing, the location couldnt be better! Youre ten-fifteen minutes from all the sights! Check out the view from my room!!Awesome! My favourite hotel by a long way.Dont stay somewhere average, dont stay somewhere boring stay here and feel the coolness permeate to you!Good work guys! Good workMartin, Have to say, this is my favourite review of the day!! Your don't stay somewhere average... line is classic. Perhaps you should be our new pitchman! Thanks for the recognition of the good work, a lot goes into getting this right from the brand, to the design and of course the most important part the staff! Thanks for staying here and hope to have you back soon! Evan",1
I traveled to Vegas the week of June 28-July 1 with my husband on business and we stayed at the ARIA. This place is AMAZING!!!!

"This was a good choice. It was on the edge of the plaza so we were able to walk. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate and well appointed. Though we only took advantage of the complimentary breakfast one morning, it was very good. We will use this hotel again when we go back this spring.",1
Bad: none.,0
"Horrible, the beds were like bricks and lacked comfort.",0
We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful. Then when checking out holiday Inn charged us an additional fee.,0
"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!",1
Pleasant room with small bathroom and closet. Clean (air freshener a little strong at first) with comfortable beds. A/C worked fine. Fridge Microwave were useful. Staff friendly and helpful. All in all very good value stopover with easy access to the freeway.,1
"Excellent staff, easy to access of Interstate, big rooms, separate sink/tub area, very comfortable beds, convenient store nearby. We were traveling with our dogs as we're currently relocating, and there were several convenient areas to walk them.",1
"We stayed here to attend Kentucky Derby and spent little time in the hotel. The pool was closed for repairs. Friendly staff and conveniently located next to highway. It seems everybody in town smokes, so lots of people hanging around entrance puffing away.",1
This location is as good or better than the average Hampton Inn. Food is great. Room is great but doesn't have a fridge. The only negative is if you have a large vehicle due to the (free) parking garage on the property.,1
"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner. This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater.",1
Enjoyed the stay at this Best Western in Redmond. Hotel prices were a little cheaper than the hotels in Bend which is only 15 minutes away. There are some nice walking areas in town and the hotel staff was very helpful in showing where they are on a map. One word of advice is that the second Saturday in July... More,1

Location - great, a short walk to the Bar Harbor shops, restaurants and village green bus stops (The Island... More",1
"Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great, everyone was very friendly. The room itself was okay. Nothing very exciting, but it had what we needed. It felt a bit worn out. There was a crack in the shower wall. The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn. The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though. The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony.",1
"Absolutely the worse motel/hotel we had ever stayed in. No elevator. Steep unkept stairs. First impression upon entering, was very poor. Walls dirty, light switches dirty, dirty torn lampshades with mold in neighboring room. Sheets appeared clean. Bathroom the worse. Bathmat appeared dirty, when lifted it was mold from the underside. Floor, wall, corners, ceiling all needed cleaned and renewed.... More",0
What a lovely old hotel with so much character. The rooms are small but the Lanai's are really big. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean with lots of hot water. This hotel is central to everything in Lahaina. The free parking and wifi are a bonus. Yes the air conditioners are noisy but we were so tired from... More,1
My grandson was locked in the bathroom for 45 minutes due to faulty bathroom door locks. Hotel staff had no idea on how to get him out. My husband figured out what the problem was with the door and got him out. Now my grandson never wants to stay in any hotel ever again!!! Traumatic experience!!,0
"Great place for an extended stay! Enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, and everything around the city there in Port Arthur. Enjoyed the fact that I could use the kitchenette with the room when not wanting to go out to eat all the time when I stayed for a few days. Will definitely stay again when traveling through the area.",1
"Room was large and had a balcony facing towards the beach. It was a bit dated but kept in very good condition. Location is great, just one block from the boardwalk.",1
"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",0
The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot.,1
This is my first review on TA which should tell you we were very happy with our experience. Value for money in the heart of prime time vacation season was excellent. Every single person was extremely friendly. Not a fancy place however that is not what they are shooting for. They are a very nice vacation motel with good sized... More,1
"Excellent little hotel in a wonderful location with corteous and helpful staff in a very well kept facility. Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it. Rita, a member of the staff, was particularly helpful.",1
I found this hotel very clean. Helpful staff and friendly. Very satisfied with stay and will stay again when in area. Breakfast staff was very friendly and food was ok. It was not a straight shot to front but was ok. Need to drive down road for dinner but ate at Subway next door one night and was good for... More,1
We stayed at a Comfort Inn Suite in AR and was so impressed there that we booked at the Comfort Inn here. This one had also been renovated but didn't have the same pizzaz of the other one. The bathroom was very nice as well as a comfy bed but had a sloppy paint job. In hopes of grabbing... More,1
This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in.,1
"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean.",1
"Great central location for exploring downtown Napa and the Napa Valley. Good access from HWY 29, HWY 12, and HWY 128. There are plenty of much more expensive choices in the Napa area, but saving a few on lodging allows for stretching for great local food and wine.Thank you for your review and I am glad we were a great place to stop on your visit to the Napa Valley. We aim to be the best value for your in Napa. Hope to see you again in the near future.",1
"We enjoyed the small family run motel. The room was a bit small, but well organized, and very clean. Quiet back street location. Attractive landscaped garden. Breakfast was meager and alternatives are a fair walk away. But I'd stay here again if in the area.",1
The hotel staff was the best ! Very helpful and friendly. Room needed some updates though could work through it for our one night stay.,1
"Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel.",1
"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!",1
One night stay near BWI airport which was fine for what it was.,1
This it's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities. The price is very decent since you're away from the strip (about a good 15+ mins. away). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained. Ask for a room with golf course view.,1
"We stayed 3 nights and had a blast in. My 2 boys shared the back room, while my wife and I stayed in the larger front room. The front desk clerk, Aaron, gave the most informative, lively and thorough welcome ever! I probably commented on how impressed I was with the Bar Harbor Motel way too much, but I was... More",1
"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",1
"Carmel Valley is a pricey place, but the Blue Sky Lodge is a reasonable accommodation right in the main bit of town. It's a bit old, and the rooms look ridiculously low rent from the outside (think beach bathrooms) but on the inside they're not bad at all. The balconies are wonderful, and the optional little kitchenette is useful. The pool and hot tub are a great distraction (do say hello to Molly the pool dog).",1
"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",0
The only complaint that I have was that you couldn't close the thicker curtain so no light came through .. We had a post light from outside shine through our window all night making it hard to sleep,1
"Good: Great staff, superb rooms, brilliant location.",1
This was a good stopping point with our two kids. Breakfast and wifi were good. The desk clerk enrolled us in the rewards program when they heard we'd be staying in a BW hotel twice more in the next year. Corridors a bit dated but everything worked. We would definitely use this hotel again.,1
Great group of guys running the jet-skis!!!! We had a blast and felt very safe! Love the fact they were so close to our hotel! Definitely will return.,1

"This was always our favorite place to stay in Madison despite the parking difficulties. The hotel is very noisy as the building has many hard surfaces.

"We found the rooms large, and comfortable. Price was affordable, staff were nice and helpful. We did find the room did not contain much in the way of utilises, and we had to call or drop down to get cups and glasses, etc. Shower were warm, not hot. Lower floor room might have been better.",1
We stayed a Friday to Monday and was a little put off by the Club music coming from the bar attached to the lobby but overall it was a nice stay. I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time. I didn't like the area and it was a hassle to get on the highway. I probably wouldn't stay there again but I didn't have a bad experience.,1
"The environment starting from the front entrance sets it for the rest of the hotel! They have friendly and knowledgable staff and overall it was the best experience I have had of a hotel. Only thing is, wish they had gym facilities but either than that it was awesome!",1
"We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay.",1
I stayed here for one night because the official hotel for the Trenton Half was booked by the time I knew I would need a room. I've had good experiences at other Comfort Inns so I figured this was a safe choice. When I walked in the lobby looked like it was under renovation. Not a big deal. What was... More,0
"Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement.",0
"We stay here every time we're in Cambridge. It's just a stone's throw from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, so the location is perfect.

It has several restaurants, one of which occasionally doubles... More",1

"included full breakfast had eggs (dried scrambled kind), sausage, potatoes, a Waffle Maker (yay) - on top of juices, yogurt, etc ... our Wireless Internet did not work in our room. The building layout was a little spooky, but the price was VERY reasonable, AND had free parking. This was a great value for 20 less than other Springfield hotels, and much less than staying in DC itself (with just 20min drive-time). I would stay here again.",1
Bad: room 222 is directly below the fitness center and it gets very loud when someone is on the treadmill. Good: Devon at the front desk was a phenomenal host! He went above and beyond to make our stay great!,1
"I got this accommodation as a weekend get away. The property was amazing better than I expected, as were the staff from the minute you arrive the staff and facilities are all 5 star. Lucy the restaurant has amazing food. The breakfast in the morning is great way to start off the day. But nothing beats wine by fire pit... More",1
"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty.",0
"Room was great, staff was professional and helpful, and breakfast was delicious.",1
I want to give this place an accurate review. I stayed here for a week and will be back. I want to point out everyone is comparing this place to most Fairfield Inn Suites. This is not a suites. It's a Fairfield Inn. I agree this place does not compare to the suites. However they are not. My biggest complaint... More,1
"The hotel is really new, clean and modern, all of which are things I really look for first and foremost in a hotel. The location has a bit to be desired however not the greatest area and surrounded by a ton of old buildings, but not much you can do there. The hotel and staff are great, would definitely stay...

"we had a nice room, The front desk was very courteous, recommending a restaurant and giving directions to locations we were going the next. The breakfast was very good. We did not use the pool. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",1
My husband and I stayed here for three nights over the 4th of July weekend. We needed a relaxing break from the trauma in our lives since October. Deer Crest really helped us achieve our goal. We had a river front king room which had the most comfortable bed. Room was kept very clean by the very nice housekeeping staff.... More,1
The room was nice and clean. It was spacious as well. Staff was super nice. It was nice to stay during Friday night lights. Breakfast was good as well. We would most def stay again next time we are in Texas!,1
"Nice, clean rooms, safe - ( they had a night guard on every floor ), friendly helpful staff, good service, efficient shuttle to metro station. The surrounding neighborhood was OK, but not an area you'd want to spend time in. The commute to DC via car and metro was not bad, but a bit longer than I would have liked. The hotel was right off the exit.",1
Hotel room was clean but room smelled musty. Outside walkway and steps could use some work. They do offer breakfast. Cheap rate so don't expect much. We only stayed one night. It was better then tent.,1
"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!",1
"The hotel was clean and staff was friendly but the bed was rock solid and after sitting in my car for long due to the weather my back didn't need any help in feeling worse. Breakfast was tasty, but cold in the sitting area being directly in front of the doors where all the cold air came sweeping in.",1
Bad: air conditioner was a quite noisy when it came on.,1
Room had a bad smell and shower did not work. Room was not clean. It had a drity bathroom. Spoke to front desk and they did nothing. Call customer service did help by giving a free night stay. Rooms do not look like the pictures.,0
"Bad: One person a touch too familiar / jokey at reception when checking in and out, but not really a problem. She certainly wasn't rude. Some might think it adds character. Good: Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed. We could shop happily in the Westfield Mall right next door and In Market Street / Union Square.",1
"This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more.",1
Good: Amazing hotel.good location.very clean.friendly staff.,1
Great location for the hotel could be updated a little bit but all in all we had a great time.... Hotel staff was excellent only complaint what have to be it needs to be updated,1
"Very well positioned hotel, everything is close by",1
"If you are looking for the resort feel where you are pampered day and night then this place may not be for you. If you are looking for a low key, private and relaxing honeymoon or family trip this is the place for you. My wife and I stayed in a studio on the 8th floor for 5 nights and... More",1
"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay. Check in and the numbering system in the hallways. The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in, understanding that several nights were to be paid... More",1
This hotel went above and beyond our expectations as far as accommodations and service. We had the extended stay suite for the bridal suite which was absolutely fantastic. All the girls were able to get ready together. The photographer came and took pictures there. The breakfast each morning was very good. Make your own waffles with all kinds of goodies... More,1
Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.,1
Pleasurable stay other than terrible internet service. Place was clean and in a very good location. Transportation was easily available. Rooms were quiet and special rooms in the hotel were easily accessible. A nice touch was a filled ice bucket when the bed was turned for the night.,1
"The Westin Poinsett is a fantastic place to stay in the middle of all the action on Greenville's award-winning Main Street. The hotel is beautiful, extremely well maintained and comfortable - the lobby/bar area is also a great place to gather with friends. Staff members are quite accommodating and pleasant. The Thanksgiving buffet was extraordinary! The food was top notch... More",1
"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.",0
"We appreciated our rest after a very busy day. The bed was very comfortable. The staff in the bar area was also congenial and helpful with a late meal. The room was smaller than I expected, but comfortable enough for one evening. The hotel looked older and could stand some freshening up. The wifi was limited and fairly weak. Lack of a free or reduced breakfast was disappointing.",1
"Excellent staff, cheery, helpful, courteous , polite, very professional. Our desk clerk Bill and the breakfast hostess Nina were amazing, they went out of their way to make us feel at home and welcomed. we need a scale and since they didn't have one at the hotel Bill went out and bought one, that was very kind of him, this...

"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
The staff were attentive and welcoming. The river view lovely. The room was not comfortable. The bed needed replacement as did the linens. The space was taken up with long shelves w pillows. Seating would be better .,0
They don't tell u when u book a room but when u get there a sign is saying ur card will be charged an extra 50 a night and it will be refunded n 7-10 days...at this point its too late to cancel because they will charge u anyway...so that's y the price seems cheap but n the end ur paying more and its higher than other places..,0
"I always return to the Varden when traveling to south LA and Orange County. The location is convenient and centrally located, parking is easy, service is great, and the hotel and rooms are extremely clean.",1
Bad: The breakfast was good but there could've been more variety to it. Good: The location was amazing! I also liked the fact that the hotel was very cosy.,1
"Staff was friendly. However, they charged my debit card 3 times then when I actually got there to check in they took my credit card and charged it once. Breakfast was okay. Mostly carbs. TV didn't work at first until the next day someone came to fix it. No ironing board in the room. Was kinda noisy outside with other... More",0
"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong",0
I always stay at the Hyatt. It is the best. A very nice experience and good food also. The folks at the desk and restaurant are always very helpful and friendly. Hotel is kept up with quality and cleanliness throughout.,1
"Everything was very good, but pool looked bigger in the pictures and controlling the room temperature to be comfortable.",1
"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again.",1
"I loved this little motel. At first we picked it just for the location and price. Turned out to have very friendly service, and clean rooms. It's not a 5 star, but if you are a thrifty traveller you will like it. The pier and Venice Beach were just a 10 minute walk away. Main St. has lots of cute... More",1
"Beds were a little uncomfortable, but they made up for it with lots of pillows. Woke up with a crick in my neck each of the first two nights, but resolved it by taking the pillows from the other bed and creating my own pillow-top mattress. Problem solved.",1
"Had a great time at our friend and mentor's 90th birthday party! It was great seeing so many old friends and acquaintances. Setting was great at Regattabar, food exceptionally good. We stayed one day beyond the block reservation period, your reservation staff was good in accommodating a lower rate than the exorbitant rack rate (over twice the block rate for... More",1
"Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast.",1
"It was okay for the price. I was not there during the daylight hours. It was very quiet Needs a little up grade. Afraid of elevator. I was a female,alone,in an unfamiliar town, but i felt safe there. Other than upgrade, it was a pleasant stay.",1
The rooms and service are good but my rate went up over what my company wants to pay. I will have to find a lower rate in Henderson or I will have to stay in Owensboro where I have a lower rate.,1
"The hotel was very clean. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood. The staff was friendly and polite. The breakfasts were better than most hotels. I broke my leg on the ski slope and the assistant manager went OUT OF HIS WAY to help me!!!",1
"Just spent last weekend of October at Gateway in Cooks Forest and really liked it. First, the setting is lovely....fall in Cooks Forest is the time to go. We could smell the woodsmoke as soon as we entered the lodge, dusk was falling, and little chipmunks scurried across a bank of rocks illuminated by the lodge lamps. Get there before... More",1
"Amazing hotel for the price, the staff was very nice. I would definitely stay again if I need to. Close to places and the bed was very comfy.",1
"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.",0
"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.",0
My boyfriend and I came up for a baseball game and didn't want to pay the 350 for a big name hotel so we chose this hotel based on its reviews and its super cheap price. When you get to the hotel it's in a nice quiet neighborhood about a mile from Fenway. My boyfriend and I actually walked down... More,1
"We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!! My wife and I arrived at 11:20PM and no one was in the front desk. We waited for 20 minutes unattended and finally someone came to check us in. While we were in the room, we found one of the twin bed did not have blanket/comforter. We called 3 times and the last answer was the house keeper left and he would send us one TOMORROW MORNING. It was 1:30AM by then and we were all exhausted and decided to give up and sleep with A/C off.",0
very peaceful and not from restaurant's and highway. very clean and staff was very pleasant,1
"Hotel work in progress. Pretty enough and nice roof top bar. Tiny gym. Terrible WiFi and worse service and effort in dining room. Its not a great deal with these issues. If they care they can improve but not clear they do. Also my room was not clean until 6 on the day we checked in forcing us to wait 2 hours. Thank you for choosing NOPSI! We appreciate your feedback. I am disappointed to hear that service did not meet your expectations. If travels should bring you back, we would love the opportunity to demonstrate our service levels in the future.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"Mary and Jose did a magnificent job of making our family breakfast - 22 people - come off perfectly. The food, Sunday brunch, and the service were outstanding!!!! I will definitely use the Weston again for functions.",1
"The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",1
"The Brookshire Suites was a perfect place to base ourselves while exploring Baltimore. It's walking distance to the water, to the Visionary Art Museum and to plenty of wonderful restaurants. For those who are looking for an experience instead of just a box room, this is the place for you: an overall well-designed feel with great art and friendly staff! We already booked this for our trip back in the fall.",1
Myself and my daughter (11) have just spent 7 nights at the amazing Coconut Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu - our girlie holiday. 23rd October 2015 to 30th October 2015.

"Great place to stay. I did a road trip with my significant other along the California coast. We started in San Francisco, spent the night in Monterey.

"Bad: No soap available, just shower gel. No hot water for three days. Good: Super room 10 on third floor. Loved the squishy soft duvet. Excellent staff tried very hard to help us with many things. Even had help signing up to Uber for the first time! Made good use of the pool.",1
"I stayed here in Oct/15. The room was very basic, 70. The room was clean but that was it. There wasn't a hairdryer, coffee machine, microwave or mini fridge.

We just arrived at 11:30 pm and are wiped out as we're heading to the airport early in the morning on a last minute and urgent trip out of town.

"Room was a bit small, well furnished, very clean. Very quiet. Would stay again. Right on the Interstate but is very quiet. Breakfast is minimal but the area is very clean.

3 nights of so so... Giant fans blowing in hallway all night.. Bland food... Smoke coming into the room from adjacent rooms... Closet sized bathroom... Very old motel somewhat spruced up... Should I go on I was disappointed in this hotel and would not stay here again.,0
"Just stayed for 1 night because a friend was coming in from out of town. Unable to check-in early, but got a call as soon as the room was ready. Room was very clean. Small, but nicely appointed and comfortable. Nice bathroom, aside from some trouble in turning on the cold water for the sink (handle was difficult to turn). It also took a long time for the shower to warm up. Free wifi is excellent in this hotel.",1
"This is a old hotel so the rooms are a little crowded but it all seems to fit. I stayed here for 6 nights, the bed was very comfortable and the room very clean.

"Bad: The wifi on the third floor was very weak. I had to go to the lobby to use the wifi. Good: The folks at the front desk were very helpful, friendly, and professional. Overall, the location is great value. Just a 7 minute drive to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Excellent breakfast provided. Nice pool. Free parking. Free shuttle to parks. Lots of restaurants in the area. 30 minute drive from Orlando airport.",1
"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.",1
"Bad: They don't have complementary internet in the room. Good: Love the location, the room was big and very comfortable, love everything about it!",1
"Bad: Too expensive, thought when I booked that happy hour and breakfast were included. The room was not worth 300.00 a night. Good: Loved the location and view",1
"Had a great nights sleep, bed was very comfortable. Clean well kept room friendly staff at desk. Plenty of hot water, Dish network with all the channels. Will definitely be back. Price was very responsible.",1
Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.,0
"We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans.

The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I recommend the larger rooms over the smaller ones, since the small rooms are really... More",1

"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West.",1
"We made a reservation for a King room. Upon checkin, we were given a key to a 9th floor room. To our surprise, when we opened the door, it was a room with two beds. Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes. Would have been nice if one of the waitresses came over to inform us they were closing instead of just looking at us stand there waiting to be seated.",1
Good: Room was lovely with great linen towels etc! Great coffee n basics ! Fabulous location close to everything!,1
"I have to say this was a nice, clean, ultra-modern hotel. Having said that the best thing was the customer service...outstanding! The tv was small, but we loved the swivel feature so that you could be on the couch or the bed. The fitness center had more machines than most hotel fitness centers however, the morning sun came shining in... More",1
"Pluses: location, all suites Minuses: Rude and unhelpful staff, worst breakfast selection and coffee quality of any Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in",0
"The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !",0
Bad: No pool. The Breakfast room was not appealing. The buffet was limited. Good: The heavenly beds,1
"Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms.",0
"Overall, a comfortable stay.",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels,1
"Pleasant stay, friendly staff,  On the internet site it claims that there is complimentary breakfast, but there was no complimentary breakfast",1
"We found the room very clean, the hotel staff was friendly, the breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. The only thing I'd do different next time is self-park. We used the valet parking, which was wonderful, but we didn't need the car during our stay because everything was so close. We could have saved some money by using the parking deck located behind the hotel.",1
The hotel was close to my family who we were visiting. The staff were outstanding.,1
"Excelent hotel very clean, great for families,couples or single persons will difenitely stay there agian hotel was worth every dollar spent on",1
"Shower wall had old scum on it. So I took a bath, but not tub plug to stop up the water. Help them room 122.",1
"First, this place is super quaint and cute. Some of my biggest takeaways were: - Location was great, considering we had our 10 month old baby girl with us. No one treated us differently because we were there as a family. - Rooms were a little dim for me, but they were clean and decorated very nicely. - Loved the... More",1

"This hotel has all the amenities we wanted. The bar is wonderful. The food in Vines, the restaurant, is exceptional. We have enjoyed the wait staff tremendously every time we dine there. The location of the hotel is in a very nice area with many restaurants. For families, it is close to Magic Mountain.",1
"Bad: Need more than 2 small drawers The pillows given were too hard but when replaced w down - perfect!. Good: The breakfast was just enough for busy travelers served on each floor. The cocktails on the 6th floor was wonderful. The rooms were exceptionally clean and the beds were very comfortable The staff Gabriel, Rachel and Drake went out of their way to make our stay wonderful I would recommend this hotel highly",1
"Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel. Perhaps it was the bathroom, urine smell that greeted you as you entered the lobby the 1970s carpets,... More",0
"I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking",0
"Booked a room at the last minute - sight unseen. How refreshing to see a hotel in a nice setting, but close to Route 93 and Boston. The front desk personnel, condition of the room and, can you belive it - a hotel breakfast was over the top. This is my first choice for hotels north of Boston.",1
"Arrival experience: Clean lobby. Upon entry, front desk personnel greeted us and assisted with check in. Room (general): Overall nice-sized room and well laid out. But carpet, walls, and furniture worn and not very clean. Photos are of room 403. One photo is of a footprint on the wall near the bed. We noticed many marks on the walls and... More",1
"The hotel was very nice , and the staff was very freindly",1
We had a great time at sailor jack.. the staff is sooo friendly and the rooms are updated.. they are right by the ocean.. it's a great place. My family loved it. We been coming back to sailor Jacks for family vacation every year !.,1
"Alright. I'm going to keep it extremely real with you guys. This is hotel is just okay but the price, location, and amenities make it good. LOCATION It's in the hood. No joke. I'm from the Southside of Chicago so it didn't bother me and I'm used to neighborhoods like that. If you are NOT from a big city and... More",1
"The hotel was busy with a softball tournament, but our room was quiet. Breakfast was good.",1
"Great rooms with huge beds, but very expensive. Amazing view over the city if you live higher up. Breakfast is not included, WiFi neither. If you take the buffet breakfast (around 35 USD!), cappucino is not included (7USD), only regular coffee, which is a bit strange and really expensive in my opinion. There is an indoor pool and a spa... More",1
"We stopped overnight after a looooong day on the road (plus a violent storm was coming). We called ahead (about 30 minutes out) to book a room and when we got there, the gentleman who checked us in was all ready for us! And what a nice guy! We got our AARP discount, and when we got to the room... More",1
Bad: We arrived later than expected. There was no assistance with the luggage. We had to carte everything to our room by ourselves. No help. Good: Facility is nice.,1
I have stayed at this hotel several times and every time something little was wrong but we overlooked it. As I was checking in the front desk/manager told me that my room was a problem room 312 because people smoke in it. She said there was a smoke smell and smoke burns. That was the least of the problems when... More,0
"Agreable sejour avec la famille, personnel agreable et accueillant, dejeuner copieux (buffet) mais sofa-lit tres inconfortable. Destination recommandee pour famille avec enfants et petit budget mais un peu loin de la plage. Mais d'un autre cote, distance suffisante pour endormir les enfants au retour de la plage et se proteger des bruits des nuits chaudes de Virginia Beach.",1
"I spend a lot of my life in hotels and I can say I hardly ever review them. The service at this location, is so great though it is hard to not say anything. We recently had our meeting at this location and they took great care of us. Ivana made the rental process easy and painless. Then there was... More",1
"Great hotel! If you are going on the Winetrain in Napa, it is conveniently located 5 - 6 minutes away and is a very safe, clean and comfortable place to stay. Only problem we had was the shower water temperature was difficult to set and maintain! Hopefully they may be able to fix this minor problem!",1
This family-run lodge exceeded any and all expectations we had from the moment we arrived. The stunning grounds located off a flowing river and surrounded by trees were matched only by the tremendous warmth and generosity of the people running the resort. It's hard to a imagine a more perfect place for a group retreat or a family getaway.,1
"We just stayed at the Suncoast. The room are very spacious and clean. We had a deluxe King size room - the room, with the pull out couch could easily sleep a family of four. The room we clean and well maintained.We dined at the Italian restaurant - the food was good and the service was about the same. The casino is clean and well vented. The floor service is a little slow, but that is very common now a days.",1
"Bad: Advertised as Hotel, Casino Spa but there was no casino. Very disappointed. Good: Restaurant staff were very attentive and food was good",1
The breakfast was delicious and the staff was friendly. I had a problem with my room it felt damp and the carpet could use a good shampooing but the manager did try and solve it but couldn't so I left.,1
"Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game.. Great ideal location for ballpark access- w/ parking included easy walk to ball field. Great breakfast. Best value for suite of any hotel i stayed in over my week in California.

"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!",1
"There is no finer staff I have found in my stays in hotels. Perfect location for attending an Army Graduation. Clean,Clean Clean room. The only flaw is there is no place to eat lunch or dinner on site. Columbus GA is a bit complex to drive about if you are new to the area",1
Staff not all that friendly or helpful at check-in. Hot water was scalding and regulator did not work properly. Breakfast was not great. Toilet had slow leak.,0
"Love this place. Fantastic housekeeping service, comfy beds, free parking, free cookies, coffee and lemonade in the lobby most of the day, free breakfast BUT the BEST part is the proximity to the park! We could literally see the crosswalk to the main entrance to Dland from our room! No kidding. the ONLY complaint I have is the air conditioning... More",1
"I stay at this hotel frequently and always receive friendly service but this time my experience at the bar was exceptional. I arrived later than planned and came downstairs just before the bar closed. Lindsay allowed me to place an order and provided friendly, attentive service that made this stay a positive experience. Rooms are clean and modern. I look... More",1
We have stopped at this location on 4 previous occasions and have stopped at many hotels in the area and still consider this the most friendly in the area. All the staff were friendly and went out of their way to help especially Lauren at breakfast. They were happy to arrange a late check out and ensured everything they could... More,1
"We stayed at this Best Western in mid-March and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for not being a high-end hotel. It is on a busy route and is not in a scenic spot, but it is handy to the highway to area attractions. Most importantly, it was neat and clean and looked like the decor had recently... More",1
It was ok for the price. Brake fast is goog the room has little bit smell,1
"This new hotel is immaculate and the staff was wonderful. Ben at the check-in desk was very friendly and accommodating, and went out of his way to make sure our stay was pleasant. Ben answered all of our questions and did it with a smile. He gave us great directions to the church for the wedding we were attending, and... More",1
"Check in went smooth and the view of the strip and mountains was nice BUT although the room was large the dark brown walls and decor was reminiscent of a boardroom. Now on to the issue of housekeeping.... I initially noticed that the night tables were not dusted upon checking in, but didn't give much notice as we were very... More",0
Solid Spot. The only thing that needs work is the food in the hotel. Had 2 meals (1 at the restaurant) and 1 late night room service. Neither was good at all.,1
The photos are very misleading. The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold. I complained but was told there was no other room available. I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to.,0
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Location, size of room, cocktail lounge from 5 pm to 8 pm, size of bathroom",1
"We do Portland weekends several times a year and we've had great experiences in all the hotels that we've stayed in. A friend recommended the Benson, so we decided to give it a try. Gorgeous lobby, very friendly and efficient front desk staff, good-sized room (Junior King Suite), and a comfortable bed. The room was very beige, which isn't a... More",1
"I booked an upgraded room and the room was just average, nothing fancy for the price. The area is good if you are attending a conference at the Moscone center. You will have to walk about 1/4 - 1/2 a mile towards downtown for some decent food. Black cars and taxis are available upfront. For cheaper alternative, there is a... More",0
Drs appt at jhh. Shuttle convenient. Breakfast good.,1
"While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel, the Omni for our two nights there was excellent. We experienced a clean room, very friendly and helpful staff, good food, and location. The bellman went out of their way for us and we had no complaints. We would stay there again.",1
"Our group meets each year and locations have varied across the country. The group member living in the area makes the contacts and hotel selections. Finding a hotel with good price and suited to the needs of our group can be a challenge. After considering approximately 10 hotels in the area with the capability to host our group, we selected...

"We were there for a youth wrestling tournament so we stayed for just 1 night. It was close to the events center, but it wasn't right in the downtown area where you'd have parking hassles. It was close to the interstate so we could easily get to other parts of the city.",1
"The airline put me here when weather delayed my flight and I missed the connection. The place is not well maintained in general. I will put up with a lot, but when a dozen cockroaches run out of the room when I opened the door, I'm out. This place should be condemned.",0
"Best place to stay in Seattle. All the staff are really friendly and helpful. Rooms are spotless. Beds to die for....Seriously didn't want to get up. Many restaurants, bars, and things to to within walking distance. Delicious Cupcakes every afternoon. When we need a place to stay in Seattle we will always stay here. Wished we could have stayed longer.... More",1
The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.,1
"Clean hotel, friendly service, but breakfast isn't included. This hotel is located outside BWI airport, which is great if you're flying out of BWI. But being about 10 or so miles outside Baltimore, it made it extremely inconvenient to get to downtown Baltimore from here. The light-rail train took us almost an hour from Penn Station, and that was just to get to BWI, not even to the area where all the hotels are. Really inconvenient without a car.",1
"Nice stay, clean rooms. Right off the 15 fwy. The staff gave us the 2 rooms we requested next to each other. They were comfortable. The continental breakfast was sufficient. Walking distance to Peggy Sues diner. (Not affiliated with the one off the I-15 near Barstow).",1
"I travelled here with my pup as a midway on my trip home to NC. The check in was simple and fast and he gave me an extra discount because I had my AAA card and originally I didn't think they did that. The room was good, no smells, no stains, just plain nice. I recommend for anyone travelling and... More",1
"We had a 3-day business planning retreat here. We wanted an environment different from the average, away from the day-to-day, where we could unplug, unwind and connect fully with what is important. This was perfect. We rented the entire bed and breakfast. Way better than a typical hotel. Started each day with a brisk long walk in the fresh air... More",1
"Very good situation in the center of Philadelphia, the beds are perfects. Our only night here was just great, the night are completly dark, which is important for us, and very quiet. John was very helpfull. Thank youCD, We appreciate the great review! Glad you got to take advantage of the blackout shades and quiet space for a restful night sleep. Hope to have you back for more than one night! Evan",1
"Great service, awesome breakfast Poor, old building, elevator was not working for a 5 floor building!!!!",0
"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.",0
"We stayed here for one night at the end of May. It was a last minute find and we got a great room, very clean, stylish. Amenities were great. Free wifi. Close to town. We would definitely return if we end up in Ojai again.",1
"We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!",1
"It was very Clean for a great Rate. Sufficient WLAN Speed but not for Free... New modern interior with Flatscreen TV, Fridge, Microwave and Coffee Machine. Free parking. Close to LAX. Will come again soon.......",1
Always a great experience very nice employees make you feel at home or better love this place..great atmosphere the social hour is great way to meet people from all over the world when in Flagstaff Arizona,1

"We came to Maui to get married and were recommended this place by a colleague at my work. We rented a one bedroom condo and I have to say it is beautiful Very happy with our condo.

"Very nice, very reasonable, very clean. Nice friendly staff",1
"The Embassy Suites is a beautiful hotel. The staff at the complementary bar were very helpful and made a great margarita. The breakfast was good, but the layout was a little confusing. There seemed to be a lot of extra space that was not being used in the breakfast area. I was surprised at the condition of the hotel room,... More",1
"We stayed in one of their penthouses which had a beautiful private balcony. A nice bedroom, kitchen, and lovely living room. Every evening they have wine and cheese, followed by warm cookies. In the morning they have a lovely continental breakfast in the morning. Several blocks to the beach. Great Location. We stayed 5 days and could have stayed more!",1
"Great hotel, excellent service from staff including front desk and the restaurant. Breakfast was a fair price and had many options. Food was excellent. Wait staff paid excellent attention to customers. Knew what they wanted for refills and such. And as I'm diabetic, I loved that they had sugar free stuff available. That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate. Would recommend to others and would definitely come back again. Rooms were comfy and beds were comfy too. Only complaint with room was very noisy air conditioner or fan or something in the room. All in all great hotel for a great price.",1
Bad: Breakfast is poor. Good: Location is great,1
"No restaurant- you still need to go to Benvenutos at the Holiday inn. But sparkling clean and new. Nice staff and good location. Basic and serviceable. No issues, would probably choose to stay he again instead of the main hotel. Short walk.",1

Comfortable and nice breakfast,1
"Very friendly front desk staff. Clean comfortable lobby and sitting area. Great breakfast. Make your own waffles, biscuits, gravy, bacon, eggs. The rooms nice and spacious. The beds were comfortable. Very clean and nice cold AC. They didn't have shampoo. But not a biggie. Nice indoor pool area and small sundry shop for snacks and incidentals. Everything about the hotel... More",1
"Great over night stop, truck and trailer parking, pet friendly, easy access. The art in the hallways looks like they bought it from the discount pile at a poster store in the mall. It's really quite an amusing bunch of wall art.",1
I was here for a school trip to Louisville with a group of students. They were overall pretty accommodating of us at the Galt House but there were some minor logistical problems. The elevators didn't always work and we often had to walk several flights of stairs to get back to the room. The cafe tried to have a streamlined... More,1
"We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!",1
I was very pleased with the hotel accommodations. I have high standards and this hotel didn't let me down. I normally stay at the W in Beverly Hills but wanted to try Santa Monica.

"The hotel was quiet, exterior condition was poor, interior was very nice for the price.",1
The location is great for shopping resturants. The breakfast is fantastic as well as the staff. The room accommodation cleanliness was top notch. I would highly recommend the Hampton and I will stay there in my future Oxford visits.,1
"All the staff all looked unhappy, and miserable, I think the hotel is in dyer need of some TLC. Or serious attention. Quite lacking for its position and pricing. Waiting staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and attentive. Thank god the friendly staff next door at the Fontaineblur were there to save the days n nights!",0
I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21.

Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing,0
Woke up with crazy bug bites.,0
Tub needed work but was clean. Lounge chair had broken leg.,1
"The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot",0
"I stayed at Honua Kai with my family for a week in late December. The rooms are very nice - contemporary, clean and well-maintained... though I would have appreciated a few more Hawaiian touches. The resort grounds and pool area are beautiful (but the beach is too rocky to fully enjoy). Having the fantastic Duke's restaurant on property is another... More",1
It was great I stayed for a night aside from the failed wi fi it was a clean and comfortable room. Also breakfast was great even when I showed up late. All in all I'd go back again,1

Centrally located centrally located close to centres. Great place to crash after a long flight from Melbourne. Room is well serviced and clean staff very friendly. Nice grounds with swimming pool. However only complaint is the balcony suit with pool views has no views,1
This is a nice little hotel with a great view overlooking a small marina. Nice rooms and inexpensive. Free parking. No reception staff after 7PM but they will leave you a key to your room. A bit outside Clearwater but some nice restaurants close by. Definitely a good place to stay if you have access to a car.,1
"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location.",1
"Comfortable room in a great town. Nothing fancy, just right for a stop on a road trip. Rob gave us great desk service and local advice. Rooms face the sunrise with was lovely. Guide books in the room were a nice touch and we found some great slot canyons from these. Made our trip even better.",1
The sweeper hadnt been ran in our room when we got there. We had to turn AC down to 63 to get it cool in our room. And you had to duck to get under shower head. The mattresses were awful. The sheets were clean.I'm sorry your stay wasn't up to standard. I will work hard to resolve these issues. Thank you for your honest feedback.,1
"Went to Kaktovik seeking Polar Bear sightings, not disappointed! This place is GREAT, photos of Waldo Arms are exactly right, but what photos don't show is the hospitality, warmth, awesome-ness of the people at Waldo Arms and Kaktovik as a whole.

Cant beat the location of this hotel. Its a block away from Bourbon street and minutes away from Jackson Square and other attractions. Plenty of restaurants near by. Staff was extremely pleasant. The rooms were nice and clean. No complaints overall. Booked the hotel through a package deal and got a great deal.,1
"The room was very comfortable and clean. The biggest complaint would be that the shower water barely got above luke warm and the walls were terribly thin. There is no DVD player in the room and the breakfast offerings are minimall. Oh, and beware. Parking is expensive. Great location though.",1
"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.",0

Very nice quiet rooms (all separated) with their own courtyard. Very friendly staff. Short walk to town and wine tasting!,1

"Stayed one night before heading into NYC. Location is very convenient to the train station. Hotel was very clean, staff was friendly, Breakfast was good. Price was very reasonable. Will definitely return again when I visit NYC again.",1
"The room was very comfortable. We used the pool every night, the lifeguard was professional and active. Loved the fact that the Metro was less than a half mile walk, we walked there every day for the trip into D.C. Many shops within walking distance of the hotel, also movie theaters. Breakfast buffet was good, large assortment of foods.",1
"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well.",1
Bad: The construction next door.,1
Bad: We had the bad luck of staying in a room next to a suite. Our neighbors partied until 5 am. Good: Room and common areas were very nice.,1
The room was clean and quiet Carol at the desk was wonderful she was informative quick check-in friendly the pool was great breakfast was really good,1

IT WAS A PLEASURE TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL. VERY CLEAN FRIENDLY STAFF. There was construction at this site initiative done a better job cleaning the area outside not leaving everything this laying outside it was not very pleasant to see.,1
I had to travel to Florida during Spring Break/March Madness for business and I wasn't sure I'd find a hotel but I did! I always enjoy my stays at Best Westerns and this stay was great too. I wanted to take the bed home as it's much more comfortable than my own.,1
"Clean inside and out. Comfortable, room very clean--no complaints. Typical Holiday Inn Express, Nice desk staff, usual free breakfast. One consistent thing across the chain--the coffee is sub par (but I don't blame the hotels for this, I blame corporate). Good location, plenty of dining options close by.",1

nice hotel 15 minutes from DC. clean with nice pool in nice neighbourhood. small bed. bad breakfast,1

"I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle.

I needed a room for a couple of hours to prep for an event. I called the night before and was told that I could check in any time. What wasn't said was that I could check in IF there was a room available. When I showed up at 10am I was told that no one had checked out yet.... More,1

No heat. One bathroom light out. Desk clerks helpful,1
Check in and out was pretty easy. The vanity part of the bathroom was pretty spacious to put all of your toiletries on.

"This hotel is a fine place to stay. I can't really say anything particularly bad about it, but there also wasn't anything great about it. It isn't close to anything. We had to drive 15 minutes to get dinner. The room was clean, but nothing special. I saw a review that said they didn't feel safe in the parking lot... More",1

Bad: Couldn't have been any better. Good: It was absolutely great! Little hidden gem in the middle of South Beach!,1
"Great location in downtown, easy to get in and out of. Parking garage in behind hotel, nice private walkway to/from garage. Nice outdoor patio with firepit. Personable staff who are very sweet. Spotless Clean hotel. The only downfall uncomfortable beds.",1
"Each time I've stayed, the rooms have been clean and comfortable. However, there was no record of my reservation on 2nd trip (made through Expedia), and on recent trip overheard conversation with another guest experiencing the same problem, and his issue was not so much with the lost reservation as with the attitude of the hotel staff. My experience on trip 2 was similar but not quite as contentious. Most competing hotels do not charge for breakfast. This one does.",1
"The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while.",0

Also, the staff is as nice as can be. I enjoyed my stay very much and decide to stay there everytime I visit Washington DC.",1
"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
This is a great place to stay!,1
"Barely a 4-star. Bathroom looked like something out of a Holiday Inn. The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price. Also, they provided 0 benefits as a Expedia VIP member. Definitely would not stay here again. I'd either price down and stay somewhere else, or go a little bit higher to a 5-star.",1
"Bad: Breakfast - pastries a little chewy. Good: Comfy beds, great location.",1

"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from the wait staff for breakfast, it was the managers wife which is even worse, she was very rude and nasty, it was the way that she told us that we had to have shoes on our feet to be in the breakfast area which it was not posted anywhere,...

"While the staff was nice, the keys for the door did not work (old eighties style with many holes. The place smelled like cigerette smoke and was very dirty. The surrounding neighborhood was scary and the parking lot entrance was hard to find.",0
Bad: We had a bit of a problem with our keycards but the staff was so friendly and helpful. Good: The staff was very pleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower was AMAZING!

"I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!",1

"Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME.

We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing.

The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service.",0
New hotel...nice size rooms and large bathroom. Great breakfast selections. Inner Harbor 4 block walk...good dining within close walking distance in Italian Town or Fels point.,1

Overbooked the hotel and didn't have our suite available but the staff worked with us and gave us 2 rooms for the price of a suite which worked fine and the rooms were comfortable no problems with anything,1
The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!,1

"This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother.",1

The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!",1

Doing a 1200 mile jaunt to Orlando when the miles overcame me resulting in a stop at this establishment. A great quick check-in and a clean room awaited and allowed me to be off the road and in bed in about 30 min. The room was well cleaned and the bed and lines were as well. There is also ample...

"After a long 2-week trip we stayed in this hotel. It was so luxurious, everything was just perfect. The best hotel I have ever stayed. The staff was also outstanding, especially Danny at the Front Desk. Hope we will be back.",1
"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again.",1
This was the most charming hotel we have stayed at in a long time. The rooms were huge and with a fireplace and a couple chairs- so comfy and clean. Decorated really cute and the front desk was so accommodating and kind. They have a cute dining area for breakfast in the morning. Wish I could find places like this... More,1
"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.",0
The room had trash in the trash can and there was quite a bit of debris along the edge of the walls. Bed was comfortable.,1
The stay was great! Only complaint (not really) was we were too close to King Street where my wife spent a lot of money. Location was very convenient to all the sights and restaurants we targeted. Hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the best way to arrange our trip to Ft. Sumter.,1
Bad: There was not a dinette set in the room so that my husband and I could eat comfortably. The room was much smaller than I thought it was and there was no safe to put valuables in when we went out. I was not comfortable leaving any thing of value in my room. There was no outdoor pool as stated by you and there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast food was cold and not tasty at all. I don't feel like I got my money's worth from this resort and I will not be staying at Spring Hill Suites ever again. Good: I liked the king size bed.,1
"Bad: Wifi system: needs upgrading, really slow Lobby bar, open till 11. Good: Central Location Hotel Design Room set up Friendly, professional staff throughout Good gym Good Bar and restaurant Play area",1
"very clean, well kept hotel. The staff was friendly and efficient. Nice bonus having a salt water swimming pool and hot tub indoors.",1
"Hi Folks, My wife and I have been loyal Platinum Card Best Western customers for years. We get a clean, comfortable, quiet room (I sound like Tom Baudette) and a buffet breakfast in most of the chain. It also has business services when you need them. Who could ask for more in a mid-priced motel. Regards, OldeBear",1
"We really enjoyed our short stay. The hot tub was nice but the indoor pool was cold, brrrrr. Our room was very nice and clean. We had a recliner in it too! That was a great surprise. Free dinner and free breakfast. The food was wonderful!",1
"Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!",1
Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Staff was very friendly and the bed was pretty comfortable. They had a good breakfast and the waffles were delicious!

Our family loves The Dana this was out 5th time staying there. LOVE IT!!,1
Short but good!,1
"Perfect for one night visit to tour SDSU. Room was clean, looked newly renovated and very comfortable. Not sure I'd hang out at the pool, though. Double queen room was good for 2 people would have been tight with family of 4. Staff was friendly and courteous. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful. Centrally located to all attractions. Would definitely stay again.",1
"We spent 6 days at this lovely resort and everything about it was terrific. We were upgraded to a suite at the far western part of this sprawling resort and had a lovely view of the ocean. It was a long (10-minute) walk to the main area where the restaurants, pools and activities were located but we enjoyed strolling outside.... More",1
"We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again.",1
"Clean, but bed was very uncomfortable. They forgot to put a shower curtin on our shower so I had to call management in the morning to get it put on. Heater didnt put out very hot heat. Bed was bad, woke up with back pain.",1
"So you're on the road and reach Carrollton in early evening. Where to stay Given that Carrollton is a small city, options are limited the fall-back choice is a hotel in a well-known chain, which hopefully will insure at least a minimum level of quality. This Best Western fits that description, based on my recent experience with a one-night stay.... More",1
"Good: Morning coffee was excellent and offered on every floor with some delicious pastries The bed and pillows were comfortable and the hotel was very clean. As a past Chicago resident and frequent visitor, I'd definitely stay here again.",1

The hotel was perfect for a place to lay your head. Conveniently located.,1
"We stayed here with 5 of us, including 3 teenagers. It was a GEM. A real, two-bedroom apartment, with a full kitchen and a living room. I was expecting an ordinary hotel suite, and got much much more. We only stayed one night, so we didn't get a chance to use the pool or the restaurant/bar, but both looked very... More",1

"We booked this hotel while we were traveling to Florida. Very inexpensive so we were apprehensive but on check-in we were very pleasantly surprised.

Would definitely use this chain of hotels... More",1
"I booked a weekend stay at the W for my bachelor party. I booked the room weeks in advance, but the staff said that my room was unavailable due to maintenance. I pressed for the room I booked and eventually got the room I wanted. On top of that, they included drink tickets. The trip started a little rough but it was great. Hotel is situated in a great place and all the amenities like the pool and bar were fantastic.",1
Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience,0
The facility has been upgraded recently and is in excellent shape. The breakfast room was staffed at all times by two very accommodating ladies and was one of the best breakfast setting we have experienced. I have stayed in motels 80 - 100 nights a year for the last 5 years so I have something to compare this against. We... More,1

"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home!

"This is a mainstay within the Louisville, KY landscape. You can tell just by walking in that this hotel has been in existence for some time and is a landmark to the Ohio River backdrop. Beautiful scenery abounds in this stately location.",1
Like New. Exactly as booked. Room excellent .. shower head not great. Fantastic breakfast with outstanding breakfast lady! Great value for price. Would return without question. And you would too. Just do it.,1
I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room. Could have been some more toiletries and maybe cook ware and silverware but good to know next time what to bring. Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late. Very appreciated.,1

We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab.",0
"Arrived by subway, tired and worn. Met Frank at check-in. Took care of everything. Could not have been more helpful. Pointed out possibilities for dining after arrival, offered tips for maneuvering the subway. Frank stood out among all the VERY helpful and friendly staff. See you guys next year!",1
This Hilton Garden Inn is perfect. It is in a very strategic location in the city and adjacent to the train. The rooms were very clean and staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again on next trip to Buffalo.,1

"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites.

Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded.",1

My wife and I were hoping for clean and found it to be extremely well kept. The gentleman that checked us in was very friendly as well. Located in a great location to visit the local bars and restaurants. We would stay again.,1

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. I left my room for an hour after I checked in and someone went in my room and stole my laptop and my suitecase and the hotel took ZERO responsibility for the incident. NOT A SAFE PLACE!!!!I would like to apologize once again for the incident that occurred earlier this month. I have turned over all pertinent documentation to our Risk Management department. Any future correspondence will be addressed by our Risk Management Team.,0
We had an amazing time at the Cornstalk Hotel. Ms.Sharon was wonderful. The hotel is a lovely old New Orleans style. It's cozy and romantic. I look forward to going back for another visit. We went for our 25th Anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it extra special. Thank you!,1

I was even able to find some green.",1
5 star service and amenities at a 3 star price!,1
Parking fee is too expensive. 29 dollars per night is a lot. Hotel should review and consider to low that price for customers. Personnel that is taking care of the cars (valet pkng) think that are in the racing driving the cars too fast.,1
"Would rate 3.5 rather than 3.0 stars. Location boosts value. Convenient to Arlington National Cemetery. Shuttle available to Metro Station. Grocery store and restaurants nearby. Staff friendly and helpful. Although comfortable and clean, public areas, hallways and rooms are dated. Nearby stairs useful when the only two elevators are busy. Breakfast area on third floor has nice view, but included breakfast average. King suite a little smaller than expectations. Full kitchen nice, but did not use this trip. Additional daily charge for self parking. Overall, a little pricey for condition of property. Might stay again, but will run through all the available options and prices first.",1
"The man at check desk was rude and yelled at me. The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!",0

Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place.",0
"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!",1

"Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations. Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away, so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast. This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four (two young adults). Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Definitely recommend this place, but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering.",1
"The room was exceptionally spacious and comfortable, including a wet bar area and done in soothing colors of browns and teals. The staff was exceedingly friendly and courteous.

I did like this hotel but found the room quite small it was listed as Suites but was smaller than most regular Inns. They had the most helpful people of our whole trip every one was friendly and helpful. We visited the DDay Memorial while here it was a very moving sight.,1
"This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much! This place is really kept up and clean!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for such an awesome trip!!",1
"For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult.",1
"i really like this place. The food was quite good and the service is very nice. They have a shuttle that works very well for short trips. All in all - it is a motel that has been refurbished, but the rear part is actually quite nice and the rooms are big and quiet. I'd definitely stay here again.",1
"Staying at a Hampton is great as you know the product no matter where in the world you are. Here however, there is a much more inviting feel. The Sales team is great and Ashlie has always been very helpful when setting up the events here. Plus housekeeping here is top notch thanks to Jerry's efforts! Thank you both and... More",1
"Stayed with many family members attending a family reunion in 6 different rooms. Most room numbers began with 1 so an incorrect assumption was that the rooms were on the first floor. The hotel seems to be on a slight rise and has different levels for the same floor. Our rooms on the same floor were either accessed via entrance 2, which required some stairs or entrance 3 which required no stairs. Note that there is no elevator. Some issues with a couple of rooms, but hotel staff was quick to rectify. My room included a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast in the conference room below had make your own waffles, hard-boiled eggs, toast and muffins, and oatmeal - coffee, tea, and juice.",1
"spacious, clean room, relatively close to boardwalk, a 7eleven across the street... not prime location (you feel that Atlantic city is not in its best days), but good value (even with the charges for parking) as it is walking distance to boardwalk/beach and the room is nice",1
We really enjoyed our stay. There was nothing to complain about. The suite was exceptionally clean.,1
"I chose the hotel for the indoor pool. The indoor pool was closed. I got a non-smoking room. The room smelled of smoke, as did my clothes, later.",1
Rooms are very comfortable and clean. The Staff was very friendly and nice.,1
Excellent bed and very clean hotel.,1
If you are looking for a great location away from the traffic problems on the Las Vegas Strip try this courtyard by Marriott location.

In house dining but nothing special so look into... More,1
The front building in this two building motel has been updated to nicer rooms. Staff is friendly and nice. Not as many updates to second building but I think that is because they have more long term customers there but the rooms are still nice for the price. I stay here of and on have watched them take this place... More,1
"I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years. The lamp was broken, the wall by the AC looked like it had severe water damage and probably mold. I woke up to cold showers every morning and the shower... More",0

"Good: loved the room, decor and the plinko wall and their game room area",1
Bad: assigned an accessible room without being told. tried to book room direct with hotel but was told tat they could not match thebooking.com rate (even though we were starwood members.. ). Good: bar area,0
"I found this hotel to be clean, fresh in appearance, and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. It was good to have a restaurant on-site and we found the food to be quite good. No complaints. Thank you for the stay.",1
"Good: The best beds and pillows I have ever slept on. Near Little Tokyo, convenient.",1
"The location feels like a small paradise. The views are breathtaking. Beautiful sunsets. While there are a lot of stairs down to the beach, they are real stairs built and provided by Seacrest. The beach feels like a private beach. Downtown and the pier are walking distance from Seacrest along the beach.No need to go anywhere. It would be nice... More",1
Staff extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast in the morning on the rooftop lounge was a lovely bonus.,1
The TV was out of order and only 1 set of wash clothes in the room for 2 occupancies.,1
"We decided to try the Americana Hotel for a night. Pluses: clean room, comfortable bed, nice TV with lots of cable. Breakfast (free) was pretty thin: donuts/bagels, oatmeal or cereal. The room was much cheaper than anything else available, and there was lots of parking- for free! Most hotels charge 28/night for parking, so this is another big cost plus.... More",0
"Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says. You have to pay additional fees at the hotel. Definetely, not going back. Good: The receptionist was friendly. You can get some coffe in the back.",0
"I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America. I know you get what you pay for however, this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday. It's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the... More",0
This was the only place we could find at the last minute when everything was booked up and we couldn't understand why until we got here. But even still we could not have asked for anything better for the price. We were literally 10 steps from the beach and located in the heart of Front Beach Road. It was biker... More,1
Bad: My money was stolen at the valet... room was dirty and had to get another then key card didn't work for new room. Manager did his best but I was disappointed. Good: Location,1
The hotel is very close to the freeway - in fact we looked down on the off ramp. Looks like they are still updating - but the bathroom really needs help,0
"This is a surprisingly upscale hotel, with beautiful decor, comfortable rooms and a very helpful and friendly staff. It would definitely have earned 5 stars if not for its pet deficiencies. 30 a night seems rather steep given the pet area is quite a distance form the main building. The first time we stayed, it was covered in a nasty... More",1
We drove down for a weekend getaway and to celebrate a special birthday. Our infant son accompanied us. The room was nice but the bathroom was fabulous. We appreciated the separate large shower from the tub and the private toilet. I wasn't as much of a fan of the closet being inside the bathroom as it was a trip to... More,1
Very nice accommodations conveniently located at Turkey Creek shopping area of Knoxville. Very good value for the price. Staff extremely helpful. Stayed here one night while Christmas shopping in the Knoxville area. Would highly recommend.,1
stayed in 4. The layout was good for one of their small suites. Had elk in the driveway the first morning. A limited view of the river across the road. Staff was nice and the fruit available in the office was a nice touch. Reasonable price for Estes Park. Nice access to town and park. RMNP is the true reason... More,1
Bad: Room was a little small but cozy. The cleaning maids were very loud and woke me up in the morning. Could be more respectful of people's sleep. Good: Staff was friendly and helpful. Shower had a modern feel and steam feature.,1
Checked in July 6th. My room was perfect clear and comfortable! The keurig coffee maker is a plus! A very friendly and helpful staff made my stay great. The ruby Tuesday restaurant within walking distance is one of my favorites.,1
"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area.",1
"Nothing spectacular. Good hotel. Kinda in the middle of stateline and actual SLT so walking seems kinda a pain. I thought they had redone the pool building entirely, but it was just a new facade. The rooms look bad, the best was uncomfortable, the wifi was inconvenient, the outlets only half worked.",1
"I was very apprehensive about staying here having read some reviews and have come to the conclusion that only complainers write reviews. We had a wonderful stay in a cheerfully lit spotless room, with gracious staff which was also an excellent value The rates even went down and we were offered the lower rate. I would gladly stay here again... More",1
"Great view, great pools, my girlfriend loved the full kitchen and the washer and dryer.. lots of families but the adult pool was quiet. Beach area was nice also . Loved our stay!!!!

"This hotel was dirty, and it was a MOTEL, not a hotel as described. We tried to cancel after checking in, we were booked for a four night stay (through Expedia) but could only get half our money back. I'm surprised Ramada would put their name on this hotel at all. Staff was not professional (wore sweatpants), and there is... More",0
I loved the hotel very clean comfortable! Great staff will stay again if im ever in the area!,1
"We recently stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for a wedding we attended. This hotel was chosen by the couple, so we weren't sure what to expect. The staff was pleasant enough. Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well.",1
Very nice resort like experience. Great amenities. Well kept property and staff is very friendly. Plenty of areas to relax and enjoy the view of the ocean. Highly recommended. Lots of heaters and fireplaces if it gets too cold. Pool and spa areas are spacious and very well maintained. There was a very good mix of couples and families with... More,1
Absolutely great service. Only con is that the low-emissions paring is apparently for everyone and is not enforced at all!! Owning a tesla it was very frustrating how tahoe's and escalades could park there and i couldn't!!!!,1
Bad: Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4.30 (advised it would be ready from 4). They didn't have a two queen bed room as booked so we had to take a king and a roll in bed as there were 4 of us. Good: Good location and a good price,1
Very new. Very clean. I recommend staying there if visiting Baltimore or the surrounding area. It was a 10-15 minute drive to Baltimore from the hotel. Great price per night. The neighborhood is all hotels with a Wendy's and Bob Evans near by. I'll stay here next time I'm in the area.,1
"Our group arrived at the hotel early - approx. 11:00 am and were pleased to find our rooms ready. That was nice as we were able to relax and get a little work done before our meetings. The room was clean and functional. Comfy and quiet. Its so nice to have a fridge and coffee area, and not have the... More",1
"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days.",1
The staff made it a very enjoyable stay. After check in the front desk clerk made fresh cookies and lemonade. The rooms were very clean and fresh smelling. The breakfast was very good and fresh. Will stay on our return trip.,1
The staff was amazing and the breakfast that came with our stay was great for the price we paid.,1
"Bad: We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid. Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night. We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible, and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last. While the property was nice, it was not what I expected for the price. We get a better value from Hampton Inns. Good: Our room was well appointed and comfortable. As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall, the hotel was nice.",1
The had a bad smell. It smells like wet carpet or maybe mildew.,0
The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.,0
Our stay at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Columbus was fantastic. The front-desk staff were kind and helpful. The lobby was sleek and modern. Our room was very clean and very well-lit--- which is very important when you're studying for the bar exam or doing work. The bathroom was very clean. The beds were comfortable. I loved the city views... More,1
"Booked this place to stay the night for a wedding that I was attending. It was me and a couple of buddies so all we really needed was a place to crash at the end of the night. It was fine for that. Would I bring my lady here for a romantic trip, no. But if you need an affordable... More",1

I stay here frequently. It is right across the highway from where I deliver trucks. The rooms are always clean and comfortable and the owners are friendly and helpful.

We were looking for a hotel that was convenient to the Va Beach ampitheater. This fit beautifully for what we were looking for. The only downside was that the sink had dark hair near the rim of the sink (perhaps from a man shaving) that the cleaners must not have been able to see. The staff were helpful in finding a restaurant. The icemaker on our floor did not work but the staff filled our cooler from the icemaker in the kitchen.,1
Good: The free continental breakfast is beyond our expectation and saved us lots of hassle in the morning. Our whole family loved it.,1
"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!",1
The hotel itself is older and the rooms need a few updates . The lobby/pool area is awesome!!!! Great play areas for older and younger kids. Air conditioner super noisy. Beds were very comfy. Great value .,1
"We just loved the Aria, everything from the Tower Suites check in to the music selection playing throughout the resort was just amazing. Very clean and spacious rooms weather a suite or just standard deluxe room. A little on the pricy side but in my opinion worth it,",1
"It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards.",1

Came down for Valentine's day for a little vacation and enjoyed every second. Bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and big for our 4 night stay.,1
"Check-in went smoothly. Staff was very professional and helpful. The room smelled a bit stuffy and the air conditioner could have used a change in its filter. The room overall was clean tidy. The morning breakfast selection was okay. It offered the waffles and fruit, etc., I wished they had prepared the oatmeal instead of providing instant packets. Some of the fruit was very ripe and not as fresh as it could have been. Plenty of parking and close to the interstate.",1
"We chose this location because we had a wonderful experience the last time we stayed. It is a big spacious room with all of the amenities. It smells clean and is clean when you enter the lobby, halls and room. I learned that staying in the ground level was not good for my cell phone service. The pillows were comfortable... More",1
"Was probably once a great place. Needs an overhaul. The rooms are large, but poorly air conditioned. The pool is indoor/outdoor, which is pretty neat. The spa tub is old and needs to be updated. There is plenty of truck parking for 18 wheelers.",1
We have stayed in many condos and resorts across Maui. We wanted to add a few nights on a budget and this place was perfect. The rooms are really small but they have them very organized. The staff was very friendly and it never seemed as if we were bothering them.,1
I find this place to be a quiet place to stay. I have never had any problems with my rooms. They have been comfy and clean and I will stay again when in the area.

"Would recommend overall. We were there in January and the weather was very cold. We expected outside to be cold. The hotel's entrance doors were open a lot, tho, and that made the restaurant and seating ,common areas too cold to enjoy. Happy hour cold, breakfast cold Poor concierge employees very cold. Other times of the year would be better...OR rotational doors, Rooms was great and comfort in the room spot on",1

"Conveniently located, and the Link walkway was especially helpful.",1
"The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",1
I was extremely impressed with the room. We booked a two bedroom. Both rooms had king beds. This was not like any other Residence Inn- everything was on one floor and the entrance is not outside- it's very classy. I felt like I was in an extremely expensive hotel. I'm definitely staying here again!,1
"The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age. It is really close to just about everything. If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special.",1
We rented a room from a DVC member at Saratoga Springs for our family of 5. Disney heavily caters to families of four and builds hotel rooms that are accommodating for that size of family .

Friends and I went to see a show at Ramshead Live at the casino. The Ramada was perfect for our purposes and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful when we were looking to arrange for a cab.,1
"Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose.",0

"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous.",0
"Rm 314 was great! I chose this room because of the oversized clawfoot tub. It would be great for a longer stay since it's basically a one bedroom appartment with a full kitchen, 4 seat dining table and separate living room. There is no view from this room but who cares! I had a romantic weekend planned and time out... More",1
The hotel and staff were nice but upon check in I was given a double when I requested a KING. About 3 hours into my stay another family was trying to enter my room. It seems that I had been given the wrong room by the front desk attendant. They corrected the matter only after the family went to the... More,1
Dirty rooms. Outdated decor. Faulty lights. Bad odor. Terrible breakfast. Would not recommend or stay here again. Disgusting.,0
"I didn't mind the small room, but I didn't like that it was old and dirty. ICK. I honestly couldn't wait to check out in the morning. The hallways had a heavy smoke smell, and then my room had a heavy perfume smell. What were they trying to cover up To top it off, the walls are paper thin. Not... More",0
Bad: Parking fees.,1
"We stayed here for a friends wedding and fell in Love. The hotel is right on one of the main pedestrian roads and within minutes of all the glory that Vail has to offer. The room was cute, super fluffy and comfortable bed. Tiny windows which made the room a bit dark, but not a big deal. The bathroom was... More",1
We were here three nights. there were some kids playing with fire bombs the first coupe nights and there were some smokers right above us that kept throwing their butts over the railing and one night there was a car in the handicapped place right outside our door. The gardener kept trying to keep the butts picked up and did a pretty good job of it!,1
My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car.,0
"I booked two nights at the Inn through Expedia however, I was incorrectly charged to my personal card. If this issue had been resolved in a timely fashion, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker however, after the refund of the mistaken charge, I was once again charged on the 29th of December, a full 10 days after I stayed...

The location of the hotel was great. It was just a short drive to turner field and right across the street from the aquarium and the coke museum. The stay was good as you got your room cleaned daily with new towels and new soap. The breakfast was very good as it does cost around 12 for adults and... More,1
"The hotel people were amazing with us. We went there because of the hurricane in Florida, we were sad and very stressed. They made us feel like in home. THANK YOU GUYS,,,,YOU DID IT GREAT. See you in a near future !!.",1
"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!",1
"One night stay for business was fine. The room was clean, staff was nice, and breakfast was ok.",1
"I stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn May 6- May 8 and this Hotel was very under staffed, the location was excellent and the service was okay, would have been better if they had more housekeepers to taker care of customer needs. I liked Cafe they had but other then that the customer service was not that of a 4.3... More",1
We had a great stay at this hotel. Super nice and helpfull staff that made this stay special. Enjoyed free wine tasting with a nice girls in the lobby and live music. Worth it price and location for the hotel! Will definitelly come back to stay :),1
"The hotel has seen better days, but certainly a step up from the low-end chains. Didn't try pool, but fitness equip was fairly rickety. Good restaurants nearby, and good value for the area. Overall pleased.",1
I've stayed at this place ever since it used to be a Clarion Hotel. I was there when they changed the elevators and there since they finally changed the carpeting in all th rooms. Ok gang sorry to say i have some problems that i now can't stand anymore. The elevators need repairing. They are so noisey. You guys have... More,0
Nice cute place to stay for a while. Loved it!,1
"It's a brand new hotel with most rooms facing the sea. We had a road side room but the sound proof was very good that we hardly heard any road noises. The hotel is right next to the Pacific City, a shopping mall full of good shops and restaurants. Really convenient. We used the free bikes from the hotel to... More",1
"Absolutely horrible! I was looking for an affordable place to stay for a weekend trip to Watkins Glen and decided to book this place. Worst decision I ever made! I arrived about 10:00pm, had to ring a doorbell to be checked in by a man who came out to the desk in his UNDERWEAR. The room had a musty smell... More",0
"Great location and a very friendly, helpful staff. Immaculate room and hotel with all the amenities one could ask for. The morning breakfast changed its entree every morning and the coffee was delicious and available all day. The housekeeping staff is very thorough and the room was beautiful. I would highly recommend this Hampton Inn to anyone looking for location and an extremely clean and well appointed place to stay at a very affordable price. This will be our go to hotel whenever we visit family in Maryland.",1
"The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional.",1
I was hesitant about booking this room but only needed a hotel for one night before heading to Panama City Beach but got a good price so decided to go ahead and stay here and we ended up being very pleased the rooms were very clean and spacious had a wonderful siting area and a nice pool that the kids...

Bad: Beds were uncomfortable. The hotel is a lot older than what it may seem in the pictures. Good: Modern decor.,0

My 1st Hampton Inn in Southern CA lead me to consider this brand and our 1 night stay with 2 kids(10 and 6 years old) is great albeit sighted 2 dead bugs in the room which I wrote it on the key card sleeve when I checked out the next day and brought the attention to the front desk. It... More,1
Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that.,1
I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn.,1
Good hotel if you need to be in town and the area for business. Not a choice if you want to stay for pure leisure purposes. Very comfortable basic rooms with all you need. Good beds. Clean. Well maintained new hotel. Staff is helpful. Hotel has a bar and healthfood oriented bistro/snack area.,1
"My family and I were here for a one night stay. Everyone from our check in, valet, bell desk to housekeeping made us feel welcome. We arrived at 200p and they rushed our room with housekeeping so we didn't have to wait. The room is beautiful, spacious and very clean. We were greeted by friendly employees everywhere making sure were... More",1
"From the second you Valet your car, to check-in, service is phenomenal. Highly recommend this luxury hotel. We stay here most times when visiting Las Vegas. Never have we been disappointed. We stayed in a corner suite facing the strip with 3 TVs and 2 bathrooms...can't get much nicer then that!",1
"Ok but the room was not what I expected as far as comfort no microwave , small bathroom , cleaniless could be better",1
Bad: The staff wasn't very friendly and the carpeting in hallway was creepy and looked dirty. Good: Located on a quiet street,1
They were very helpful with restaurants. The location was very good as Sedona was very crowded. There are many beautiful hikes that are close to this destination. We ate at Cecina Rustica which was the best Italian food I have had any ware.,1
"We enjoyed it very much because it is close to subways and to the airport,the attractions.",1
"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.",1
"The staff were delightful and most helpful, with special mention of the front desk! Check-in was a struggle for the staff - quite a few people arrived at the same time. Fortunately for us we were related or attending the same event and were not frustrated or anxious, but there was one person at the front desk. It was unfortunate... More",0
"My husband and I, along with our 14 year old granddaughter, spent the night at the hotel before an early morning flight to TX.

The closet was... More",1
We enjoyed our stay at the Mills House. It was in a great area and we could walk to everything. We chose this hotel because of the area and the pool. We had two kids who enjoyed the pool very much! The valets at this hotel were very helpful and accommodating!,1

Room was clean, linens were fresh, bed was comfortable, water was hot (taste great too), front desk folks were nice, breakfast was good, internet was fast, room ac worked great, smell was nice.

"Great location a block off canal and just outside French quarter, very nice rooms, spacious, not much privacy in bathroom space and somewhat see through shower glass pane into main room. Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Bad: Internet connection not great from my room. Good: Quiet and great bed... But room a bit dark and no view. Super service and boutique feeling to everything.,1
"The hotel was nice. New renovations, the breakfast was very very good, and the rooms were clean. The shuttle to the Metro was great. The front desk workers were not nice and unprofessional. Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro.",1
"On business trips I look for clean rooms. Decent bedding. No foreign smells. Towels that are larger than postage stamps and softer than sandpaper. Not asking a lot.... but many properties cant make the grade. This is a nice, reasonably priced property. Recommended.",1
Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it.,1
The price was right and the room was more than expected. The staff are very friendly and aimed to please. The room was cleaner than in some more expensive hotels. Highly recommend staying here when in town. The breakfast selection was decent and was included so it was a bonus at the room rate. Great experience.,1
Good: Breakfast,0
the management and staff at this hotel go above and beyond... in town for a family emergency and the staff couldn't have been more understanding and cordial .. very professional while being very caring as well ... the property is well run and very clean as well,1
Came here this past week with the kids and dog. Booked a pet friendly room on 2 different nights. There was a nice small dog bed and dishes in the closet for you to use during your stay. If your pet is more than 20 lbs the bed will probably be too small. There is a 25.00 extra charge per... More,0
"This is an excellent place to stay while in Morgantown. The rooms are spacious and clean. One shortcoming is a lack of a refrigerator in room. they do charge for covered parking. Valet paring is available. the restaurant in the hotel is very good. The exercise room is the best equipped I have ever seen in a hotel, it rivals... More",1
Very easy to find. Close to beach and activities. Great breakfast. Would return again. Beach nice and clean.,1
Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.,1
"Whenever we travel I'm always on the hunt for small/intimate/boutique style hotels. I loved this place! Great style, friendly staff and the cutest breakfast delivered to your room in a picnic basket every morning. Did I mention the rooms are massive We booked two rooms, ours was slightly larger than my in-laws but both we're comfortable and spacious. We'll definitely... More",1
"The hotel smelled funny, there was no elevator, there was no bar or chain on the door and it was hard to lock. The beds are on metal boxes. Every time you moved you sounded like an old metal desk.",0
We stayed here as a weekend get away. First time staying at this location. We definitely would stay again. I had wonderful treatments at the spa across the street. Loved the pool area and hot tub and location of ice machine. The fresh fruit water everyday in the lobby was great.,1
"Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location.",1
This hotel has a very good relation betwen price and value.,1
We spent 4 nights here and It was pretty good overall. The place is older but you know that going in and it certainly is not priced at the W so what can you expect. The staff were pretty good and as a Platinum Member they give you a great breakfast. The bottle of Champagne on Ice and a great... More,1

"When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one.",0
"We were surprised to see that we were the guest of the day! Amber was so sweet at check in. Our room was upgraded, too! A real nice two night stay. Very clean. Very friendly staff. I would stay here again!",1
We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson.,1
"We stayed for 6 nights in Cabin 5. It was more spacious than it looked on the website photographs. It did not feel crowded or squished. And the reading room was cute--nice place to sit quietly. The cabins are neither fancy nor shabby, just good old-fashioned cabins with functional kitchenettes or full kitchens that are equipped with most of what... More",1
"While generally speaking I believe that most next-tier hotels are overpriced, I have been satisfied with this Hampton. The staff is kind and caring for a college town, where mostly I see college-age kids running the desks. The ones at this location, for the most part, seem interested in parent-age people, and they respect that business travel isn't the same... More",1
"Had a wonderful stay at the Maxwell this week. The location was fantastic only a few blocks from the Space Needle and EMP Museum.

The room was very... More",1

Interesting staying here for the first time. The reception desk is tucked in a small alcove inside the new main door. The room then opens up into a very nice lobby. You need your room key to activate the elevator. The layout of rooms is quite varied. Not just a straight hall with rooms on each side. I was on... More,1
"Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location, and loads of amenities. The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance. There is a restaurant downstairs where we had an excellent meal, and the lobby bar was fun and relaxing for cocktails. For American standards, the room is small. If you... More",1
"Hotel was clean. Very loud at night. Two bars out front and the strip. Balcony door very hard to get back in and railings spaced out (2 yr old got head stuck). Overall nice stay. No one came in to clean room, just dropped off towels. Close access to beach and everything else.",1
Bad: Uncomfortable beds. Good: Location,1

"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.",1

The internet was so slow that my data kicked in. That I could be OK with just a nuisance. I got back to my room around 9pm and wanted to take a bath. The stopper on the tub did not work so could not do that. I think it is funny how things that are so minor do not work... More,0
Good: Staff were super friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and very clean. Would definitely stay there again.,1
I stayed here on a business trip the hotel was clean and my room even had a recliner in it. The staff were helpful and pleasant and the wifi was nice because no password was required. I really enjoyed the afternoon buffet plenty to choose from along with two free drinks.,1
"Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good.",1
"Hotel is perfectly situated for Angel's baseball games as it is within walking distance to the stadium. Free packing. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.

When you check in the valet was extremely... More",1
"My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!",1

"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend.",1
"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute).

Bad: The view. Good: Everything,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",1

stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!,1
We stopped here because of severe weather on our way to clearwater. The hotel room was Excellent except for the shower curtain..had mold.. everything other than that was perfect! Looks to be newly renovated. Missed that detail..,1
Bad: Breakfast can be better. Good: Everthing is perfect!,1
"Very convient location, but a little difficult to get to off the interstate.. You need to make a right at the light and make a U turn. The room was nice size, had a fridge and micro. No oder untill we turned on the AC unit.. nothing a little frebreeze in the filter didnt fix. The walls were a little thin, but didnt matter much, as the puppy heard everything and anything from a mile away.. hahahaha.....The front desk folks were just great. Some of the friendliest I have run across in hotels. Breakfest was good, Waffels, cereal, juice, coffee.. ect. Will def stay there again because of the pet friendly/no fee.",1
"We stayed at the Best Western Courtesy Inn recently for four nights and were happy with our stay. The rooms were comfortable and clean, they are a bit outdated and the room was a bit smelly but we were only sleeping there as we were out all day. The pool is great to Refresh yourself on a hot day.

"We spent 3 nights at this hotel. Room was excellent, large king suite with flat screen TV, fridge and microwave. We liked the dispensers in the shower for shampoo, conditioner and soap.

"We were through Prosser in Feb, and decided to try Barn Motor Inn, an independent instead of the well known chain. Mistake. The place was empty, and, I found out, for good reason.

"Overall, the quality of my 3 day stay was good. The room and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, the noise level was low, and the staff were polite and helpful. The workout room is adequate. The breakfast was descent and the hotel is conveniently located. Would stay there again!",1
Hotel was better then expected. Perfect stay. Staff were exceptional.,1
Great,1
"Bad: Furniture looks old but mantained very well. It will be perfect if there is a pool upstairs. Good: The foods near Little Tokyo,even more Japanese than Tokyo city itself. The best location.",1
"This place is just a pleasure in every way. Great staff, great rooms and great location. The hotel runs a shuttle to the airport which is really convenient. I love the gym and restaurant. In the heart of Bend and convenient to shopping, etc.",1
I have enjoy my stay at the quality in. It was very quiet and I slept like a baby. The room was very clean and bed was comfy. The shower was very clean with hot water. Big flat screen tv and microwave and refrigerator. The brakefast they had was yummy. Very friendly staff. What I have to say is I... More,1
"I had looked into Villa Toscana before but it was completely full. Last week I lucked out. The location was convenient, the room was comfortable, the innkeeper helpful and the overall experience excellent. Definitely a place I would stay again.",1
Pretty much blah... nothing really to write home about.,1
WiFi was bad spent four days there and got on WiFi 2 times . Water pressure was low. And no decaffeinated coffee. Coffee pot only makes 2 tiny cups of coffee anyway.,1
"In the hinterlands, this BW+ is like an oasis. The facility is in just-built, not-yet-used condition, exterior to beds, Staff always well-groomed, friendly, polite and helpful. Amenities work perfectly. Great restaurants and service stations nearby. We plan our daily mileage so we can stop here.",1
"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly.",1
"Hotel clean, convenient, breakfast good, staff friendly and I would stay again.",1
"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again.

"We found the quaintness of this inn most appealing. The room was very clean and large. The pitched wood ceiling gave the room a sense of spaciousness. A fireplace, seating area and flat-screen tv were welcome features. Big plus for the large bathroom and very comfortable beds. Friendly staff and adequate continental breakfast made for a pleasant stay. And, it's... More",1

"Stayed here for 2 nights, ahead of a road trip. The standout aspect of this excellent hotel is the staff - from check-in, housekeeping, barrestaurant, doormen, parking - everyone was pleasant, helpful, professional.

"Searching for a family reunion site for 50+ folks in Buffalo, WY - we found this place by accident when driving by.

"Valet service takes too long. You can try to call before, but with me they never picked up the phone. Advice is to get down 30 min before you need your car. Staff was very kind when you managed to get hold of them. Good property overall, specially for the price.",1
"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast, 2 Queen Sized Bed room. Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms. Large Bathroom, Clean Quiet... Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher.",1

"We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything. Keep up the good worklwill789,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.",1

This is a nice looking property so we decided to stay here. The staff was friendly at check-in. I got an AARP discount after asking for it. They were also pet friendly and allowed our small dog to stay for only 15. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Everything worked and was clean. Check-out was pleasant. They gave us coupons...

"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money.",0
"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.",0

"My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough, but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh 2014 look. Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue.",1
Nice quiet hotel in the middle of all attractions. ..clean and beautiful rooms.,1
We arrived for our first family vacation only to find out they lost our reservation. I had the print out of our hotel confirmation but that made no difference. Staff was friendly but not helpful in finding us new accomodations.,0
"It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend.",1

At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is be shuffled around from room to room!!!!!! The cleaning crews are ether not trained correctly, or dont care.

"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up.",0
"I can't begin to describe how incredible this hotel is!! Service was beyond my expectations. Their devotion to 100 satisfaction was evident everywhere we went from the bar, the pool, room service, check-in/check-out, and valet. I am proud that my city has such a hotel to represent!!! I most definitely will return!",1
My wife and I stayed one night for a business trip. The accommodations were what we would expect for a Hampton Inn but the staff went above and beyond our expectations.

It was the location that mattered most in the end. It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations.",1
Perfect for getting to the game.,1
We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!,1
Bad: The staff never changed the sheets and I was there 4 nights. No microwave or refrig. Good: I like it was a min from the beach,1
"This was our first time visiting the city of New Orleans. The Omni was the PERFECT hotel. It is in the middle of the French Quarter, but not on crazy Bourbon Street.

We had a great stay at this hotel very near Walt Disney World! The property and guest room were very neat and clean. The furnishings were attractive and the beds comfortable!

We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!,0
"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.",1

The complimentary breakfast had everything you could possibly want and more. Hotel was very clean.Thank you for your kind review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay and hope that you will return soon!,1
"This hotel seems to be in the midst of a renovation. They said that they put me in one of their newly renovated rooms, so I would hate to see what the rooms looked like before. The textiles are new, but they should have invested in new mattresses and new AC units. The room felt damp and musty and I would have rather slept on the floor than on the deflated, old, lumpy mattress that they have on the bed. The rooms are extremely dark, even with every light on. I cannot believe that this is considered a 3 star hotel for Expedia. Definitely not! It feel like a motel.",1
"L'accueil chalereux meme s'il faisat tres froid dehors c'est pourquoi le 3 janvier etait assez froid dans l'espace ou on prenait le breakfast...l'autre jour beaucoup mieux. La chambre assez propre, le climatiseur un peu bruyant...mais c'etait correct....",1
The location of the Charlottesville Hyatt Place is excellent with a variety of food in walking distance. University of Virginia very accessible from this location. Front desk offered directions and guidance.,1
"Bad: Not so close to where I wanted to be, but that was my fault. Good: Loved the layout of the room. Spacious and comfy.",1
"No problems whatsoever. Very nice, clean and comfortable. We visit family in Knoxville from time to time. We will stay here again.",1
"Le Mridien is awesome, consistently the best hotel in every city I've been to one in. The le Mridien in Dunwoody is no exception. Everything is beautiful, and of the highest quality",1
"No restaurant or bar (other than wine/beer). No newspaper availability. Room small, but comfortable... no view. Limited elevator service and somewhat precarious stairs.",1
Good: Excellent breakfast,1
"This was the nicest SpringHill Suites I've stayed at. Beautiful lobby and room, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the price was awesome for summertime. The airport shuttle was quick and efficient. The hotel was very clean. I'd definitely recommend you staying here.",1
I like staying at Best Westerns because I can count on a clean room and the right accommodations. The reason I give this one four instead of five circles is because the room looked like it needed a little maintenance. But it was clean. They have a free breakfast included with your stay from 6 am to 10 am.,1
This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here.,0
"We stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed our stay in one of the lovely suites with kitchenette. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The owners were very friendly and we loved being able to sit out on the porch in the morning as the weather was great. As others have mentioned, it is quaint but we... More",1
"Overall: Great for Solo and business travelers who travel light. Chose to stay at this Hotel one night because I had an event in L.A I had to attend, and I was running a 5k the next morning out in the LBC. First of all the Staff is Amazing! They were extremely welcoming, professional, and helpful. One of the girls... More",1
Bad: There is spa in the name of the hotel and the spa service wasn't available! What a rip-off!. Good: The room was nice with a good view,1
the bed was very comfortable,1
Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious.,1
"The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two.",1

"Everything was great (clean, nice, free nice breakfast, 24 hr coffee, free wifi). The service was extra great. We forgot to turn off our carlights and they helped us immediately to get our day on the way.",1
"There was a slim guy at the front desk who was very friendly and very helpful (e.g.- wrote out instructions to the Metro station). The women were efficient, but not nearly as friendly. The rooms were clean. We also liked the front lounge area. Pool needed some work and the exercise room could use towels (the towels would help to reduce the smell of sweat in the room).",1
"The staff was helpful and friendly. Perfect location, so close to everything!! I would go back in a heart beat! The room I got was off a gated private alley so there was no street noise. In the lobby they have booklets of all the fun things to do in the area.",1
"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback.",1
"We stayed one night here. The Naples area is very pricey. We booked a room here via a Priceline special deal for a reasonable rate. Our room was a large suite with 2 beds. The hotel is relatively new and clean. The breakfast exceeded my expectations and probably saved us an additional 35. Overall, a great value!!!!",1
The first strike was a long wait to check in followed by average accomodations. Normal flickering bathroom lighting with marginal breakfast fare. All choice properties tend to be somewhat the same with the difference being the wifi here didn't work on this trip,1
"Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices.",1

We booked this room using Marriott points. Check in was chaos- there was one person at the front desk and she was doing several things at once. The carpet in the hallway is dirty and thin.

"I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay.",1

Ausgezeichnetes Hotel. Sehr freundliches Personal. Wurde jederzeit wieder hier ubernachten.,1
"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience.",1
"Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests.",1

"The hotel itself was good, good location,very close to downtown silver spring. there are public parking decks nearby (really don't need valet parking unless you are extra lazy). BUT the front desk was really sloppy. FIRST they didn't have our reservation in their system and wanted to charge us with the current rate which was 40 more expensive. THEN they didn't include the breakfast that CAME WITH our reservation. So we had to go back and forth with the front desk to settle these issues, which is NOT FUN.",1
"Good: Great location, clean and friendly staff.",1
The front desk man was very rude. If I didn't like the indoor pool I would never go back again. He was very arrogant and acted as if he didn't care if our stay was enjoyable. Told me false information and made it difficult for me to check in.They need to rehire a new front desk person if I ever see him again I'm turning the other way.,1

I love the Aria. I like the way the tables are laid out on the casino floor and all the dcor. Any staff I came in to contact with was very helpful and polite. Room was clean and a good size. I also think it's a good location and easy to get to a lot of other attractions in Vegas.,1
Great room! Plenty of space for 4 people,1
"No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much.",0
"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team.

"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.",0
I love this hotel. I took a chance on it about two years ago and haven't stopped coming. The hosts are the best. I would recommend this hotel too every one. The restaurants have a good variety of fresh meat and seafood.,1

"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.",0
This is our second time to algoma beach. we love it. So clean. Quite. Friendly staff. Great value. Having the lake as our view just amazing. Will come back for sure. Only 45mins from Lambeau field for u packer fans. Only complete beds are hard. Other then that love it,1

"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great.",1

Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.,1
The rooms were outdated. But they were clean and very comfortable. The hotel has so much potential but it's not being used as it should. I would def stay here again. Price was good. Breakfast was a little disappointing but it worked for what we needed.  The shower was really nice. Endless hot water.  Tv channels we a let down. But we were so sleepy we didn't care.

"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Troegs brewery and Hershey Park. We enjoyed the modern, comfortable, and quiet room. The staff was exceptional and the accommodations were enjoyable. Both Troegs and Hershey were an easy 15 min drive. If we decide to do another overnight stay in Hershey, we will definitely stay again!",1
"So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel.",1

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It's in a great location too! Right next to the highway and just a quick 5-10 minute drive to downtown Charleston (King Street, The Battery, etc.) I would definitely stay here again!",1
"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service.",0

"For those of you who have not experienced the beautiful, revitalized downtown Greenville, this hotel is in a perfect place. Located right on Main Street, this historic hotel is in a great location and offers even better service than when I stayed there 2 years ago.

After checking out from an overnight stay the first week of January I arrived home and found that there was a 150 charge on my credit card for a smoking violation for one of the two rooms I booked via calling the front desk (rate was 76 per room). In checking with my party - no one smoked in the... More,1
"Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though.",0
"The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC.",1
"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.",0
"This was our second stay in as many years for a week. We enjoyed the resort - this Time in a jr suite in building 2. This bldg seems newer and very nice.

The hotel was clean and inviting. The rooms were clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The free continental breakfast was okay. The scrambled eggs were dry and lacked flavor. I would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to people.,1
Very good experience. But the staff manner need improve.,1
Met our expectations.,1
We have stayed there several times. Very comfortable and relaxing environment.,1
"This exquisite property located in the penasquitos canyon of North County is a spectacular retreat.

"Cost of 10k starwood points at the moment. Extended stay hotel that's new. Staff friendly. Lobby is spacious. Hot-tub opens at 8AM in the morning, may close at 12PM. They have 4 cruiser bikes available for guests. Check out the Rio Grande Trail nearby in the summer.",1

This is a nice hotel. I like Hampton Inn's free breakfast. Rooms are clean! The hotel is an easy stop off the freeway. It is walkable distance to Union Square. You can go there to shop or eat.

This hotel is the best experience I have had with any hotel in quite some time. The staff was first rate and they treated you as a true guest. The food was outstanding and everything was calm and respectfully. I encourage any business traveler to choose this hotel if you are staying in the Linthicum Heights area!,1
I am sad to say this place is very unhospitable. At least when I stayed. They advertise a shuttle service Frisco shuttle who are very unreliable.

"This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour.

Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront. The rooms were somewhat smaller and from the orbitz website it looked like the room would be separated into 2 areas - 1 bedroom 1 TV/dining area w/couch. Apparently those rooms are only available across the street from the ocean.,0

Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.,1

"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!",1
Everything was clean and comfortable. The room was larger than any I have seen. The staff was very professional and friendly. I will stay here again when I come back to D.C.,1
I don't even know how this place is still operating. The girls at the checkout desk are rude and confrontational. Their faces depict people that are being forced to work... Not helpful whatsoever.

"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere.

"We stayed for one night after flying into BWI at 1:00 am. The complimentary airport shuttle was very convenient and the first driver we had was great! The second driver made us wait about 20 minutes while he was chatting it up with a woman that worked there which could have made things difficult if we were needing to be at the airport for a flight instead of just picking up our rental car. There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad. There really isn't much of anything by the hotel, but the beds were comfortable and it was a quick and easy check in. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for short stays like we had, but not for a long trip only because there isn't anything close by.",1
This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.,0

"If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!",1
"Bad: Nothing to dislike. Good: Location and staff were excellent, hotel was clean and well presented",1
"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.",0

"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!",1
Bad: They messed up my reservation and I couldn't get free breakfast. Good: I like the room and the city view,1
"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the pool hours didn't accommodate our after 10 P.M. arrival, the bartender still served us the length of time we needed to relax after our long journey. Rooms were great, although we wished for an exhaust fan in the bath. 3 people needing showers in the morning necessitated this feature. Overall, we were pleased with our experience.",1

The beds were hard. Too few outlets. Overall a good place to stay.,1
"I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask.

"Super close to things but off a main road so it isnt super busy or loud. Close to the beach, shopping center, and everything else you could need! The employees were helpful and cheerful.

It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp.

The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",0
The room smelled musty and sink was located outside of the bathroom. We got better rooms for the same price. Very disappointed,0
Stay was good but the hotel adds expenses such as amenities fee of 25/day and parking fee of 35/day which they don't mention. So I paid 120 over the hotels.com rate.,1
Bad: The room was a bit smelly. Good: The location is perfect to get to Disneyworld. Rooms are large and confortable. Staff was usefull and nice. Excellent breakfast.,1
The room was very nice. Even had a microwave as well as fridge. Big screen tv. The only negative in my room was the toilet seat. I had to have someone come clean it and they were right on it.,1
"I have stayed at the Fireside Inn before. When planing a trip to the coast I checked a lot of different options and I made the choice to stay there again. The rooms have been updated and the room I stayed in actually had a gas fireplace. First of all this is not a destination resort, this is a unpretentious... More",1
"We stayed at the San Ramon Marriott for 3 nights. As a frequent Marriott guest, I had access to the concierge lounge on the top floor, which featured free breakfast and snacks. The view from our room was one of the worst I have had, some electric generator type devices. It was too cold to go in the pool, but... More",1
"6 friends on a very short break completely blown over by The Aria. Everything very efficient from start to finish during our stay.Location perfect. Rooms huge and spotless with fantastic views-only downside was the pillows-too soft for my liking. We asked for rooms near to each other and this request was easily met. The lobby areas very clean, casino not... More",1
"We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel. The hotel decor is a bit outdated, so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's. But everything else was just fine about our stay. The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled. There was a coffee maker, as well, with both tea and coffee. The bathroom was small, but everything worked just fine. We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel. But if you would like a clean, comfortable, budget-friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area, the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you.",1
My son and I recently spent two nights at this hotel and really enjoyed it. The only downsides are that a larger hotel was built right next door and it hides the building and that it will be torn down in about a year to build a bigger hotel. That's a shame because this place has history. Our room was... More,1
I was quoted a price over the phone of 383 weekly and even used my credit card to hold the room. On the day of check in i arrived and my room wasn't even ready even after 5pm then I was told that room would be over 500 per week and i couldn't afford that. All the man at the... More,0
"We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever.",0
"My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan",1

"I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door. This was evidently true for everyone as I heard loud banging on the door until I checked out. Also awakened by loud talking in the hall and barking dogs in the morning. Room was clean and nicely furnished but cheap, only... More",0
"Working heaters and lots of hot water. Be careful in the tub, no grab bar and tub surface is slick (I put down a hand towel). Superior bed. Old CRT TV with some reception problems. Furniture shabby. Wi-Fi works. The Korean Baptist proprietors are most pleasant and helpful.",1
"The restaurant has a nice vibe. Staff are friendly and competent. Wine list a bit too simple. Food was good. The hotel is just average. Carpet in our room sorely in need of a cleaning. Bed was comfy but a double when a queen is pretty standard today. Bathroom was very, very clean. All rooms are very small. Internet sketchy.",1
"I was not familiar with DC. After arriving and using the Metro, the police officers and others told me I was not staying in the safest part of DC.

Hotel was great! breakfast was good and the staff we're very nice,1
"We checked in very late around midnight and Tanya was a gem. She was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable although a couple of the towels in the bathroom were dirty, there were enough for all of us to use this stay. I 95 is right out your window so if you are a light sleeper request a room on the front side of the hotel.",1
"When we came for a visit for a friend's wedding, we chose this hotel based on its price an amenities for our group of 5.

"Pool, elevator, laundry room It has everything I needed, any questions the staff had beyond taken care of me, such hospitality that makes you feel at home when you're away. Dominique and Nounie are incredible managers and have a wonderful crew. Thank you all.",1
"Avery comfortable bed, a desk fr laptop set up, and a fridge and microwave made the somewhat extended stay very pleasant and relaxing. Breakfast allowed guests to fuel up before a busy day.",1
"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.",1
I finally found my go to hotel near BWI airport. I travel a lot through that airport and after bumming around I finally found the one!! Very clean hotel with the utmost courteous staff!,1
"I've been here less than 24 hours and this place is incredible. Definitely lives up to expectations I had created in my mind and I haven't even golfed yet. It is truly a paradise with friendly staff, great food, and a wonderful room. We've dined in both The Tap Room as well as Th Bench and both have been fantastic.... More",1
Chose this hotel because we were sharing the 2 bedroom/ 2 bath unit with elderly parents who were to fly in from DFW area. Bad weather cancelled their flight two days in a row. I called the morning after we checked in to explain situation. We wanted to see if we could get smaller room since it was just the two of us instead of four. Stayed on hold for sometime waiting for manager to get on phone. We were unable to change room because we had booked through Hotels.com.,1
"Other than being told on hotels.com that breakfast was included in our cost, but it wasn't, the stay was wonderful. We will be back. For being so close to the airport, no plane noise!!!!",1
We loved everything about the trip. Oak Creek Canyon was beautiful and Slide Rock was amazing! The hotel was great. We loved going out on the patio at night to drink tea and look at the shadows on the beautiful red rocks.,1
This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here.,1
A wonderful place to stay in Santa Barbara. Walking distance of most everything you want to do.

Wine and cheese in the afternoon and cookies and... More,1
Friendly staff was very helpful. Hotel is conveniently located near restaurants and the highway. Room's window faced a blank wall of the hotel next door. But it was very quiet at night and felt safe. Would stay again.,1

We stayed 2 nights at this motel. It was a pretty basic room without a refrigerator or microwave. It was clean and owners were friendly. It appeared that the bathroom had been recently updated. It has a pool and grill area which families used quite often. Rates were fairly reasonably for this time of year in the Old Forge area.,1
"Amazing place to stay with kids, friendly staff, good breakfast variety. Exercise room was clean and well equipped. Indoor pool very small but correct temperature and Relaxing hot jacuzzi tub. I would recommend this hotel.",1
"We were impressed by how pet-friendly Oxford Suites was! We had just adopted a 6yo chocolate lab from Lab Rescue of Fresno, and the hotel welcomed him (and us) with open paws! They also provided a great doggy bag filled with bottles of water, dog treats, doggy scoop bags, and even a collapsible dog bowl! Our room was clean and comfortable, at a reasonable price. And the breakfast was excellent! Thank you Oxford Suites!",1

"My organization recently used this hotel for a conference and our experience could not have been better.

The facilities themselves were wonderful, and our attendees enjoyed the social... More",1
"Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well.",1
"Bad: The valet parking is more expensive than at other hotels. However, we were able to find parking around the corner for 30 less. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful with questions regarding the best way to reach sites. The game room on the second floor was fantastic and not at all crowded which is what I had anticipated. The hotel photos are exactly what you see when you arrive (this is often not the case with other hotels I've stayed in).",1
Bad: Double beds a little small for 2 people. . Good: Comfortable gym and great gym.,1

"The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this. Hotel patrons had to vacate both indoor and outdoor pools for staff to attempt to clean up the residue and of course there was no sunbathing to be had under the circumstances. So much for our ONE beach day.",1
No breakfast hall Poor breakfast Unacceptable even hotels 1 star has a hallor space for breakfast Central hotel Good rooms Very Clean Curtese staff,1
"Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch.",1
Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly.,1

I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see.",1
"Sad to say we took my sister in law and her family there on Mother's day and got the worst service in history. We got in and told to sit in a corner, and obliged.

"Nous avons passe une tres belle semaine a cette hotel, tres propre, personnel courtois, belle chambre il manque rien, 20 min. de la plage les dejeuner etait correcte.",1
Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.,1
My family of six wanted a hotel that would be comfortable but did not offer many amenities that would up the price because we did not plan to be in the hotel except to sleep. I found this hotel very comfortable and clean and would recommend it for a family on a weekend stay (as it is located in a technology park and might be busier during the week). It was relatively inexpensive and close to both Baltimore and DC.,1
"Nice and close to everything. The staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. We had a room that looked out to the ocean at a distance. Nice heated pool. The only thing I can say wrong about the place is rooms do not have microwave or coffee pots, but they do have small items in the office. Nice and clean... More",1
"although the initial nonsmoking room selected on line was found to have the lingering smell of smokers, the front desk staff did not hesitate to relocate us to a similar room that met our expectations. no hassles.",1

"Everything about our stay was very good to excellent.

"This facility is OK if you like an apartment type atmosphere. I did not enjoy having to take a walk outside to get to the breakfast area each morning. It was also an inconvenience not to have an on site exercise room. A very good alternative was provided a short distance away, but I'd still rather have a treadmill available... More",1
This hotel was so roomy and spacious. Real espresso available at the cute little breaky bar in the foyer. We felt safest catching a cab to and from town after dark (8) but super easy by day to just catch the monorail. Very close to our favourite museum in the US - music museum,1
"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns.",1
The reviews made this hotel seem better than it was. It was fine. And we could have been in a better location for the same rate with more local amenities nearby.,1
"Very clean, comfortable, friendly hotel. Nicely maintained pool and spa. Rooms are bright and cheerful. We've stayed in other value-priced hotels at that exit, and this is the nicest by far.",1
"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!",1
"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.",1
"If you are looking for a comfortable beach front location, it does not get much better than this. You would have to rent a private home to find anything comparable on Captiva.

We stayed here for a car show with our 5 year old grandson. The only complaint that I have the ice machine on our floor didn't work. The staff were all great. All the beds are sleep number beds. The wifi works.,1

"Good for the price. The handle on sink popped off when we first arrived, but they fixed it promptly. Staff all had smiles and were very helpful.",1
"Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs.",0
This was one of the worst hotel stays that I have ever encountered they have cleaned our room they left the dirty sheets on the floor after they made the bed they didn't clean the bathroom it was just awful and I would never ever recommend this particular hotel to anyone it was really low budget the staff here at...

"We were there for only 8 hours, but it was convenient and good for a quick sleep. Was thrown off by the 10 charge for the pet, when it wasn't mentioned in the reservation process. We were told pets were welcome, but no additional charge. We had some rambunctious neighbors, and the office took care of the issue as soon as we called down to the office, so that was great!",1
"Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach.",1
"Had to make a last minute reservation to be in Cincinnati, Ohio overnight for an emergency. Needed to be close to the hospital so we booked the Springhill Suites Cincinnati Midtown.

"Very comfortable, we enjoyed our stay.",1
"The rooms were clean, servers and front desk very courteous. A little expensive at 105++ a night but not bad. Rooms were older - carpets worn. Breakfast decent but not all that good. I would certainly come back (and recommend) as it had comfy beds, working AC and very nice staff.",1
Good: Wonderful location. Fantastic staff. Beautiful Art Deco building.,1
"Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities.",1
Bad: Room was small -- terrible view!. Good: Location,1
Me and my husband use this hotel for date night several times a year. It's clean and the staff is super friendly. The breakfast is good and it's quiet. The price is ok could be better but you get what you pay for,1
Bad: The bed was so uncomfortable that I am still soar tired a day from being home. The curtain would not close completely to block out pole light.,1
"OH MY! We had no idea what to expect, but when we arrived, we were BLOWN away. Staff goes out of their way to be friendly. Martisha at the front desk made a first impression that never wavered. The food from the grill by the pool was DELICIOUS! The beds were comfortable. Rooms were quiet at night. This quickly became... More",1
"This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork.

"This property is absolutely pristine. The grounds are perfectly maintained, the rooms are luxurious with exquisite detail and the hotel in general is just a site to see. The location is great if you want to be away from the city and in a quiet area with gorgeous views of the hills (but close enough to to drive to Del... More",1

We stayed here for my husbands graduation 12/11/15. The hotel was nice and so was the staff. Breakfast from 6am-9pm and I had a corner room on second floor which was close to stairs and our car in parking lot. Parking lot was well lite. The elevator was just a little slow so we took stairs most of time since... More,1
"I was in B/G on business and an associate booked this property for me. I was extremely pleased with the front desk (Chris) and other staff, the room was awesome, bed very comfortable and I slept well. My room was at the very back of the property and it was very quiet. The cable TV was not working correctly and... More",1
We just came back from our vacation and I can say that we want to go back already. Honua Kai resort is really great and well maintained. We didn't have any bad things to say about our stay and can only think of great experience there. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful - from valet to front desk to... More,1
"All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us.",1
My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable.,1
"We have now visited Bricktown Hotel on several occasions. The service has always been friendly, the shuttle is prompt and service oriented. As a family, we have enjoyed the pool. As a group of friends, we have taken full advantage of the Bricktown nightlife without having to drive. As a businessman, I have used the Hotel as an incentive to employees and as a TE for clients. I have referred many friends who consider this self to be a Gold Mine.",1
"The hotel is easy access from hi-way-37 at third street exit. It is an easy drive to I.U. campus, football stadium etc.. The hotel is very clean and well maintained.Mikhail ,a new employee, was very helpful upon check-in.

Bad: Outside the center and hard to reach without car! Internet usage requires registration with many personal details. Good: Good offer for the price!,1

Nice room. they offered us a price on events we told them yes we would take that offer and then they was told we could not do it,1
Room had roaches and the toilet was stained the cover wasn't clean. I left out and came back a short time later and I never received room service. I called down to the front desk and the front desk clerk stated that no one was available to clean the room and that everyone had gone for the day. Wow I... More,0
"Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight.",1
I have no idea why this resort isn't on more people's radar. Maybe it's better that it isn't - but now you know the secret. It's located just far away from town that it feels secluded but not remote. The building is well laid out and nothing seems like it is too far. The property is perfectly maintained and appropriately... More,1
My husband and I stayed at Ocean Drive Villas for a few nights to celebrate our anniversary and we were VERY pleased! The staff were friendly and helpful.

Arrived to friendly reception and went straight to pool. Shower and towels did not disappoint. Breakfast was awesome. Staff excelled in service. Will definitely recommend and return!,1

I had a four day business trip in Tacoma and booked into this hotel. I was very pleased with the accommodations! The room was clean and large enough to be comfortable for staying there for four days. I slept well and the temperature of the room was perfect! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here... More,1
"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately.

This is our second time to stay at the Aria. My husband and I love this hotel. Not a lot of horrible traffic through the resort like you have at some of the other hotels. Very laid back and very elegant. Great place to stay if you want to avoid a lot of children. Loved all of the extra amenities... More,1
"Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small. The travel service to the Metro station was quick, which was very important since we stayed there for 4 days.",1
"Very convenient location to Downtown Seattle. Its located right across the Space Needle. We only stayed here for 1 night. They have very good and delicious breakfast! Omelette was a hit! Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies. After a couple of hours we waited for the availability of our room We expected way better!",1
The best!! Everything about our trip was excellent! We liked the place so much we added a few extra days!! The breakfast was so good and different each day. The rooms were beautifully decorated and clean and comfortable. Slept like a baby!,1
"Had to catch a very early flight out of PHX, and this was the closest hotel we found. It actually was clean, comfortable and close to the airport enough.",1
"I was on the ground floor. The slamming doors are horrible!! Woke me up all night, I am a very sound sleeper. Then the second night, there was a wedding. Talking, screaming, doors slamming all night until 4am. Then outside my window, people were gathering and also talking all night.",1
Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city.,1
"I stayed at the Home2 Suites for the first time while in Gainesville for a University of Florida event. It is very convenient to the university. The room was very comfortable, complete with a refrigerator, dishwasher, etc. The bed was VERY comfortable. All in all, a great value.",1

"The Benson is a beautiful old hotel within walking distance to many things downtown. The staff was very professional and welcoming. The room was nicely appointed and very clean, however, it was too warm and extremely noisy with the window open. Ear plugs are provided! Can't sleep with those, so we didn't get much sleep. The bathroom was nicely updated... More",1
"Was looking for a clean place to crash for the night , had a business meeting the next day. There was an old, tenament building smell in the building. You can tell they try to keep it clean. We met some hookers outside congregating in front of the entrance.",1
"This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your awesome feedback, compliments of our hotel's location and arthitectural features. Thank you again for staying with the Hampton Inn SUites Napa, we hope to serve you again in the near future.",1
"The staff at this Comfort Inn is wonderful. They are always very accommodating with us and help us out. We've stayed here more than once but always in room 201. It's a very nice room, it's clean, and the beds are comfortable. The included breakfast is quite good for a free breakfast and my nieces love the waffles! My nieces also love their pool! It's pretty average size for a hotel but big enough for us. Marzoni's is just across the parking lot which is great for us because it is our favorite restaurant in the Altoona area.",1
"I chose this property as the site as the host hotel for my brother's wedding guests and rehearsal dinner. The rooms were fine and the staff was mostly attentive. On one of the mornings, housekeeping missed making the bed somehow. The breakfast is awful. If you ate looking for a good free breakfast this is not the place. The meeting... More",1

"Bad: There are not much things to do around apart from parks. If you look for a good restaurant, you may have to drive for 20 minutes or so. Good: Clean and comfortable room, friendly staff. It is close to Disney parks and about 20 drive to Universal parks and the airport. There is also free parks shuttle service provided.",1
"Everything from the staff, my room and the dining area was fabulous. The rates were great and I would recommend to anyone staying in the Baltimor area to stay at the Hilton",1
Bad: The eggs was nasty.,1
"We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return.",1
I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel.,1
"Bad: That we were only there for 2 nights. Good: Very spacious room, with a partial ocean view from the balcony. Rooftop pool and seating looked amazing. Staff were very friendly, and food was excellent. Eric's 'Honey Jalapeno Ginger Margaritas' were superb!",1
"We checked in on April 29-30 2016 and were looking to enjoy a free breakfast as listed on the website for this property.

"Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast. Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults. From arcades, bowling alleys, and cheap gambling. A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip. Also It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining. A very good choice in my opinion!",1
"Part of a roadtrip through USA. Staff here are very helpful and the hotel is modern and well kept. The location is a little a way out of town, but this is reflected in the price.",1
WE had an outstanding time enjoying the beauty of this resort and all the activities. Our rooms were furnished with interesting and New Hampshire like settings. The staff was very accommodating and we enjoyed the welcome wine reception.,1
"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!",1
"Nice room, convenient kitchenette, great breakfast. A good stop-off for travelers.",1
The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.,1
There were a lot of people staying there during my stay but the hotel was quiet at night. The couch was getting a little worn and the air conditioning was quiet. The internet worked good. It was an easy trip into Speedway.,1

"Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015. We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6.The Motel 6 is excellent value for money! Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom. Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside...Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth. Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am. That is very easy when you arrive 'jet laged' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -)Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum, the Olypic parc etc by foot.They also have a car park at site at no extra cost, so that was also very easy to park our rental car there.Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff. I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta!",1
"I would definitely stay at the Aria again. The Aria needs to hire more more Check-in staff from 5PM - 7PM. We had to wait at least 15 minutes to check-in, I felt like I was at an Airport Ticket Counter",1
The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view. The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing. Checking in at the tower suites was fantastic. No line ups and very friendly staff. Overall the Hotel is fantastic. Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing. Good central location as well.,1
I stayed there with our team. Beds were average. Shower was good. Housekeeping staff seemed OK. We stayed with our team. All of the staff didn't know that we are staying there and we need separate room too eat etc. So we ended up in lobby eating dinner etc. Breakfast was decent and the room was always setup. The staff... More,1
"The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.",0
"Great location with lots to do. The staff and service were A+. Facilities were very accommodating with BBQ's, fire pits, and several areas to just relax. Beach is accessible, although the stairs a slightly steep. We will definitely go back!",1

"Great dining, great amenities, comfy room I was super happy with my experience and I'll definitely be back, if not for personal travel then definitely for work events. Very much looking forward to returning.",1
"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure.",0
Nice pillows and TV. That's about all I have. Who much must I type,1
"This hotel room was great! Just like home. Full Kitchen, living room, private bedroom, large bathroom",1
Better than expected for the price point. The breakfast that was provided offered many choices.,1
"This hotel is simply outstanding and we could not fault it.

"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon.",1
"This hotel gave me Room 232 next to the ice machine and the elevator. I stayed 2 nights, a Wednesday and a Thursday. The room was pretty clean. The room was dark with insufficient electric lighting.

On your next visit, please see a property leader to discuss how we can make your next visit a five-star review.",1
"My friend and I stayed at the Pearl 4 nights, it was a return visit. January 27th-31st. The rooms are large, clean and have internet access.The location is excellent walking distance to the beach,restaurants and shopping and the best part is the price very resonable.",1
"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!",1
"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away.",1

"Very very good location. This hotel is literally across the street from the Tennessee aquarium. We easily walked to dinner from the hotel, then also walked later in the evening to the movie theater a block over. While we didn't shop, it appeared that there was shopping nearby for those who want to. Very nice accommodations. Comfy bed, hot shower,... More",1

But if I am cold,... More",1
"The name inn really does not represent them and devalues their name. Resort would probably fit better because of all the amenities and all that they have to offer. We were married there in 2012 and stayed there multiple times since 2010, so maybe we are biased)",1
"Very satisfied. I had a wonderful experience in the 4 days that I staid in the Hotel. Breakfast was good and satisfied, the fact that it was free. Clean room was good and satisfied with my stay A/C at the room worked exceptionally good",1
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Antonio! The room was so spacious and comfortable to be in. Large living area with comfortable couch and big tv. Breakfast was great with plenty of options to choose from. The front desk staff and maintenance/cleaning people were so friendly and kind. My husband and I were very pleased with our stay! Thank you!,1
Bad: Carpet Breakfast was starting to be boring at the end.,1
"This was a hotel we book because we had a small pet. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was a little dated and needs some TLC however, it was comfortable and served our purpose.",1
"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat.",1
Love this hotel. Beautiful lobby and very good restaurants. The coffee in the room was delicious and the maker easy to use-sometimes one must move the coffee maker etc... The best part of the trip is that the hotel is quiet. I couldn't hear other doors in my hallway banging closed.,1
"The room, the beds, the food and the help at this hotel is nothing short of perfect without including a lot of extras my husband and I don't need. The location is close to everything and the building is historical and very well kept. Could not ask for a more homey place to stay.",1
"Bad: Walls are very thin, be prepared to hear your neighbors.",1
Looking for a place to stay while in the Oklahoma City area---you couldn't do much more in Moore than to choose the Best Western motel Plus. It is in the middle between OKC Norman and in the midst of most name brand eateries. The staff was very friendly Helpful most helpful.,1
"I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price.",1
"Hotel staff is extremely nice. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet. I would recommend having non-pork items available on the line (turkey bacon/sausage or even veggie patties). Room on the small side, but valued for the rate. Had a family of ants visit - reported to the desk and was taken care of. Dockside Grill for evening dinner was good. I would... More",1
My husband and I along with 2 other couples booked a night at the Lyttleton Inn for convenience purposes. We were going to a local music venue and live a little over an hour away. We decided to make a night of it and found The Lyttleton Inn. It was an unexpected surprise. A quaint New England Inn furnished with... More,1
"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service.

"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area.",1
it was nice went to Grants farm and the zoo and the hotel was swim and had lunch by the pool.,1
"The hotel was very clean, staff was amazing and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this to a family or friend. Yes, if I'm in the area I would love to stay here again. Great facility",1
"The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways.",1
This is a very clean hotel with spacious rooms in a beautiful scenic locale. They offer a full hot breakfast and have coffee available 24/7 and the rates are very reasonable. My only gripe would be that they should have more than one elevator for as large as this hotel is. A lot of people opted to take the stairs.,1
This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money.,1
"Hotel is very clean, great staff, great service. Restaurant has good food. Outside fire-pit is fun. Lots of amenities. Free wifi and Good location, near a lot of restaurants, antique shops and things to do.",1
The hotel stay was great other then check in. The girl at check in was very rude which started off the stay their unpleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was great.,1
"Bad: The staff was snide and grumpy. Good: The large bathroom, the silly decor",1
"This morning I called to inquire about the availability for a five night stay wanting to give this property another chance from a previous unpleasant experience. A couple of months ago, I called to inquire about a stay and had experienced poor customer service. At that time, I wrote it off as perhaps the representative was having a bad day.... More",0
"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More",1
This is the second time I have stayed here. The rooms are large and we had two double beds in ours. I did not use the pool but there were people in it all the time. we had to call down for towels and an extra blanket.,1
"The hotel may look a little run down at night, but after seeing it during the day it looks fine. I would probably suggest getting a cabin rather than hotel room. We got one of their cabins that was right beside the river. It was very pretty and relaxing. The cabin was nice and I felt comfortable there. This motel... More",1
The hotel was decent and affordable. The info for restaurants in the area was very helpful. We went to a local spot which was more pleasant and less crowded. Very close to the intersate.,1
"A little hard to get to, nothing in the immediate area - like within walking distance. A little old and outdated looking.",0
This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.,1
Stopped here for an overnight traveling through Atlanta. The desk clerks at night were excellent. I had a problem turning my TV on - the lady at the desk came to my room to set it up. Sign in the lobby indicates they are going to start renovations soon-which are much needed - hotel was dated.,1
"My family and I went to Windham mountain for 4 days and just wanted a simple place to sleep. The owners were very nice and even provide a simple (think cereal and coffee), breakfast. The rooms were simple and clean and just what we needed. The only drawback was that the walls are very thin and you can hear conversations... More",1
"We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families. All rooms are two room suites which gives parents an opportunity to separate awhile from children. All rooms have a view of the Chesapeake Bay and balconies.",1
Staff were exceptionally friendly throughout the resort and the room was beautiful and very comfortable - felt like I was in a 5 star resort. Pools were gorgeous but found the restaurants were a little overpriced for me.,1
Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.,0
"Our room was really comfortable and cozy. The hotel is in the middle of the historic downtown, close to the Old Slave Mart Museum, Waterfront Park, St. Michael Church etc. Good restaurant in the hotel or across the street.",1
"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees.",1
"I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome! Thank's so much for choosing Aloft NOLA for your needs, we hope you'll be back again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Absolutely like the laminate floors in the rooms instead of carpeting. You can sense clean instead of what can be in carpeting. Rooms are pretty standard fare but not cramped. Fairly quiet area - off the interstate a slight distance but not out of the way with good connecting north south state highways. Staff did everything to make the stay... More,1
"I was involved in setting up reservations for a group at this hotel, direct bill was required as well as particular room requests.

"The staff were especially helpful and nice. I showed up at one in the morning and still received a courteous reception. Breakfast in the morning was good as far as continental's go, and the bed was quite comfortable with fresh soft sheets.",1
"I am finally getting around to writing this review after staying last year. This resort is AMAZING - we had such a great time and were very sorry to leave.

As I say in my other reviews of beach motels... we stay in these because we like to save money. We don't spend a huge amount of time in the rooms so a little wear and tear is not a huge deal to us. We checked in without a problem and the staff was friendly. They do require a 20... More,1

More",1
We stopped over here on our way to Florida. Very pleasant experience and close to downtown historic district. We enjoyed our 1 night stay.,1
"The hotel is very basic but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. After staying at other Best Western hotels, this hotel could include many more amenties. The hotel had an odor that was not pleasing, 1 of 2 elavators was out of service. Breakfast items were plentiful but the staff could not keep up during peak times and the buffet area got very messy. The front desk service employees were helpful and polite. I would not go back to this hotel inspite of the good price.",1
"While making coffee one morning and trying to iron a shirt, the circuit tripped. The sad part was that the GFI was at the END of the electrical run, not the beginning, so I had to call down to the front desk and wait for someone to reset the circuit at the electrical panel. I shouldn't have blown in the first place, but it also should be re-wired properly.",1
"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!",1
"This is a terrific hotel. I make it a point to stay here every trip to San Diego. The grounds are beautiful and the amenities are great! Ask about the PG program. The PG lounge is awesome! The staff is eager to help in any way,",1
"We were in the area at another hotel which we found was under construction, frustrated and upset, we called Seacrest and were able to book a room last minute.

"Bad: I thought the bathroom was a bit small for the space and the physical appearance could have been a bit more modern and sharp. Good: I liked the spacious nature of the room. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were super attentive, helpful and friendly",1
Had a one night stop in Yuma and this hotel is conveniently located. Nice clean lobby and very helpful front staff. Pool was clean and nice size gym. I did not eat at the hotel but did sit up at the bar and very nice bartender. Rooms were comfortable and clean. I would stay at this hotel again.,1
"The Continental breakfast was wonderful, like a buffet. Even though it was a bit of a distance from Washington D. C. there was a shuttle to the metro station that goes into the city. I was not happy with the help from the desk personel and the room did have an odor. the hotel was clean.",1
"This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there.",1
"This place is very nice and clean. The location can't be beat, it's within walking distance to everything in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a really enjoyable stay and will return again.",1
"My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again.",1
Good: Love everything about my stay,1
"Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.",1
The overall hotel it self was was not bad. Room was average from what we've heard about small rooms in Hawaii. We had a private balcony which was nice. There included breakfast could be better.

"I have nothing but praise, particularly for the night check-in clerk. I believe Alina was her name. She took great care of me, even through a confusing situation of MY own making. She was efficient, kind, professional and personable. The room was very basic--not posh by any means--but it was clean and had everything I needed including a great bed.... More",1
Best hotel breakfast I have ever encountered.,1
"This hotel is not on the beach ( 10 minute walk away ) but overlooks the canal which runs parallel to the beach, 2 blocks back. Initial reaction to this hotel was that it was a bit basic, small bathroom, and probably could do with a makeover. However, when we settled in, our impressions changed and by the time we... More",1
My sister and I have been coming to Sanibel once or twice a year now for several years. At first we tried some other hotels but Sanibel Inn is now our only choice. It is a short walk to the beach. The rooms are neat and tidy. I love the little balcony where we have time to enjoy the sound... More,1
"I run an event at Bedford Village every summer and this motel is my go-to favorite. It's clean, convenient (I usually get a room where I can park right outside the door) and the staff are always friendly and helpful. If you want a bubbling fish tank wall and a lot of fake cherry wood, this isn't your place. But... More",1
"Really great hotel, good breakfast buffet and I loved the fact they had a stairway going down to the beach area... And the view of the Ocean was fantastic. The only unfortunate thing was the weather wasn't in our favor to enjoy the hot tub and fire pits. I'll be back",1
"We were there for only two nights, but we were extremely pleased. The meeting halls for our conference were great, our room was wonderfully comfortable, clean, and well-furnished, and most importantly the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as guests tops that of any other hotel we've ever stayed at. This hotel is right at a metro station for two lines that go straight into the downtown area, and is only 3 minutes from the airport. It's also connected to a wonderful mall. In all, the only word to describe the experience is, well, perfect!",1
"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.",1
"Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors.",1
I have stayed many times over the past several years at this classic hotel. The service from the front desk to the room attendants to the bartenders are top notch.

"Great hotel, well kept but the room had some strange bad smell, no big deal. Only problem we had a baby with us and had requested a crib at least five days before, and when we got there they said they did not have any available, not safe at all to sleep with the baby in our bed. Otherwise the rest was ok.",1
"No need to look anywhere else when staying in Louisville! For the price, proximity to YUM Center and the beautiful views of the river, it's the best deal going! Cafe Magnolia (2nd floor) is a great casual restaurant. Thelma's Deli is perfect for fruit, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast biscuits, etc.",1
"We enjoyed our 2 days in Tarpen Springs, the hotel was near to the Sponge ward and shopping.",1
for the money this is a very nice hotel. we only stayed one day so we didn't have to deal with cleaning service but the room was clean. only issue is the hours the pool is open. doesn't open till 5pm during the work week.,1
"We paid for a 150.00 room but put in a room which is 75.00. I checked the rooms because my sister stayed in the 75.00 room which is exactly the same as ours. We were ripped off. The two beds in room are very small, my husband and I couldn't sleep on the same bed. One of us slept on the couch which was uncomfortable too. No more!!!",1
"I have stayed in this hotel twice in the last year. I had a great experience both times. The suites are very clean and the beds are very comfortable.

Cleanliness of the hotel was spot on. The staff at check in was very helpful. The room was very large and could accommodate my family with comfort and ease. A great stay and a great value.,1
"Staff was very nice, especially the bartender on Friday night. We dined at the bar. The Cobb salad was incredible. Best grilled chicken I have had in a while. Breakfast was a little pricey, but the service by Theresa was excellent. We were in room 532 we could hear some noise from adjoining rooms. Hotel is within walking distance... More",1
"We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices.",1
Bad: no. Good: very good,1
Good location and facilities. One thing that was a little negative was that the room smelled a little. Perhaps from people cooking Had a nice little exercise room and the internet was amazingly fast!!! Overall a good experience!!,1

"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Came for a weekend with a child. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was stocked and ready. Pool area was clean and the rooms were very nice. Would definitely recommend. Had no complaints at all. They are located a little off the beaten path but it was nice and quiet.,1

Good: The receptionist Sean was excellent and informative. Housekeeping are good.,1
"Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.",1
No complaints,1
While the dcor (lobby/breakfast area) may seem a bit different....don't let that put you off. They have a Great variety of Breakfast foods. It is a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Check in and check out was easy is typical for La Quinta's.,1

Bad: the carpet is damm dirty. Good: It feels like hotel not like any other hotel in Vegas,1
"Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin.",1
Once we finally found it we enjoyed the stay. Your sign is hidden behind Applebees and we couldn't find it without stopping and asking for directions. We got there early and our room was ready at 11 so we were able to check in right away. Room was really quiet and the tv was a good size. Will stay there again.,1
"Hotel was clean and comfortable, quiet, beds were comfortable with a restaurant within walking distance of the hotel. Staff was very helpful, breakfast was good. Close to the interstate for easy access to hotel.",1
Close enough to the harbor or be an easy walk. Near a movie theatre and an ice cream store. Very convenient.,1
"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.",1
"I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well.",1
"Staff is friendly, Hotel is Clean and very comfortable. They offer breakfast and chocolate chip cookies! What more do you need. This place has a fitness center and a pool. I stay here for business and I never choose another hotel. Would Highly Recommend.",1
I'm on the a lot road and always staying in hotels. This hotel has always been one of my favorites ever since I stayed there 5 years ago. The staff is excellent!

They even let us leave our car here for three weeks to save on parking at airport. There is a movie theater across the road and some good restraints available in the neighborhood.",1
"Quirky but clean and comfortable. No it's not a five star but resort but it doesn't pretend that it is, it's actually better because it has character and fits in perfectly with the Folly scene (which is quickly disappearing).",1
"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general. We were in town to see the Tigers and White Sox play, and the hotel shuttled us all around Detroit so that we didn't have to get in our car at all. They let us check in 3 hours early, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, and... More",1
"The hotel was centrally located to where I needed to be. It is about 10-15 minutes from the Scranton Wilkes-Barre airport. The hotel entrance is a bit hidden from the main road. You must make a sharp turn then go up an incline before you see the main building and parking lot. Leaving, use caution as you must turn onto... More",1
"Bad: Daily waiting lines for the elevators. Good: Excellent spacy suite, location and spa facilities (although no sauna)",1
"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out.",1
It was a great stay the only problem is that Hotels.com booked and charged me for two rooms. I only reserved one room. I am still waiting for Hotels.com to acknowledge their mistake and refund my account.,1

Will definitely return as this suite had everything I needed and more!,1
Great location. A lot of hidden fee's but still a better bargain than most.,1
Close to shopping and restaurants. Very friendly staff,1
Bad: Used my debit card to pay for room.. Normally charges are taken out day you leave but they took them out day I arrived then charged 76 extra just incase I broke or damaged something-they said I would get it back but it was still pended out of my account. Good: Loved the free breakfast,1
"My wife and I stayed here 3 nights. Very modern and newer hotel right in front of the beach. We walked to beach, pier, shopping, and great restaurants in the immediate area.

"Location, Location, Location.... yes. But facility definately showing aging. Parking should be included in the cost of stay. It is kind of like saying rooms are $/ night, but you have to pay to use the toilet. But with that said location could not be better.",1
"Stayed one night and it was perfect for our travel plans. The hotel is quiet, clean and up to date. The staff was friendly and efficient. Loved the bright color scheme and all the big fluffy towels in the bath. The water pressure was out of this world. The lighting a bit dim in the bathroom but overall a perfect... More",1

"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room.",1
"For us it was a fabulous location getting on rail to Cubs game and shopping for what we wanted to do. It's was easily accessible for dining as well Everyone in the hotel was very kind and were able to help with any questions we had Hello Pam D,We are glad our location made your visit to Chicago ideal for your Cubs game!

"We had stayed at the Ka'anapali Alii (which was fantastic but much more expensive) on our first trip and looked forward to this trip back to Kaanipali. Although this resort is beautiful, it is off the beaten path with not as much to do. I guess you could walk to Whaler's Village, but it's a long walk. Duke's is great,... More",1
We decided to go to Charleston for Thanksgiving weekend and had an enjoyable experience. Great location within an easy walk to all of the attractions.

"We loved the hotel and the staff. The concierges were especially helpful. It is in the best location for sightseeing and restaurants. One criticism - when I booked with your service, you told me a carriage ride and walking tour were included. The hotel staff said they never have included those extras. Hotels.com needs to straighten that out.",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Extremely friendly staff. They help you in every difficulty. You can depend on them.,1

Bad: I couldn't understand why the fan constantly as if it never reached the desired temperature.Also that nightly service fee of 14.95 is a rip-off.,1
Excellent hotel with a very up-market feel in a great location. Right on Ocean Drive but quite.,1
I stayed here for 1 night and discovered bed bugs in the morning. My back was covered in bites and there were multiple bugs under my pillow. I immediately raised the issue to the front desk and they could not be less concerned about the bugs. They informed me that theyve had issues with bed bugs in the past and... More,0
"I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting.",0

Bad: Within the first 15 minutes of being there we got a complaint from a neighbor for having music too loud. The speaker was not even up half way and it was 4 oclock in the afternoon on a Saturday. At the end of the night staff were rude.,1
"although the staff were very accomodating, the hotel itself was old, needed renovation. lobby was gorgeous but the rooms inconsistent. hot water takes 10 - 15 minutes to come to the tap.",0
Intuitive and Friendly staff. Hotel was clean and well managed. Early check in was made available and each item on my profile was provided upon entering my room. The continental breakfasts were amazing!,1
We asked for a handicap room. We got a room on the first floor. Not very handicap accessible. No grab bars in the bathroom. Not handicap accessible for wheelchair person. Very little room. Got the first floor. but other than that not very helpful. Front desk did not seem to care either. I undertand you cannot guarantee a room. But this was not a enjoyable experience. The restaurant was good and very accommodating.,1
"Nice rooms, very clean, comfortable and roomy place. Juan at front desk is a funny guy. Very helpful with directions on places to go and where not to go. Restaurants near the area. We stayed here for two nights so everything was easy-going.",1

Bad: Room was really expensive for what it was Location was bad - takes up to 45 mins to get into Hollywood. Good: Bed was comfortable Place was clean,1
"The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection. I vote for the location and price.",1
"I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable",0
I loved this quirky hotel and it's modern feel. Our room was very large and my husband and I appreciated the curtain that separated the king bed from the couch bed where our kids were sleeping.

The property was very nice and very clean. The rooms are a nice size and are very clean.

"This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed!

"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time.

I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty.,0

Everybody from the front desk to those that cleaned the room did a fantastic job of making our stay very enjoyable. Thanks to all of them.,1
"Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park. Room stank like feet, bathroom had stains on the wall, light fixtures nearly falling off the wall, carpets were very stained. Overall horrible hotel",0
Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed.,0
I found the Hotel up to our expectations. We had no need to interact with the help as everything was as expected. We will stay here again on our trips to the East coast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going across route I 80 in Pa.,1

Only stayed here because we were visiting and I needed stay to keep GP points alive. Things can be slow and very busy when crowded (it was state spring break when we went).

"This hotel is undergoing extensive renovation. It is currently filled with the sounds of hammering and the unrenovated sections are seriously outdated. We had a leaky air conditioner in the room which swamped the carpeting. I used four towels to mop up one section. The management was attentive to repairing the AC, but we had a fan running for two days to try to dry out the carpet. I'm sure this will be a great place once the renovations are complete.",1
"Reason for stay was to catch flight early am. Location is excellent to airport. Shuttle service efficient, although was somewhat crowded leaving. Return was very good. Also, hotel is close to restaurant I love to visit. Overall very good experience!",1
We had an amazing experience. The hotel was very close to everything and every single employee had excellent customer service. Will definitely go back.,1
Good: Staff is very nice.,1
We use this motel twice per year for an AKC hunt test. We book several rooms for judges and guests. We have never been disappointed with the amenities or the staff. This motel is very pet friendly which is extremely important to us!,1
Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.,1
"I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged.",1
"There are only 3 hotels in Mesquite that take dogs, I have stayed at one of the others.

"We made a last minute reservation because of location and price (which at 157 a night wasn't really a bargain) for this hotel. The location is great, you can walk to some shops and eateries. It is a short drive or bike ride to the beach which is nice. Our first room had a faulty air conditioner and the room was super musty. That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so. Other than the staff, I probably wouldn't stay here again...",1
Couldn't be nicer!!! Front desk was courtesy at check in. Clean rooms no bed so comfortable. Front desk called 10 mins after check in to make sure everything was ok. Fresh and nice breakfast selection.,1
I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel. The hotel offered a very small breakfast area....enough for maybe 6 people. Not what was pictured. Limited parking due to the bar and many Christmas parties.,1

I got this room for my wife to have a little alone time and even though I did not stay the nights with her I did join her for breakfast and did spend time with her in the room.

Easy to get to. Room was clean and the staff was friendly.

The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.,1

"Bad: Some of the front desk staff came off a bit rude. This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful.",1
"I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.",0

"The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager",1

"Overall I had a great stay at this hotel. I was traveling alone with three children four years old and younger and needed a place to overnight that was safe, affordable and comfortable. The room was a great size, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. We arrived after midnight and the hostess that greeted us was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was nice and the pool area looked amazing though sadly we had no time to enjoy it. Only negative I had with this stay is that I requested a crib for the night and it was not set up when we got into the room. Unfortunately we checked in so late that although there was a crib available for the front desk to provide one, were no linens for it. Since I had a portable one in my car this wasn't a big deal for me (other than an extra trip out to the parking lot).",1

This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time.

However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered.",0
"The sea captain has it all, it is the friendliest place I have ever had the good fortune to visit. My self and my family will be returning for the third year in a row this September.

"Really nice place to stop for the night! Very clean, very friendly staff, rooms are nice size with comfortable beds and updated bathrooms. Breakfast consisted of a waffle maker, cereal, fresh fruit, toast, bagels, hard boiled eggs, all presented very well. Attendants kept everything supplied and tables wiped cleaned. Very nice place!",1
"I visited this location in October 2015 as this was our state conference site. I stayed in room 340, which is a King Suite City-View room. Check in was very quick and professionally handled (they had 3 employees at the guest services desk). Very spacious room, has microwave, mini-refrigerator, patio with chairs--could easily fit a family in this room. Everything... More",1
"Breakfast could be better by adding few more things like raisin, walnut, variety to fruits, ready oatmeal (not instant oatmeal) It was clean and breakfast was good",1
"The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings.",0
"The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, and the property well maintained, but it was the friendly, warm-hearted proprietor who made this place special. I would recommend this motel as not only a good value but as a place with an unusually pleasant atmosphere. In addition, we were delighted to find that the Lasalle Big Blue Stem Trail was... More",1
This was a very clean nice place to stay and it is very close to the grand ole opry as well as downtown Nashville. I would recomend staying here if you do not mind a short drive to downtown and an easy cab ride to Opryland. There are several nice places to eat in the area as well.,1
"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,",1
"We stay here every time we visit Palestine. The pool is warm and salt-filtered, so no chlorine burning eyes. We love making hot waffles at the complimentary hot breakfast. The staff are friendly, smart, and helpful. The beds are soft and cozy. Everything is spotlessly clean. You just couldn't ask for anything more.",1
"Freddy, Jake, Ozzy, and Ally were very good at keeping my friends and I satisfied while we enjoyed the gorgeous view here at the beach. They were ready to work and very enthusiastic during service! I definitely will be coming back and it was an amazing day at the beach!",1
"I wasn't thrilled about the exterior corridors.. my room was FREEZING, smelled of dog, and there were multiple hairs all over the tub... The staff was friendly. Alright stay, wouldn't be my first choice.",1
We stayed at this location one night pre cruise. The air port shuttle was free and arrived fairly quickly. The check in was fast and the staff friendly. The room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was good with some hot foods. They provided a shuttle to the cruise port for a nominal fee. And we were able to get a... More,1
"The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange.",0

"This hotel has an amazing staff from the GM, to the front desk, down to the breakfast and cleaning crew. My king suite was spacious and very clean!!

"I traveled 38 hours (2,592.3 miles) to this hotel. True indeed it is a nice hotel but management (Danielle or Daniella) is so unprofessional, inconsiderate, insensible, heartless, undiplomatic, shameless person.

"Stayed for one night before flight. Clean, big rooms, friendly staff. Great beds and also have a sofa and wet bar area along with a small fridge. Includes breakfast and a shuttle to and from airport. The only negative was the shower-needs updating, tired looking.",1
Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays.,1
"This hotel is clean, cozy and cheap. It is a small hotel in a small city. Everything was in good working order and my bed was comfortable. The staff is very friendly and I received my key in less than 2 minutes ! Great after a long, long flight. I recommend.",1
Bad: Shuttle services to the strip because older people may have problems with feet problems which I do. Good: Everything,1
"It is obvious that this HIE takes great pride in their establishment and it shows in all the little things that they do. We checked in late Friday evening and were warmly and expertly greeted, / Comfortable rooms/ great breakfast.",1
"Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Please let us know when you want another getaway as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge",1
My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
"We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria. We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best-- perfect location, incredible restaurants, wonderful pool and fitness areas... And don't forget the smell when you enter the lobby-- I'm pretty convinced that's what Heaven smells like!",1
Stayed there with the kids (6 of us total). Room was spacious and pull out couch was wonderful. Nice kitchen type area with frig and sink. Would choose again.,1
"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place.",0
"Special thank you to Casey Martin, Chaunee, Antonio, Lee, and everyone else who made our stay so great! Casey was especially awesome helping us plan events at the hotel and personally catering to every need we had while there!",1

"Friendly staff, very helpful, clean rooms. Metro across the street (Blue line 2 stops to Arlington, Yellow line 3 stops to monuments/museums). Nice if you want to stay outside the main sightseeing area. Would stay again.",1
"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.",1
"We had a very large room, large table, large TV with many channels but no HD, fridge, microwave, good AC, nice furniture, and a small bathroom with limited counter space. Staff was very friendly.

This property is nice. It is located very close to downtown and for the most part is easy to get to and from. They do have a strange parking arrangement with a garage across the street.

"Great location, super friendly well groomed professional staff, clean facility. Hands down the best hotel in town. Prices at the restaurant are reasonable. They have amazing food too. They have a really nice pool for the kids that is always clean. My kids love staying here.",1
Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. .,0

Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,0
One of the best hotels in Indy. We have been using this hotel for 10 years. Every time we are in Indy. You will enjoy it. Never had a bad time. The staff and food and building are clean sweet and good.,1

It was ok. Was not worth the price but we waited til the last minute to book and that's what you get.,1
"We love staying at this hotel. It's close to a casino, food and has a great pool/spa for the kids. We choose to have weekend fun nights here - it's close to outdoor activities that we enjoy and the town of Lacy is super cute.",1
"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)",1

"Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3! The food we brought along for our Coast Guard son survived! The hotel staff was amazing, helpful and courteous. The room was spotless, NO BED BUGS!!. The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base. Thank you so much for making our stay in Suffolk, Virginia. We will certainly be staying there in June when our son graduates A school! Thank you!",1

"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend.",1
"This hotel is perfect for a short stay. It's really close to the interstate, they have a pool, there's ample parking and eateries close by (you could walk) to get a quick bite to eat.

The room was very clean and you can't beat the location. The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life. You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter.,1

"The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback.

This hotel has a very strange layout and my room and the hallway smelled mildewy. But it seemed very clean otherwise and the staff was very nice. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The free shuttle to the Metro turned out to cost 10 not sure if the driver and the hotel have that understanding or not.,1

The Grand Hyatt's grounds are beautiful. We were assigned to a dazzling and spacious suite. The reason I didn't assign 5 stars is the shower was absolutely horrid.

Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .,0
"Bad: Hotel should be in the motel category considering the room we've got. We had cockroaches in the bathroom and the small fridge was very noisy. Very basic breakfast canned food, nothing fresh. Definitely, it doesn't worth the price per night. Good: Friendly staff",0
"Bad: 195 a night (including resort fee) is expensive but it is Miami and all hotels seem to be this much, I cant fault the hotel so its a case of pay up and smile!. Good: Excellent location at the quiet end of Ocean Drive but still within walking distance of bars and restaurants, beach, shops and local buses. Very comfy beds, beach towels and chairs available for use. Free glass of wine on an evening was a nice touch.",1
"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone.",0
"Bad: Room size, bed size and breakfast. Good: Location is very good",1
Great place to stay.. Clean comfortable friendly great bed.. Stayed two nights slept great... Friendly service.. good staff.. Only wish they had cookware and dinnerware in the rooms... Can't complain about a nice place..,1
"Spotless room, comfortable bed, free wi fi, caring and efficient staff. Well located, near the downtown area, close to main highways and wineries. Plenty of parking, elevator to 2nd and third floors, Coffee and tea in room, Denny's restaurant next door.Stan, We are glad you had a great stay. Clean rooms, comfortable bed and great service is what we strive for. Come back and see as again.",1
Bad: i didnt like that there was no poker room and the casino was not 24/7. Good: I liked the price and value for money,1
Food is amazing. The staff will do everything to accommodate your party. Love the quaint place. Highly recommend.,1
"Very comfortable and relaxing.... But, most of all the quietness and friendliness of the employees.",1
"Overall hotel looks nice on outside. Bed was comfy, room was pretty clean. Room was a half done remodel. They painted and replaced a lot but left the dingy old doors and bad tile. You could tell this was a remodel on a budget.",1
"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries",1
"I did not stay in the room a whole lot as I was in town for a conference. My husband, however, came with me and spent most of the day in the room while I was at my conference. He was not impressed with the wifi strength, intermittent moments of loud guests and lack of a microwave in the room. Other than that we were pleased with the comfort of the room in general.",1
"We couldn't be happier with our stay at Hyatt House Seattle. The front desk was so accommodating, they had recommendations for restaurants things to do, they also helped us if we needed directions to places we also wanted to visit. There was also a shuttle that we relied on to get us around, it was great! Thank you Hyatt... More",1
"We only stayed for one night, but I think would have been very happy had we needed a longer stay. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The lobby area and our room was very clean. While we didn't use the kitchen area because our stay was short and we were out of town for most of the day, everything... More",1
This hotel serves its purpose. We stayed here when visiting Phoenix for spring training. Most hotels were booked and very expensive. This was a bit out of the way but worth the savings. Room was updated and clean. Fabian at the front desk was great!,1
All aspects of stay were very positive. I would definitely stay there again. Staff was very pleasant and room was very clean. Breakfast was very good and staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel had easy access to interstate and a nice selection of dining options.,1
We booked this stay using Marriott points so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. The evening staff were very gracious. We were booked for the morning shuttle and paid to leave our car in the lot rather than park at the airport. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a Ruby Tuesday across... More,1
"We stayed here two nights in mid-September. We found the motel clean, quiet and restful. Breakfast was minimal, but there was plenty to keep us until our noon meal. The only complaint we have is that parking is a real problem in that there is not enough parking. The best recommendation will be that we will stay again when we... More",1
"This place does it right on the details that can be so frustrating for travelers. It's clean, well-cared-for, has good wifi and plenty of outlets for battery chargers, laptops and phones. The staff is helpful and friendly, too. It's also one of the few places a stayed at during a seven-week tour of the Southwest where the towels weren't paper... More",1
"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.",0

"PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, particularly the view from your room! We love the changes that have been taking place in the South Lake Union neighborhood, particularly now that the roadwork is complete. I did want to share that while we do offer room-delivery for dinner, our breakfast is only available in the Bistro. However we are happy to package anything on the menu to-go if needed!We hope you will choose our hotel again next time your travels bring you to Seattle.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor",1
wonderful staff breakfast lady was wonderful sunday 9/13) room needs refrigerator noise guests on the floor,1
Stayed here for a night on a stop over in Boston. The hotel was very clean and easy to find plus close to a load of restaurants and bars. When I arrived there seemed like there was a party going on in the hotel bar which made me think I was in for a loud and uncomfortable night. However once... More,1
"Opted to stay here and commute to downtown for my meetings to save on hotel expenses of the downtown hotels. If you are willing to do that, it works. hotel has basic amenities, nothing more. It's basically a highrise motel...rooms are all suites with stove, microwave,etc. 10-15 minute walk to metro. Shuttle operates only on weekdays.",1
"Staff made our stay nice when making the reservation with told him that handcap.was needed didn't get that from them, but when got to hotel ,the staff made it for us",1
"The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful in planning downtown activities. The location is not great, we didn't have a pretty view of anything from our room, but it was still only a quick $10 cab ride to downtown.",1
"We are regular Hyatt customers and are loyal because of the consistent quality and service. While everyone here is very nice, the pool is not kept up and the TV reception is TERRIBLE. It is August and our granddaughter wants to swim. The pool is cloudy, full of leaves and very uninviting. Breakfast was also disappointing...powdered eggs and out of... More",0
"nasty rude man at desk. dark, old, smelly room on back side of motel! Pictures on trip advisor can't be of room 170. Checked in but told them I couldn't stay there.

"We rented a two bedroom suite, as Florida residents. This was a very clean and well laid out for our family trip. The bedrooms were split to reach side of the common area, one being a king with hot tub and big bathroom. The other side had two queen beds with a second bath and we ordered a crib, while... More",1
Everything was perfect and the staff was incredibly helpful. The property was clean and the pools were sparkling!! Anthony at the pool hut went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Thanks Anthony!,1
Stop over prior to a trip to Orlando. Convenient. Airport shuttle big plus,1
The staff was really nice they allowed me to early check in and also to leave my bags after stay. Very professional and friendly,1
"every was pleasent and helpful. clean room, the door could of used a some oil really noisy",1
"The Aria has it all!! It's large, bright, clean, has an amazing swimming pool area plus a gorgeous spa!! We had an amazing Thai meal which was lovely. The hotel is close by to everything and has a tram to other hotels too. When we come back to Vegas we will stay here again!!",1
"Simple lobby, no luxury here. CLEAN and all the basics are here. We got a suite because we were a party of 3... so we had 2 large separate rooms... one with a fold-out sofa and kitchen (bar/microwave/fridg/coffee/sink)... the other with a big bath/jacuzzi, heated towel rack/separate glass shower and king bed. Some construction noise in the morning, but not... More",1
Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.,1
"Hotel staff excellent. Breakfast area was converted guest room , which did not accommodate guest . No place to sit , so we left.",1
"Somewhat updated, nice fireplace and clean. We booked a king with a Jacuzzi tub and river view. We got everything however there was no patio or balcony for us to sit on to see the river, in fact there wasn't a door leading out to the river, we could only see it from a window. Someone turned off the fridge... More",1
"The hotel is nice and we have a great room. Lobby is very inviting. The people at this hotel are very friendly especially Bethlehem at the Starwood club. What I have really notice is a lack of personnel. I think there are not enough employees for the size of the establishment. There has never been anyone outside for valet parking,... More",1
I really like this hotel. The staff is friendly helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is quiet and allows for a great nights sleep. For the price you can't beat it. As a female on business alone I felt safe in this hotel. The lobby is bright and always staffed.,1
Le stanze avrebbero bisogno di una ristrutturazione. Location strategica Colazione nella media,1
This hotel definitely needs renovations. Up grades!!!,1
Bad: They don't even offer you some water or a complementary drink or fruit. Comparing to the charges.,1
Bad: needs to be updated a bit forsure. Good: i like that they upgraded our room for one night the beds were very comfy and staff were great and we felt very safe after what happened,1
"The front desk staff was very pleasant and and helpful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast, internet worked well, and the room was clean but a little on the small size with the cramped sink area. It would be nice if maintenance adjusted the door checks as we grew quite annoyed with other guests that kept letting their doors slam.",1
We stayed at this Inn for 2 days for a family wedding. The stay was very pleasant and the staff went out of their way to take care of this large party. We came from many states and I believe all were treated very well. Would definitely return to this Inn when back in this area.,1
"Was apprehensive at first. The rate was fantastic. After my husband inspected our room and discovered the beds were brand new and very comfy very clean, we took it. It was the only oceanfront room available at 10pm at night. Glad we stayed. Pool was nice beds very comfy. Balconies were great and oceanfront view is better than at most... More",1
This is a good place to stay if you do not need to be within walking distance of downtown. Quite despite closeness to I-79. Good family restaurant next door. Easy access to Interstate.Room was small but adequate. Shower definitely for one at a time. Staff very pleasant. Cookies at front desk in the evenings were nice.,1
"Drury always delivers a good room and usually a great complimentary dinner and breakfast. The room was exactly what we expected - perfect, what you'd expect from a 4-star hotel. Note: this is priced at a 3-star level. Great value! The dinner/breakfast were satisfactory, but maybe not up to par with other Drury Inns we've stayed at. We ended up... More",1
"Bad: Dirty, tiny bathroom and no pool. Good: Prime rib meal deal at Roma's",0
"The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!",1
the only negative comment i have is that thr room service breakfast waas not very good at all. other than that our stay was excellent and i would recommend it to everyone staying in the area.,1
The only thing about this hotel is that the staff is very pleasant. The rooms are clean but very dingy feeling. Bathroom was the same. Nothing to impressive about this comfort suites. The price was way overpriced for the what I had expected.,1
"The hotel is in a good convenient area. It was clean. I made a reservation for 2 nights and they neglected to tell me that the check out time was 11am. I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that ""SHE TOLD ME"" the check out time. I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day.",1
"Definitely the location is there best attribute! , and staff are pleasant . However, As long as you do not end up in a room next to the elevator.( a lot of noise) Also at some point the AC was so loud You feel as if you are in Engine room, As long as you don't need Wi Fi( available... More",1
"Besides the outrageous price and refusal to give a AAA discount because they were at quota for the day, the sheet on the king bed was too small and came off around the corners multiple times during the night. When the sheet came off, it revealed some type of thin covering over the mattress that was very dirty. I would... More",0
"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
"A good room at a good rate. Ive seen better breakfast, but I have seen a lot worse. There is plenty of parking, security seems good and the bed was comfortable.",1
"the lobby must be the first place they renovated and it looks great but I stayed on 6 floor and everything in it was old and smelled weird, elevator squeaked all the way up not a great feeling, beds were comfy but I prefer queens",0
Bad: When I booked my room it said that that parking was included in the price I paid. But when we got there that wasn't the case!.,1
This Best Western was really great! We had a room near the back of the property the first time we stayed here in April. Our balcony looked over the running river. The water sounds were loud enough to be a soothing help when falling asleep. It is close to all the action in town and a short drive to Great... More,1

"My family and I had a great time during our stay over the Christmas Holiday. This hotel is close to Hershey Park, a really nice Mall with a movie theatre. Tons of dine-in and take-out restaurants.

From the moment we arrived to the second we left the hotel was amazing. Excellent affordability without skimping on quality. The staff team we so helpful and friendly. The hotel is situated in a central location with good access to Route 66 and The Grand Canyon We loved it,1

"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay. The pride and dedication our hotel team takes in providing exceptional customer service to our valued guests speaks strongly to our companys core values, good service at a fair price.Thank you again for taking the time to provide your feedback and we look forward to serving you again soon!",1
"Bad: The location wise was little bit tricky since it's somewhat close to a dangerous area. Good: The atmosphere and the unique design , comfortable beds and good staff",1
"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel.",1
"I enjoyed my 3-night stay here. I was given a nice room the continental breakfast was first rate. There was some trouble with one of the elevators, and the room was overly perfumed, but the staff were friendly and helpful.",1
"Was traveling. Had been driving all day. Went to this Hotel, was so very pleased. The staff at front desk was professional yet friendly. The rooms were clean and bright. The bathrooms were spotless. (im sort of picky) Complimentary coffee in Lobby. Fresh Cookie upon arrival. Comfortable beds, nice pillows. Will stay again.",1
"Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back.",1
"Bad: it's good hotel , but the price it's so expensive !!!!. Good: it's good hotel , but the price it's so expensive !!!!",1
"Stayed at the Aria on a business trip. Originally I was a little concerned about the distance from the hotel to the strip, but its not near as bad as it looks on a map. The casino is great and the location in respect to other hotels is perfect. I did not have a change to try out the restaurants... More",1
"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!",1
"We stayed here for one night on our way to Northern Virginia with our son's and their families.

My kids loved the pool. I loved the hot tub and the fitness area. My kids really enjoyed breakfast. Convenient location. Close to the beach. Great for the price. I will be back again. The rewards program is a great perk!,1
Good: The staff were courteous and our view from our room was stunning. Highly recommend,1
Loved the rooms and the views and the peacefulness of the hotel! Staff was exellent! Breakfast was great and the view from the Fuego restaurant was amazing! Also loved the spanish music playing in the lobby area (REIK) Thanks for the amazing review. We are glad you loved it. Come back soon!,1
"Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,",1

It was a comfortable bed and room. TV stations were slim. There was not hot water for the morning shower. The lobby and rooms were put together nicely.,1
We didn't get to take advantage of the outdoor amenities because it was so cold all weekend. The kids definitely want to go again when it is warm. Very friendly and helpful staff! Great location out of the way of the congestion.,1
overall i was satisfied with my stay. no body looked at me funny when i had a beer with breakfast in the hotel dining area. i would have liked to see more options for breakfast but i was not upset. the beds are soft enough for jumping also,1
It's a great place to stay and leave a car if you are flying out. The courtesy shuttle takes 10 minutes to get to O'Hare.,1
The hotel is neat and clean. Staff is friendly. It as at convenient location from the beach.,1

"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.",1
This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there. It is well located as to access to the interstates and has many good resturants close by. The Metro is close and very easy to access. I would have no qualms using this again the next time we are in the area.,1

"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",1

Great location in Vail. Located right along the river. Nice heated pool and hot tub. Great customer service.,1
"Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again.",1
July in Anaheim with no air conditioning for the first two days. First room no air so on second day moved rooms. Second room did not have working A/C either so maintenance finally changed out the entire A/C unit. No compensation for inconvenience even though Hilton advertising 100 satisfaction guarantee. Lobby is small and food is only average. Rooms are... More,1
"Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free.",0
"The hotel location is good, the employees very nice and polite, although my room was in the middle there was no noise. My only disappoinment was the parking lot, not too many at front.",1
"I recently stayed at Brewster By the Sea while visiting my parents. This is the sister property to the Captain Freeman Inn in Brewster. Our stay was perfect and I knew it would be as I've stayed at the sister property twice. Our room was lovely. A 4 poster king bed, fireplace and comfy chairs..Impeccably kept property. Breakfast was fantastic... More",1
"Very outdated rooms. Beds are hard as a rock. Continental breakfast suitable for the carb lovers, but nothing for the health conscious. Parking is good in the day, but at night, plan to do a little walking. Lot is not very well lit either. Almost every hotel in the area has had their pool open for 2 weeks, but not... More",1
The room on the ground floor smelled smoke even though it was a non smoking room. The carpets need fo be replaced. The staff were courteous. Breakfast had various choices and was well stocked.,1
A really mixed bag. Great location (by Space Needle campus) and very nice rooms. The personal service that was so lauded was absent in our case...lots of newly hired and distracted 20 somethings at the desk. The view out the back is truly horrifying ... a crack house with squatters... but no spillover to the hotel. Lots of good restaurants... More,1
Stayed here last night based on the reviews. The room (room 112) was very clean. I could be wrong but the carpet looked new. Beds were comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast was ok. The young lady that worked in this area was very nice and helpful. I would have gave this place five stars but inside the shower area... More,1
"The hotel reminded me of a boarding house. Bedrooms were tiny, as was the ensuite bathroom. There is no elevator for the hotel, so it won't accommodate handicapped guests. The breakfast room is adequate and the breakfast was bare-boned (1 type of bread, 2 types of muffins, apple, oatmeal, yoghurt, granola) but fresh, and self-serve. The hotel is older, but... More",1
"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was a good size and clean. The service at the hotel was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good but nothing special - eggs, sausage, toast, cereal, juice, etc.",1
"Small, lackluster, local owned motel literally next door to the Wall Drug and other shops and eateries on Main Street. We stayed here after spending the morning and part of the afternoon in the Badlands. It was very convenient and easy to find, however, don't expect any amenities. Our room was extremely small, old tube 20 TV that sat on... More",1
"Overall, it was okay. First it was in a sketchy neighborhood. The hotel was old but clean. The room itself was nice. Comfortable king size bed with a fold out chair. They had a decent breakfast spread. I was disappointed to find that the boiler wasn't working, after I booked the room. No discount or compensation was offered.",1
"The Mills House is in a great location in the heart of Charleston's Historic District. There is a parking garage next door w/a walkway leading right to the Mills House. Once we parked the car, we had no need to move it - everything is w/i walking distance. There are several good restaurants also w/i walking distance of The Mills House.We are very pleased w/the accessibility of Hotels.com, the easy and prompt confirmation, and knowing there is someone at hand should we need them.Thank You!",1
"Needed a place close to Middlebourne, WV for one night and didn't want to spend a lot for just a place to sleep. Had never used the so called lower end Wyndham hotels, but decided to give it a try. SURPRISE!!! Friendly staff. Asked what floor I preferred After settling in my room, phone rang.. Front desk inquiring if everything... More",1
Bad: Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade. When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation. The air condition was extreamely noisy. You can also hear all voices from the corridor and other rooms. Good: Good location. There was a comlimentary coffee machine available at the lobby. Good bed.,1
I stayed here recently while visiting family who live about 30 minutes away. What I liked about this property is that it was very clean and offered free wifi. Also its locations is very convenient if you plan on using the highway to go back and forth to Ft. Benning. Would definitely stay again!,1
Staff was friendly and professional. Hotel was clean outside and in the pool area. The room I had was clean and comfortable. I will stay there again. Great location to get food and a Walmart right next door.,1
"Room was small and kind of noisy (on highway side). It is an old hotel, so not a place to go if you like squeaky clean new stuff. However, it does have character. The breakfast was good. They give a 25 discount for guests. Valet parking only (which is necessary in that part of town) was 20 per night. Location... More",1
Stayed at the Westin for 2 nights. Staff is amazing. Location is amazing! Pebbles at the bar is super helpful and sweet!! Very knowledgeable and friendly! If I'm in the gas lamp area again I will definitely just go in and have a drink if Pebbles is working!!,1
We were passing through and always use Choice Hotels so gave this place a try. Comfortable and clean room. Did not try out breakfast since we left very early to get on the road. Staff was very friendly.,1
"Very nice hotel, not what I would call family friendly or a warm cozy lobby, but nice rooms, floor to ceiling windows and my room was spacious and a corner unit with nice views of the Tenderloin District, which I was warned is not a place to be walking after dark. However, the opposite direction is business, shopping and dining,... More",1
The lady at the front desk was a bit rude. The gentleman that was there later in the evening was a blessing.,1
"Amazing. Just 12 mins from the beach, donning, and other attractions. The breakfast was excellent!",1
"Brilliant design, great and thoughtful creative art. Service was the same. Creative bar menu, knowledgeable bartenders, especially Maxwell.

Bad: Rear and side views from the 4th floor not great. No late night lounge option to have a byob drink with friends and family. Good: Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff. Fantastic location.,1
"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance.",1
Build into to mouth of a desert canyon the hotel is structured and colored to fit in with the landscape. The two pools are wonderful as are the hiking trails and golf course. The food and cocktails are also excellent but the wine list could use some work. My favorite rooms are in the separate casitas -- more expensive but... More,1
"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!",1
"I've stayed at this motel prior but this time was quite disappointing. We checked in at 2pm, rooms still not completely ready. Had to wait for towels bedspreads till approximately 5pm this was both rooms we reserved. Bathrooms could've been cleaner. Blanket under bedspread had a hole in it. Found a large moth in the bathroom. Tissues must... More",0
Thank you Erik for taking care of my friends and I! You made sure everything was taken care of the whole day and even gave us a few places to visit while we're here! The pool was super clean along with the rooms and we have so much fun so far:) we will definitely be returning :) thanks again Erik!,1
This was a comfortable and affordable five night stay I was in Detroit for a business and I brought my family.,1
"Excellent staff, clean room, easy to check in and out. Great value. The room had wifi which worked well and a great refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and we were able to control the temperature to our liking. We had plenty of towels and washcloths, and they were nice and white and smelled clean.",1
"The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children.",1
"Needs Improvement,Our room had a odor, the toliet leak, the room was not clean that well.",0
This hotel is located in the center of the historic district and is a short drive from wine/farm country. The staff is extremely nice but lacks the polish of staff at comparable hotels in larger cities.,1
We stayed at this hotel during the weekend of our daughter's wedding. It was a convenient location to New Albany Links. The room clean and spacious. Hotel staff were very accommodating. And the shuttle to and from the wedding venue was awesome!,1
we chose this motel because it was pet friendly. Our room had 2 small queen size beds with a tiny bathroom. The bed linens and towels were a good quality. The shower needs to be replaced. The room cleaner did a very poor job especially on the rugs which was in disrepair. We did note that the motel is redoing... More,1
"The only complaints that I have is that the indoor pool was out of service for a day and half which wasn't good for the kids. Our balcony door stuck really, really bad! The light in the bathroom is also the fan so you can't be in there without the fan going. Hard to hear what is going on in the room with the loud noise running all the time.",1
Room is a little bit spendy at close to 200/night but it's a nice big room with a desk and a couch. Looks like a junior suite but it doesn't have the 2nd TV in front of the couch. If there's a negative it's that you can hear some traffic noise outside the windows. Get a higher floor to mitigate.... More,1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Beautiful and romantic,1
I want top notch service when I travel or go out on the town. This place fulfill that on all levels Good food and fun bar. Rooms relaxing and clean. Staff makes the stay perfect. Stacey the gm went above and beyond made recommendations for restaurants and even reservations! This is a gem of a place.,1
"I am a frequent business traveler and stay in many types of hotels each year. I had the pleasure of staying at the 250 Main Hotel a number of times since it opened in April. Staying at 250 Main is an experience, not just another night in a hotel. The staff is always welcoming, knowledgeable, and engaged in making your... More",1
The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in. The wifi didn't work the front desk gave us a 1800 number to call so we could ask them to reset it. I would not stay here again.,0
"We had a minor issue with our toilet, the staff was very attentive to our issue and worked to resolve our problem timely. We appreciated their responsiveness.",1

"We had a wonderful stay at the Aria. Breakfast buffet had everything you could want. Had a need for maintenance, they were quick and professional. Pool time was fantastic. Check-in was a bit rough, apparently if you use express check-in, you can bill purchases to your room. Overall, great trip!!",1
I was beside the steps and people was up and down those stairs all night and early in the morning. I really didn't get my proper rest that I needed. And they were so loud.,1
Bad: The bar tender in the Casino was not at all friendly or attentive. Good: very nice restored hotel. Excellent condition. Great atmosphere. A very nice place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas,1
"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager",1
"Hotel was great, easy to find and close to Louisville Slugger. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was the parking. The parking garage is on the other side of another hotel.",1
This is by far the best Choice affiliated hotel in which we have stayed. Everything is clean and orderly and the staff was just great. The breakfast menu is better than most. I would recommend this location to anyone. Ulmerton Rd. is a high traffic volume major artery so a little map study preparation will help at arrival. The parking... More,1

"We had to stay here for a long period of time. When we first arrived we got there 4 hours before normal check in and they allowed us to get a room!

My wife and I flew in for the big game (UNC vs DUKE) to find that we arrived to early for check in.

Not only was he working the front desk all by himself but we watched this man service every... More,1
Standard Candlewood hotel. Nice and clean. Room was nice and comfortable.,1
"Bad: The room was very small and dark. Bathroom was large. The window faced an alleyway. Good: Amazing location and great price, clean room and nice staff.",1
"The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport.",1
"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi",1

"It's a cheap and easy alternative when the Hilton and Marriot are booked. Very clean, staff was pleasant and rooms setup with desk, wifi, mini-fridge and microwave. It has all the overnight essentials. Pet friendly. And did I mention inexpensive",1
"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!",1
It was great. I was just a little disappointed that the local channels would not come through on the tv. I was told a maintenance technician would be up to assist and no one ever showed.,1
"Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!",0
"Up to date hotel, consider carrying Starbucks coffee in the rooms, access to the business center was a plus and you had working printers too great amenity. I would stay here again",1
Good: Excellent location,1
I will be returning the service was excellent,1
"My stay here was very nice, the staff were nice, the hotel was in great condition and had great views to downtown. Very reasonable pricing also. My only complaint is that we did not know ahead of time that all rooms do not have a refrigerator. I was informed that only the executive king suites have refrigerators. Lucky enough for us we brought along an icebox and was able to keep everything cold. All in all I would recommend this hotel!",1
it was great,1

"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location.",1

"Dark rooms because only sliding glass door for sunlight and plantation shutters needed to be propped open (I ised water bottles). No other Windows! Check in people not very friendly. Pool noisy til 10 so had to close sliding door at night. Cracks in stairs and rusty door opening. Pluses: good oatmeal, fruit and coffee in am. Pool is nice . View is nice. Liked kitchenette",1
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt House Hotel in Seattle, it was a great place to stay. Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around.",1
"Nice room, looked to be in the last stages of a renovation. I would stay there again. Charged for a safe but was unable to locate it. There room had hardwood floors which is something new to me in a hotel experience.",1
"My stay was short...wished I could have stayed longer. Check in was fast. Staff very professional. Hotel was clean and inviting. Suite was spacious for a high rise Hotel. Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area.",1
"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.",0
Bad: When two people sleep in the bed you settle to the middle of bed and makes for a uncomfortable night's rest. Good: The hotel location and the room layout and scenery was very nice.,1
"This is an older property with very limited parking. Since the town of Solvang is easily accessible by walking, most lodging is convenient. The rooms were clean and decor is basic.

Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds,1
"Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion.",0
"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob",0

Ate breakfast onsite two mornings -- the menu is diverse and creative with good prices.Thank you Joel! We're happy to hear you had a great stay. We hope to welcome you again in the future.",1
Wonderful place to stay. Just a short walk to everything. Very clean but remember to take the do not disturb sign off your door before 11:00 am or there is no room service. We took it off at 11:15 am and the cleaning cart was at our door when we left the room. We returned at 4:30 pm and the... More,1
"This is a condominium hotel that was built for sale purposes. As such, it is a much larger and superior accomodation ( several rooms) that would be found at other resorts. The hotel, grounds and staff were all excellent. There are a few minor downsides to this property in my opinion. First, it is a little distant from the other... More",1
"I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster.",1
The hotel is average and borders on outdated. The internet is unreliable if you can get it to work at all. Housekeeping is questionable. The staff is friendly and appear to care. Good breakfast options.,1
Great stay!,1
We stayed here on our way to Memphis It suited our needs and we'd stay again. Obviously you'd be in a car to stay here as no restaurants next door but we found plenty 5 mins away. Was a sunny day so we stopped by the pool. Small but suited us as we were the only ones there.,1
"Beautiful hotel! The corner suite is very tech savy and modern! I like the separate living space and bedroom. I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device! The monorail also stops here which is a plus! Overall, it can be pricey, but it's worth it!",1
Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.,1
The hotel location was excellent. The attached restaurants are high end and perfect for celebrating a special occasion. The Saturday afternoon chocolate and champagne tasting was a real treat. The included breakfast had made to order omelettes with all fresh ingredients. Bathroom was spacious and the room was cozy. I would return here on my next trip to Baltimore.,1
This hotel staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable and satisfied with your stay there. We've come here many times and will continue to because they make us feel welcome. We could have stayed nearby at other hotels but we prefer how this hotel is r4un by the management.,1
"My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children.",1
"My first impression was that the lobby was full of pimps and hookers! The hotel was very nice, very clean but the guys standing by the door asking if they could bum a cigarette as I checked in with my 3 small sons skeeved me out a little bit. The room was clean, beds comfortable, towels fluffy, we checked in at 11.30pm and were out by 9am so it was a place to sleep and nothing else.",1
"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly.",1
Bad: No microwave. Good: The shower was amazing,1
"When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door.",0
"Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception.",1
"I stayed here while my mother was in the hospital having surgery. Its very close within walking distance and very convenient. The staff were all very helpful and understanding to my situation. There is a bird aviary with the most finches I have seen in one spot, very peaceful to listen to and watch. Nice addition to the Best Western",1
I was on a weekend trip to attend Gonzaga. Everything about the hotel was great except that they don't offer any shuttle services.Most of the like priced hotels nearby do.,1
"We've stayed here many times over the years. Its going down hill fast. The new management only see .

"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!",1
Bad: Shower Tub clogged. Good: Convenient location. Reasonable food prices. Awesome selection of cuisine. Helpful staff!,1
"Our credit card has had a hold charge in it for a week now. 150 hold for incidentals for a two night stay!! I was told the general manager could clear it, but he never called me back.

I was really happy with my experience at this hotel! I stayed here for a weekend in August. The room was nice and extremely clean. The staff was incredibly friendly. I loved the bathroom and it had a great shower. Right outside the hotel is a stop for the streetcar so its in a great location too. Absolutely no complaints... More,1
The bed was not comfortable. The shower was nice,1
"I was impressed with this property. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. Location was very convenient to many restaurants and attractions. I would recommend this property to anyone wanting to check out downtown Chattanooga. The only downside was the parking garage, it was a little inconvenient when carrying luggage.",1
We stayed for the weekend and made trips back and forth to the beach. It's about a 20 minute drive to the beach but we didn't run into any traffic. The continental breakfast was great! The hotel staff was great! Definitely would stay again!,1
"I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that.",0
"Enjoyed the stay. Your crew is excellent, in spite of the power outage. Your Happy Hour is very happy, excellent service. The catering company is doing a very nice job of making everybody happy. The front end staff is doing a very good job, the wake-up computer needs to be checked out. The 11:15 PM computer generated wake-up call was... More",1
"did not meet my expectations at all! I've stayed with this chain before and was impressed, but not this time! The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax. A complete ripoff!",1
It was awesome they were friendly and the cleaning was above and beyond. Friendly personel exelent location. Exeptional overall value. I'll be back!!!!,1
"We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes.",1
I went into the dark room and the lights did nothing to brighten it up. Also when I drove up I thought the place was deserted and shut down. I turned around and left...even though I was losing over 100.,0
room layout is very ideal as kids slept on pullout and we had separated king bed. tv swivels both ways!,1
The internet was broke for one night The staff were not helpful and almost rude The toilet also borke Totally not good experience,0
"I LOVE this hotel... I've been traveling to Atlanta for work recently and it is uber convenient for me in a lovely neighborhood. But more than that, I feel super welcome and comfortable here.

"We had a great time. Everyone was friendly. That being said, breakfast was cold and the eggs were fake. Coffee was good thoigh. Also we could not control the temperature of the room. Room was clean and spacious. Location was excellent!",1
"This motel is definitely not a 3* resort so make sure you know that before booking a room at the Baymont Inn and Suites. The place is pretty shabby and rundown. The room I had needed to be updated -as the sheets were dingy, and the bathtub was old and rusty. The breakfast was so nasty that I had to... More",0
"I was looking for a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay for a week long course. The hotel was conveniently located for me. It has excellent beach access. Rooms are small with some inconveniences, but adequate. Parking spaces are way too narrow. You can park entirely within the marked lines and still have trouble getting into and out of your car. Overall it met my needs, and I would certainly consider staying there again.",1
"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More",0

"It was a good place to stay. Staff was friendly. Hotel seems a bit run down but the proximity to attractions and restaurants was convenient. My husband and I cleaned the room, as it was not quite clean as we wanted it to be. There was a microwave and fridge in the room which was not mentioned in the room... More",1
"This is probably the cheapest dim sum restaurant in SGV. When I say cheapest, not just the price but the portion of the dishes. You really get your moneys worth. Like their baked BBQ pork buns, three huge ones on one plate! Everything is decent in size. Get there early, like around 11AM or later after the lunch rush. Don't... More",1
"If you love trains you will be able to hear them all night long as they blare their horn and roar past the motel! If you're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home. On a positive note, the room was clean and the towels were soft. NOT worth 60!",0
"We were smelling cigarette smoke in our room and proceeded to open both windows and the door. It really didn't help so we went into the hall and determined it must be coming from the room across from us and into the vents. We called the desk, they sent a man up, and he said he could not knock on... More",0
Location of the Quality Inn facilitates easy access to other parts of the island while still within easy walking distance of downtown Bar Harbor. Reasonable rates in a dated but clean facility. Free breakfast is good but in a separate building.,1
Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More,0
"As a regular Best Western guest, there comes a time to also comment on just plain helpful and good people, not just the room.

This hotel is located close to I20 and has a staff that goes out of their way to please the guests. This was especially true of Mr. Terry who handled the breakfast area and was truly concerned about your enjoyment and satisfaction. The only negative is that hallway carpeting is stretched and somewhat lumpy. Some paint touch up in the... More,1

"Me parecio un excelente hotel, a pesar de estar lejos de Washington es muy facil llegar alli, el shuttle te lleva a la estacion del tren y en 20 minutos estas en el centro de Washington, el personal es muy amable y aunque no todos hablan ingles hacen lo posible por entender y hacerse entender. El senor del shuttle habla espanol y es muy amable. El desayuno es agradable y variado. En general es un hotel recomendado para pasar unos dias, descansar y visitar la ciudad.",1
Not particularly clean. Bathrooms very small with small toilets. Front desk clerk very polite. no elevators. Breakfast was decent. No elevators. Repairs needed.,0
"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!",1
"Very helpful knowledgable staff. Great location, poor wifi.",1
Very nice facility. Very good breakfast. Room comfortable. Several non-smoking rooms had stale tobacco smell. The location was a bit distance from Farmington and facilities such as the Pinon Hills Golf course.,1

"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car.",1

"My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.",1

"Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip.",1
"This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.",0
Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.,0

Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!",1
"A good value for travelers. You don't get the premium amenities but the hotel is clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast is rather standard but solid, you shouldn't go hungry. Well located right off the interstate it is convenient. You can't beat it if you're travelling.",1
Room had wall paper and curtain falling down Plus blanket was dirty. Can deal with that but we had no heat and maintenence staff would not be back until the morning. Room was freezing cold. I have pictures if Expedia wants to see them. Remove this hotel from your listing please.,0
Stayed here while we were in in town seeing a show at the Fox. Short drive to the Fox and to the Galleria. Super close to Forest Park. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. Would definitely stay again!,1
Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you.,1
Bad: No breakfast hall Poor breakfast Unacceptable even hotels 1 star has a hallor space for breakfast. Good: Central hotel Good rooms Very Clean Curtese staff,1
Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving,1
"Nice location, nice front desk service.",1
"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it.",1
We have been coming here for years so her daughter can visit the allergy clinic next-door. About four years ago I rated this hotel a five-star with perfect cleanliness. Over the years areas around the pool and other common areas such as the elevator carpet are beginning to show wear. I found myself wiping splash marks of an unknown beverage... More,1
Had a great time on a family trip. Will definitely stay at this hotel again. Convenient to DC and other Virginia towns.,1
Very friendly staff. Room provided ultimate comfort for relaxation.,1
"Stayed here for about four days while in town visiting family. We had a two year old with us, and the check in staff offered him a snack from the gift shop upon check in. They were so accommodating when we requested early check in as well. Our two bedroom suite was very clean and comfortable, and had plenty of... More",1
Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!,1
"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"We got a room here after arriving in The Dells without a reservation. It was VERY VERY clean and reasonably priced, but the furnishings were outdated. That certainly doesn't matter as you are not in the Dells to be in your room. It was just my husband and I and we didn't have time for the pool amenities, so I... More",1
"Checked in 10 pm just to sleep for the night and get up in the am, and head back to Hollywood for the day. This hotel is a hot tub time machine...the rooms are extremely dated, stained..the walls are peach and tan colo, gold and cream colored dresser, popcorn ceilings, green tile in the bathroom with tons of stains and...

"Empire Towers is a no-frills hotel with pretty decent continental breakfast, standard rooms, and tremendous staff. Pros: the staff was awesome! Can't say anything else! They were helpful and attentive to our needs! Breakfast everyday was great! Can't complain there. Cons: the darn lock on our room kept locking us out and for me no exercise room though it did...

"Stayed at the Oxford a couple times now and it has always delivered. Welcoming staff that always greets you with a smile and asks how they can help. This past weekend our suite was amazing and had the perks of a large balcony and steam room shower with two shower heads, which was perfect after a long day of skiing.... More",1
"My stay here was what I expected. The staff is friendly enough, and the hotel is pretty clean. The parking can be tricky because when I arrived after 6p, it seemed to be pretty full. If you do not have Diamond level status, then you may have to park far away from an entrance/exit. A plus, though, is that there... More",1
"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager",1
Took almost twenty minutes to check in says it's a ramada has different brand everywhere carpet in hallway looks like a murder scene. Not happy at all. By the way I will take pic of bathtub check it out. 99.00 rooms. Tried to use the phone from the early 20's but no dial tone.,0
The place is dirty. My daughter and son in law stayed there about a month ago. The place was worn down and in need of a good cleaning. The TVs were old and worn out as well. Most people never stay here twice.,0
"Bad: Nada. Good: Amenities, staff, decor, room",1
Great hotel! I enjoyed the city views from this high rise building.,1
"Older hotel that is in the middle of a commercial business park, stayed for a few days, room was clean and well furnished, walls are a little thin, but that's what you get with an older place. good coffee shop in the lobby, walking distance to Karl Strauss Brew Pub, would stay again.",1
"If you are looking for a nearby hotel your headquarter offices, specially Mercedes Benz, this would be a perfect choice. It has all the needed services, nice restaurant and they offer you a shuttle service to and from office without charge.",1
Comfortable living with kitchen and all other facilities. Ideal for business stay. social hours are great fun with your friends. abundant parking space coupled with good lawns in case you see the sun.,1
My wife and I stayed at the Comfort Suites over Memorial Day weekend and used it as a jumping point for the 4 days we were there. The hotel is easily accessible from 470 which was great because we spent most of our time driving to other areas in the Denver metro or into the mountains. It was not a... More,1
Great hotel. We will be spending New Years Eve there.,1
"This hotel is wonderful. It is away from the hustle and bustle, but is situated nicely. The mall and other restaurants are very close. We even took a 2 hour excursion to St. George Island. We had a ball! Can't wait to go back.",1
Worst motel I've ever went to. Spiders and other bugs in bed. My room smelled like throw up. Their was a knife under the bed but thank god it was just a toy. Beds have stains. Bugs in the shower. Right when I got to get in the shower right when I turned the water on.....brown water came out. You... More,0
"Stopped last minute when traveling thru the area. Room was nice, staff was nice. Breakfast was great, area organized well to accommodate a lot of people. 'Dee' was very nice and was busy working to keep everything filled up, clean..asked if she could help or pick up trash. Nice experience.",1
"Bad: Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels, cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back. Brushing teeth, shaving etc. Decor was showing its age. Good: Location near the commons was good. There's a small playground nearby which is good for those with youmg kids.",1
Poker room really great management very friendly and helpful. Many choices of food so it is not boring. Plenty of activities gaming plenty of choices We played in a slot Tournament won some money The resort always have nice offers to play and stay we had a really good time,1
Location is unsafe and hotel looks pretty old. I used to stay at Best Western but I do not recommend anyone to stay here.,0
"The Modern is a great place to stay in Boise, especially for someone who values the small and personal. It's walking distance to downtown and a mere stroll to a great brewery and a few taprooms. The fantastic Big City Coffee is practically next door and it has it's own bar that offers some amazing drinks. A lovely place to... More",1

Good: The continental breakfast didn't disappoint. Staff were friendly and the location was perfect!,1
My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very nice. They have a kitchen that helps to save on eating out. They have a bedroom separate from the main living area. We would absolutely recommend this hotel and we will be back. Thank you for helping make this a very enjoyable... More,1
"Rooms were fine, breakfast was fair and reservation were a disaster. Poorly trained reservationist, said room would cost one thing and said he'd call me back after specking with management for rate. He didn't. I called back the next day he quoted me higher rate...said rate had been approved. After fighting for it, an adjustment was made.",0
"This hotel was fully adequate for our family. It was nothing fancy but it was absolutely fine for what it was. It's set in the middle of a million other hotels with a Target and Starbucks nearby. Good proximity to various attractions including Disneyland, and Chapman University. Quiet, convenient.",1
"The staff went over and above to make sure our Volleyball team was well taken care of. Its a perfect location Downtown and walking distance to everything....Restaurants, Gonzaga, Convention Center and Park",1
"I agree with other reviewers that the staff was very helpful and friendly. Krystal was particularly attentive during the evening reception when it came to food, beverages and finding the playoff baseball game on TV. I also liked the breakfast selection, especially the pre-made biscuit sandwiches. The hotel appears to be a remodeled apartment complex. I had the 2-bedroom loft... More",1
"Good location for National Airport, but very pricey. Hotel very nicely maintained. A bit of road noise.The 'Manager's Reception' features plenty of drinks, and some food, but not really dinner. Good exercise room. Breakfasts are excellent, but start at 6 so not good for very early flights. Watch out for all the kids. The place was overrun with them when I was there.",1
"We had a 15 night stay and this was perfect. There was great restaurants nearby and the kitchenette is great to make things in your room and save on meals. The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review. I am so glad to hear that we were able to accommodate you and your family.Hope to see you again on your next trip to Anaheim.Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager",1

"Dirty hotel room floor, the room was inside the building with the windows overlooking the hall and the rooms across the hall (how is this not a fire hazard!!!). The breakfast was cold, self-served a la carte in a dirty hall. Parking structure overcrowded. Awesome location.",0
"Clean rooms, wonderfully comfortable bed. It is nice to have a microwave and a frig in the room. Nice pool. Fitness room pretty basic, but at least had a stationary bike and treadmills.

Good breakfast. Very convenient to Dollywood.,1
Everyone was very nice and helpful.,1
We stayed at the hotel for the Army-Navy weekend. It was a WONDERFUL stay. The rooms were great- large- kitchen area with huge living room and a very comfortable bed. It was just one block from the Inner Harbor. The staff was outstanding!!! They were very helpful in answering any questions and gave very helpful suggestions for restaurants. We would definitely stay there any time we go back to Baltimore and the Inner Harbor.,1
A nice hotel. Overall nice people. No free breakfast as a Hilton Honors Diamond Member. Received a whopping 750 points total for not receiving 4 days of free breakfast. Nice gym. Nice pool. Clean room.,1
"Stayed here since I was travelling alone and looking for decent rate. I paid about half the cost of the other newer motel options available at this I-40 exit. The pluses: Nice friendly staff, decent breakfast, reasonable cost, quiet. The negatives: Older property and furniture, poor room lighting, mediocre bedding and towels. I would stay here again if travelling alone.... More",1
Bad: Floor to ceiling see through glass in bathroom. Good: Large floor to ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Chic design.,1
Bad: Needs remodeleing Could hear planes taking offf. We've stayed at airport hotels before that are soundproofed so well you can't hear the planes. Good: Close to airport,1
"The hotel would not. The hair dryer was broken. The cable was out in the area. However, when we caller for service they came to repair the toilet and the hairdryer right away.",1
"The beds were worn out and rolled to the middle, every time you moved the bed made noise. The tub was old and discolored. The towels were ruff and smaller. Breakfast was a surprise and decent. It had hot waffles, but there was not fruit available. The street getting to this hotel had huge pot holes that could not be... More",0
"Hotel was clean. Our room was a standard with king bed. Room was spacious with plenty of amenities.

They had magazines in room which I loved I sat on the comfy in room chair with ottoman,... More",1
We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience in this recently opened dining room. The steak can only be described as succulent. The wait staff was professional and attentive. The atmosphere was warm combining contemporary furnishings with what I assume to be 19th century architecture. We really enjoyed the jazz band which performed in a smallish room adjacent to the bar.,1
"I love The Grand Del Mar in Del Mar California. This might have been my 6th time there. It is the only hotel in the area that i will stay at. It is truly a 5 star property. The staff is professional and very attentive. The rooms are very spacious, with marble bathrooms and separate shower and soaking tub. The... More",1
"This was my second time staying at this hotel, and each time the hotel staff has been accommodating, the rooms are large, and the decor is fresh, updated. This is my go to hotel when I need a place to stay that's close to BWI airport.",1
Good: The AC hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were a group of friends coming from different states to meet up. It was conveniently located close to public transportation and made it easy for all of us to get there. The hotel was in a great location! It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier.,1
This is our second time here. We love it! The cabins are so nice. The staff is excellent. Putt-putt course is recently renovated. Quiet area surrounded by ponderosa pines. There are a few pet friendly cabins. Call ahead to check availability. Those cabins look the same as the others. Those cabins do have a cage on the side near the... More,1

"This hotel impresses from start to finish. From the moment you arrive, the courteous staff greets you and assists you in every way possible. The rooms are adorable with a nautical theme.

"The staff was helpful in locating where we were attending a meeting. The hotel was wonderful from the coffee and rookies to the facility. the indoor pool was great. The room was great and clean. It was large, two closets and a very comfortable bed. The room was quiet and the hotel very nice. The only problem was the parking... More",1
"The room is small and when we added a cot, it was almost too small. The important things, like air conditioner, tv package, internet, etc...were all sufficient. (the tv package was better then average compared to other chains). The room had a large shower which is normal for a Sleep Inn. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The breakfast had... More",1
"The suite was very spacious and the amenities were good. The living room has comfortable chairs, a roomy couch/convertible bed, and an adequate dining area. The bedroom made sleeping easy and pleasurable. Although the hotel's fitness room is sparse the pool and spa are delightful with its glass ceiling and walls providing great views of the surrounding foliage. I also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast with eggs made to order. I will definitely return to this hotel.",1
Staff is always friendly and pleasant and responsive to my needs. The office printer and computer worked great and the breakfast excellent as is the service. The kitchen help is always making me laugh and does a great job.,1
"The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead.",1
"The title says it all. Felt it was well priced for a good location (walking distance to bourbon and Frenchmen), very spacious rooms which helps when traveling in groups. Good onsite breakfast options.Thanks so much for taking the time to share your feedback, we are thrilled to learn of your great experience. We hope we will be your go-to hotel in NOLA. See you next time, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal,1
"My mom and I were in town for a girls weekend. We checked in before having dinner downtown and thought the room was decent. It looked like it had fairly had been remodeled with fairly new paint and furnishings in the last couple of years. Although the hallways and room itself had a lingering cigarette smoke smell, it's to be... More",0
Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton.,0
"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years. The staff is always friendly (like family), the rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable. Breakfast is one of the best offered at any of the hotel/motels that we have stayed at. I plan to visit again in the near future and will make it... More",1
"The best part of this hotel is the location. It's within walking distance of everything. The breakfast was severely lacking and crowded, but we'd rather go out and eat at the local places anyway. The hotel is right on the river, which is gorgeous. Bring extra bread to feed the ducks! The rooms were very outdated, but we didn't really... More",1
"Finally Made a reservation with Omni after many attempts. Their reservation system would put call on hold for a long time. Should have been a warning on things to come I finally called the front desk and they connected me to reservations. Made a reservation to check in May 28th, three nights. Requested early check in This was a special... More",0
Awesome!,1
"I chose this Microtel because I had stayed here before about eight years ago and it was very nice. At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill. The wall above the closet was damaged, the tub was worn, and the plumbing under the sink was disgustingly filthy. There are a number of lodging options within a block the next time I need to stay in this area I will use one of them.",1
We had special reservation request at the time of booking and our request was granted over the phone - however upon arrival they did not deliver. Bedding had funny smell too :( I would recommend another hotel if traveling through Brownsburg.....,0
"Good: Hotel staff very helpful and friendly, your service was commendable, area we were at had alot of shopping and food places close, very convenient .",1
"The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool.",1
"There were four people staying in the room. Only had 3 sets of towels. Told the front desk, they said housekeeping would bring another set. Never happened. Saw 1 person from housekeeping in the hall way. I asked for towels, she pointed to her cart down the hall and told me to get my own. Very rude. Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax.",1
"Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys.",0
Bad: The toilet in our room blocked couple times. Good: Great location and free parking! Less than 5 mins walk to the strip.,1
Check in service was slow. Personnel were rude. Smoking room was given to two non-smokers. Strong smell in room even with air conditioner running non-stop.,1
"I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job",1
Bad: Pool close too early. Should be stay availble all the time overnight. Good: Room cleanness and staff,1
Everything we ate was fresh and tasty! We had the best stuffed blueberry french toast and make sure you try the pecan chicken. Melts in your mouth!,1
"The room was pleasant. However, I could have done without the cockroaches in the kitchen area and the bathroom. When you only clean rooms once a week you are going to have bugs!!",0
It took at least 30 minutes to get checked in. then my key cards would not work. we went to a concert and showed back up at the hotel around midnight and the whole building smelled like poop. Just checked my bank account and they charged me twice for the room. not pleased at all,0
"Excellent connecting condos for our large group. We did not choose to use the the local amenities, but it was close to the volleyball center which was our purpose of travel. The hotel staff was welcoming and easy to work with when reserving our group rooms.",1
Everyone went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable.,1
"The staff are very friendly and willing to assist you with whatever need you may have. The rooms are modern and reasonably priced, the Internet is fast and free for Hilton Honors members. There is a casino right next door, I don't really gamble so I can't review it.",1
"I was at Galt house for a convention for 3 days. The hotel rooms are nice and the hotel is a great, relaxing location. However, the personal touch for guests is missing. I have two examples. The first is a MAJOR health concern that a lot of people deal with today and that is a Latex Allergy. Every restaurant in... More",1
"We went there in March with our grandson primarily to visit the aquarium which is right across the street from the hotel. In fact, the tiny balcony on our room directly faced it, much to the pleasure of our 8 year old. The front desk girl when we visited was extremely friendly. She in fact kept an eye on our... More",1
This place is amazing. Beautiful rooms. Clean and spacious. Front desk was very friendly. Will def try to come back in August for my birthday! Beautiful lobby and an outdoor seating area with a fire pit and a grill. Minutes from PNC field. Heading there later to watch a game. The pool area and fitness room and hot tub area... More,1
"Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was fine. The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful. I did find the hotel a bit too far from the downtown, although it is on the free shuttle line. When we rented a car we could park it for free at the hotel, which I am told is not always so. There is nothing happening right around the hotel, but it is near a marina.",1
"I understand these cabins are 75 years old so I didn't expect to walk into a 5 star facility but I did expect it to be clean, even somewhat clean would have been nice. The shower had not been cleaned AT ALL, the commode was not flushed, one bed had hair in it, the other bed had dirt in it,... More",0
"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby.",1
"Front desk staff was awesome. David was amazing, he was exceptional in providing quality customer service. Whenever we had a need, he was quick to assist and resolve. Housekeeping was excellent and maintenance too as they had to repair a socket. 5 stars!",1
Call to get their websiter Get new rooms and low rates toor 10 off for veterans and students,1
I have to recommend your housekeeping staff. The roof was fit for a king. I am employed in the housekeeping field so my standards in cleanliness and neatness go way beyond and my room was neat clean and very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast the hotel offered in the morning. The staff coming in the front door was very welcoming and pleasant. If I could I would stay at this hotel 3-4 days a month. I really didnt want to leave. Thank you for a great stay.,1
I stayed here with some friends for a convention. It was a good room and the free breakfast was nice.,1
"Stayed for 2 night with 2 dogs, really clean hotel for being pet friendly the staff was really friendly. Also GREAT Steakhouse next door - very convenient. No complaints at all.",1
"Was nice location from the long drive from Nutley, NJ to Washington DC. The shower and bathroom facilities is very good. The room is spacious and well lit. The front lights and bathrooms lights were remarkable since it has motion detectors and switches on and off automatically. Overall the stay was welcoming for well traveled guests.",1
"We have gone scalloping with Capt Russ for the past four summers. It is truly one of our favorite activities. We always get our scallop limit. Russ is so helpful, knowledgeable and relaxed that we all can't wait to see him. We have sent many groups his way and everyone feels the same. Scalloping with native sun tours is a... More",1
"The room was comfortable, quiet and clean. The desk staff was super helpful. They even lent me a wall charger for my phone for the night (and offered to let me keep it when I went to return it the next morning). I was given directions to a great neighborhood to run through. Wonderful stay!",1
Overall a good stay as it was my 3rd or 4th for the month of March. Clean rooms and nice staff. I can not rate the breakfast as I normally sleep in until after.,1
Bad: Wasn't on the strip. Good: Showers and location,1
"I was extremely happy with the location of the hotel, it is located in the heart of historic Charleston with everything within walking distance. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and the decor was charming.",1
"The hotel was old but fairly well maintained. I would not call it a 4 star hotel. Our problem had to do with the shuttle pick up after a day of being at Summerfest. We were told that the shuttle would be at the designated pickup area every half hour, so we were there a little before midnight. I decided... More",0
"Get the 'King Leisure room. Spacious enough for couples to have their own space many have two TV's, fridges and microwaves. Some are even suites. Undergoing renovations and we had a new room and it was excellent. Staff is outstanding. The only shortcoming worth mentioning is breakfast but, at 6:30 AM who cares - coffee is great and who can...

"This hotel is extremely reasonable, well located and very recently remodeled. You certainly wouldn't expect the updated look in a place this modest. It is well worth the money to stay here. My husband and I stayed just one night but would not hesitate to stay here again when we need a place in this location. Save money by staying... More",1
"WiFi turns off each 15 min requiring new log in. 2 broadcast channels didn't work, some cable channels scratchy, but HBO and NBC were loud and clear along with all the ESPN and FOX channels. Bed was nice, could have used some firmer pillows. Super friendly and polite staff that stands out. FREE car parking for guests! Local area, well it's a NYC area airport hotel. Still I'd rather use EWR over the others for accessibility. Enough said.",1
"The hotel lobby is quaint, but the room was well appointed. The room slept well and the internet connections was great. The property is in a great locations, closely located near the slopes and the amphitheater. There was a welcome reception that was very nice, with complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres. This was a lovely trip, I hope to visit... More",1
Great downtown location with easy access to local businesses and downtown historical points. Friendly staff with no frills comfortable accommodations at a fair price. Within walking distance to downtown tourist attractions. Easy to get to.,1
"Clean, big, motel room... Old but very clean, extra comfortable bed. Free fast wi-fi. Breakfast- basic: muffin, bagel, jam, butter, cooked egg and yogurts. Negative: reception staffs are not friendly and the price is relatively high for a motel in Pullman.",1
"The hotel has some wear but the rooms are very clean and the staff is excellent. I would not hesitate to stay there again, though the hotel does need some updating to stay competitive.",1
"The Hotel Maya is a fun experience! Not only was the staff very friendly, but the accommodations were excellent, the service was on point and the room was fresh, clean and quiet. And the best part You get a cookie! I highly recommend this place!",1
"Bad: Wifi strength not great for end room. Good: Staff, location, rooms",1
I have stayed at this hotel several times. The location is great and the staff is friendly. The hot water was only warm which made the stay less than stellar.,1
"Room smelled musty, carpets and bedding had a sticky feel. Pool out of order. Keep driving and don't stop here.",0
I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!,1
"This hotel is outside of DC, but its shuttle goes directly to the metro, which goes directly to sites in DC. Everyone on the staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was served starting at 6:30am, which allowed us to depart early each day. We would stay here again.",1
"Bad: Breakfast, cheap buffet. Good: Conveninent and calm place fir Las Vegas",1
Bad: access to parking. Good: the location,1
IT WAS OUR MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARY 52ND WHEN THE MANGER HEARD THAT THEY GAVE US A FREE ROOM UPGRADE.,1
"The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!",1
"Very friendly service. One of the best values in lodging today. Excellent rooms. Hope to stay here again. If you like a small town atmosphere and down home service, look no further. The large undercover seating area is great for visiting or just relaxing.",1
"Room was nice and tidy, absolutely loved the sheets. They were incredibly comfortable and I didn't want to get out of bed. Wish there was more variety in the vending machine area though. I only had coke or sprite to choose from on my floor.",1
"Overall, the value was good for our purpose which was just a place to sleep. The front desk staff were top notch, going above and beyond to make sure that our room was satisfactory. The kitchenette was useful. The curious stains on the carpet and duvet would make me think twice about staying here again however.",1
"We recently traveled to Northern Vermont for the first time. On the recommendation of a friend, we stayed at the Grey Gables Mansion. Tim and Debbie were fantastic hosts. The room was comfortable and clean, the breakfasts were the best, and it nice to be welcomed guests. Tim and Debbie gave us ideas for local dining, ways t best see... More",1
"I booked this hotel for a last minute New Years stay-cation and it lived up to my expectations, for it to be New Years the staff was really helpful and friendly, and the hotel was filled to capacity but it still didn't seen crowded at all. And the breakfast buffet in the morning definitely came to a rescue from an evening of New Years partying",1
"Bad: There were a lot of little costs we weren't expecting - parking being a big one. Good: Location, size of room, indoor pool",1
We have stayed at this Comfort Inn many times and have always been happy with the service and amenities. We enjoy the pool and the included breakfast.,1
"I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member and tend to use this brand often. I found this location to be just ok. The hotel was nothing special and the staff were not very friendly. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel is safe and quiet. Having an early morning flight, I was disappointed that I was unable to get... More",1
"The room was not bad, but the couch was so worn we practically sat on the floor. It was also pretty stained. The bedspread was also very worn and starting to get holes in it. The beds were kinda hard. It did have 2 full bathrooms and a full kitchen including dish washer!!! I felt safe and the room was easy to find. Map quest did put us at the back of the hotel though, and it was kind of confusing to get up to the front office. Overall it wasn't bad. It was clean. It just needs a few furniture updates.",1
"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",0
Older motel.Iffie room but you get value for your money. Safe neighborhood.Close to metro rail transport. Great staff (Salima from Marocco) The free breakfeast was worldclass.Totally upperclass !. If you want value for money in DC this is a great choice.,1
"How great is it, having 5 little girls to find a hotel that's affordable, clean, and FITS US ALL LEGALLY!!! Best western rocks. We love it, and we're probably gonna be using them exclusively. We are a traveling family band, and we find these 2 queen suites to be just wonderful. Breakfast was better than average, and the pool rocked.... More",1
The staff of this hotel is filled with kindness and professionalism. It is always a pleasure to be here. The location is perfect for walking to a vibrant restaurant scene. This is always my first choice when I visit the upstate and look forward to my return next week,1
"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.",1
"This hotel is in a great location, right in the heart of everything. Parking is 35/day but right next door. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The check in/check out procedure was very fast. Complimentary breakfast was just okay. Rooms are nice. Didn't have a good experience with housekeeping in my bathroom.",1
"Bad: Rooms with connecting doors can be very noise due to poor noise control of these doors. Good: Great location, very friendly staff, great vibe",1
"This is our second time in Maui. Honua Kai is a relatively new hotel/resort. Our reservation is thru AAA travel agency, We had a one bedroom suite ocean view.

Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet.,1
"Beautiful mansion, always wanted to stay there. Could you use some improvements on the building. Definitely need new mattresses - ours was lumpy and worn out feeling. Beautiful antiques, wonderful staff - very friendly and helpful. Ideal location in the quarter.",1
WONDERFUL!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER PLACE IN VAIL- STOP LOOKING AND BOOK THIS. Location is great!! Rooms are wonderful and clean and bedding is oh so great Top notch service,1
"Excellent. Gracious clear staff, perfectly cleaned and maintained. It is noteworthy that there is a fee for internet, but the fee was waved for me. Spa and exercise options are very good. The free shuttle from the airport is great.",1
Stayed for the weekend and the only thing I would change is that a free continental breakfast would be nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Harrisburg.,1
I booked a stay at Savanna Inn Suites for a one nigh stay online with Trip Advisor that directed me to Expedia.com at which time I booked a room and got a printed conformation. I arrived at the Inn and show them my conformation letter at which time they said that they had no reservation for me. They check... More,1
"Very pleasant experience, I have no complaints whatsoever. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and quiet. Reasonably priced as well. The breakfast wasn't the World's best but it did the job! I would recommend if you are needing to stay in the Austin area.",1
"A room with a queen-size bed is only 36 including tax. The motel is old, but they do keep it up and the room was clean. Had good WiFi in the room and a ref Microwave. Large well-lit parking area and it is quiet. I will stay here again.",1
"So much to like -- beautiful view, close to everything, bowling pizza for kids right there and I especially love that my dog is welcome! It's not much more expensive than the cheap motels around South Lake Tahoe -- shop for the discounts.",1
"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!",1
"The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our only complaints were that the tv had terrible reception and had lines through the screen. Also there was definitely people smoking pot on our floor as we could smell it everyday. The only other things were obviously unavoidable, like the construction right next door that was very loud, and the power going out one morning.",1
"I really like this hotel as a first experience in South Lake Tahoe it was pretty good choice, the staff was very friendly and multitasking, the room was clean my family felt good coming to here so I'm happy and sure to make a reservation again in the future, may be with more anticipated time and less cost :) Is...

This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is clean and very pleasant. We definitely will return.,1
"This motel is dated and extremely dirty. Everything about this place makes me want to RUN away as far as possible. The carpeted floors were very dirty and were NOT vacuumed. You could see fingernail clippings and food particles, just to name a few. There was a dirty towel and someone's sock right behind the dresser--this will let you know... More",0

A group of people from our Church get together for lunch/brunch once a month after morning worship. We love to come to Spoonbread but our December get-together is always a highlight. They set up tables for us near the Christmas tree in the lobby. The wide variety of food choices including the omelet bar are enjoyed by all. The staff... More,1
"We enjoyed our stay except there were a couple of family reunions going on and the hotel was very full. We were on the third floor and could hear people taking outside all night. Called the desk 2 days in a row and they said they would take care of it, but did not. 2 bad nights of sleep.",1
"Good: The shower was amazing, I cannot speak highly enough about the shower. I travel regularly and this was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at.",1
Bad: The bed wasn't comfortable at all. Good: The room was very very clean.,1
"We were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn. When we arrived, we thought it must be very new, rather than 8 years old, because everything was so clean and fresh. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. The service was excellent- the front desk clerk called just after check in to ensure that our room met expectations and the one... More",1
"Bad: View. We had a view of an alley. But, that's the only downside. Good: Staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were well-appointed, clean and functional.",1
"Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up.",0
THis is second time I've stayed here. Good bang for the buck.,1
"Older dated cheap motel: that was clean, with one of the two best beds in a 2 week trip ! For this class of motel, it is well worth a 5 star rating... better than a lot of motels that cost twice a much or more. Few defects in the tile work in the (dated) bathroom. Will return here any... More",1
"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!",1
"My girlfriends and I planned a fun, overnight trip to Red River. It was a last minute idea, and Lifts West was able to accommodate us with a very nice, clean, and spacious condo. It was perfect the four of us, and plenty of room for relaxing, entertaining, and sleeping. our condo was equipped with full kitchen, two full baths,... More",1
The hotel was great. Getting to the hotel was not so great. The construction on 31 had the gps all screwed up. Not the hotels problem but others should be aware.,1
"If you're simply looking for a place to stay for a night or two, this place fits the bill. It would probably serve the purpose for a lengthier stay if you're fishing with a bunch of buddies. It's not fancy, by any means, but it's perfectly acceptable. Reservation process was handled online and by email with no problems. Check-in was... More",1
"We stayed here one night along with 10 of our travelling companions. Most of our group complained that they could hear partying in rooms next to them. Reporting the noise to the desk did not solve the problem. There was a group of school kids in the hotel, the night we stayed there. The rooms are nice and well equipped... More",1
"We stayed here for a night and absolutely loved it. The hotel staff were courteous, helpful, and very personable. The only thing we could suggest is that they could have something other than water for their guests to drink. Other than that (and that wasn't really a big deal at all), everything was splendid.",1
Bad: The air conditioner was horrible. The sound of the unit running made it impossible to hear TV. We woke up each time during the night. I commented about it to the desk in the morning. At what point is it advisable to get a refund as we were not 100 satisfied Please respond. The staff was pleasant. Good: no croissons,1
"I admit to being apprehensive, as renting sight unseen can be a challenge. We stayed in the OK Corral over New Years. The cabin was exquisite. It is a newer cabin, with everything one could need and more. Kitchen necessities for the 9 of us, but definitely could have accommodated more. Acceptable to nice quality linens on the beds and... More",1
"Had a blast at Arizona Mountain Inn. Cabins are really neat, fully equipped, and the staff goes above and beyond expectations to make you feel comfortable. If you're looking for that log-cabin experience, this is the place for you. Winter skiing, hiking, fishing, hunting, golfing.... all nearby. Super vacation!",1
"I normally stay at hotels with 3 star and below ratings and every once in a while I stay at hotels with excellent ratings when I want to be in a downtown area. To be honest, I didn't like the room. Coffee maker, drawers, and the closet was dirty. Front desk staff is average. Location is great for food and entertainment.",1
Bad: No my experience was horrible it was a bad experience frome the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I had 6 rooms reserved 2 were canceled by hotel then when we asked questions the manager decides to to rais his voice at us to the point everyone on line to check in and around tje aria was able to here what was going on.

Then vale was horrible my sisters car was broken into while on possession of vale instead of helping they yelled at her and dint help her. Ontop of that all my guest and I were separated and it was hard to meet up in my room they elevaters only alow access to your floor not others. Good: .

"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.",0
Everything was great during our stay except that there was no hot water in the sink.,1
"This hotel more than met our expectations, very close to the metro station, 5-10 mins walk, but a free shuttle bus operates anyway so you don't have to walk. Very close to Washington and Arlington Cemetery. The neighbourhood felt safe and we had no fear of walking out even late at night, highly recommended.",1
"Charged me for the night that didn't stay. I booked through Booking.com and kept telling me to contact Booking.com and they didn't take any responsibility. There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through. Unfortunately, nobody showed up for arrival on 12/06, and the reservations were charged first night room and tax for a no show.",0
There was constant noise through out the night from noisey doors to guests talking loud. Sort of feels tile an apartment community. Certainly not my type of place for a good night rest.,0
"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming.",0
"Was promised early check-in...didn't get it. One room was partially cleaned. Restaurant was extremely slow, the food was mediocre and pricey. Internet was really slow. Self parking for only 24 per day. Four or five star priced hotel for a two star (at the most) venue.",0
"I would recommend the property and would happily stay there again,. I think the room was fairly clean, even though because of the decor and color scheme, at first impression, it gave the appearance that it wasn't. The bedding was fine, though there was a hole in the bedspread. The towels were clean, but there was stains that appeared to... More",1
"I was going to be in downtown Atlanta for a convention and had to check in early.

"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",0

"3 stars is a bit over what I would call this hotel. The rooms are old and the walls are thin. Hopefully you can find a silent corner of the hotel because if you neighbors or anyone outside is talking in a regular voice, it sounds like they're in the room. Parking and location is convenient. Nice waterway next door to walk around. With the availability in the area, I would look at other options",0

"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.",0

Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",0
"My fiance and I came here to celebrate our engagement (he proposed on the trip). We absolutely loved the room.

"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.",1
"This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate. All in all, we would stay here again",1
This is is fine old motor inn - old school with the parking lot in the middle. The rooms were big and clean and still had many of the old features - old tiles etc. The staff was friendly and helpful - it was inexpensive and a good place to stop for the night before going into San Francisco.,1

"Bad: Vacant block and vagrancy around hotel. Good: Proximity to the strip, yet quiet and friendly",1
"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal.",1

"I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com.",0

Brought my sister and brother in law from south Africa here and its location and comfort just wowed them. The longer you stay the more convenient that kitchen becomes.,1
I thought the hotel was beautiful from Miami like bar to the indoor pool and Jacuzzi to the Cooked-to -Order buffet breakfast. The prices weren't bad except for the 50 incidental hold they add to ur credit card. And the room should come with free wi fi. I mean they need to get with it. Even motel 6 offers that for free. But outside of that. Great service.,1
Nice hotel near airport. Reasonable price for area. Good breakfast. My first choice the next time I have to overnight for a flight.,1

"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner.

"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse",0

"I was on a short mini-vacation with my granddaughters and it was an excellent choice. Our primary purpose was to visit the Chesapeake Beach Water Park, so this hotel worked out fine. Breakfast was ok, but customer service was awesome.",1
"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!",1

"The place looked promising from the approach its right on the river, facing the beautiful River North area. The building, built way back when, is charming from the outside. And the lobby, while not grand, is also appealing. Once I got into my room, though ho hum.It isnt terrible, but there just is not one thing about it that makes it the least bit special. I had a small room, which was fine, but it was just very bland. The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things, there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that. There wasnt even an iron or board in the room. The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad. My rate was 200, which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed. But in retrospect, I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat. My only plusses were: its location, the fact that I was able to check in early, and free internet. Those arent strong enough factors, though next time Im in Chicago, Ill stay somewhere else. C-minus.",1
"The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you. I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Pedro is great and a big part of our team and I will be sure he sees your kind words. Thank you for taking the time to recognize him as you have.Please come see us again!",1
"The Hotel Was Everything I Expected. Very Reasonable price, being that is 2 Blocks away from New Orleans French Quarter. This gave me the freedom to not worry about Parking or transportation to or from the party life of NOLA. I will continue to visit each and Everytime I come to Louisiana.",1
"The reason I choose this motel was it was the least expensive motel in the area with a total cost with all taxes and fees of about 70.00 a night. Though not expensive, it is a higher end price especially for a motel and for that you would expect to have a very decent to excellent motel room. That was... More",1
Good: Very comfortable bed and a super location to downtown Los Angeles.,1

Everything in the hotel was nice. The only thing about the king sized non-smoking room was the AC didn't work properly. When you put it on full blast it felt like its 70 degrees not 60 degrees. However overall everything was nice.,1

Our flight was cancelled due to the Southwest computer debacle of July 2016 so we needed to find rooms with very little notice.

This place is new and very very nice. Breakfast was outstanding. If in the area you must stay here. The room and bathroom was nice size. Halls are well lite. Beautifully decorated with modern features. A nice restaurant next to the Hampton.,1
"There is an 18 per day charge for parking (very well secured) which is not disclosed in the expedia information. Other than that, the hotel was pretty nice. Rooms are currently undergoing refurb, our room had the brand new carpet smell which was quite overwhelming. The staff was nice courteous. The breakfast buffet was not up to ES standards compared to others. Hotel was very clean. Oh, and the elevator, you have to take one up from the garage then another up to the rooms and elevator service was slow, small often cramped with people or guests with luggage.",1
"Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018.",1

Phone did not work, no dial tone, no way to contact front desk. Went to continental breakfast, and muffins were covered with ants. She put them away, but next morning, the muffins served were stale. I believe she saved them and served them the next day.",0
"Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose. Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all. Save your self the resort fees, stay here and eat you way around Vegas!!",1

"The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC.",1
"This hotel was easily located off the major highway. When we arrived, our room was not ready, but they gave us another room. No noise was heard from this side of the building.

"Hotel is very nice, but I waited an hour at the metro station for the hotel shuttle bus. I called the hotel twice to ascertain the shuttle's whereabouts, but the shuttle's location remained a mystery.

"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1

"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.

We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!",1

The best part was the chirping throughout the night, from inside the room. The bathroom was not cleaned thoroughly and I was glad to get out of... More",0
Bad: Nothing. Good: Cozy,1

This was in a good location not far from DC. Staff was extremely friendly and efficient. Inside of hotel was nice and breakfast was great.,1
"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

Good: Top of the line..great,1
The property is nice and well located. The water cooler in the fitness center was unplugged and presumably inoperative indicating a lack of attention to detail. The TV does not give access to Root channel which carries the local sports teams currently the Astros. When I asked about this I was told I could come to the lobby and watch... More,1
"We have previously stayed at the Palms Hotel with a beachfront room, but they are closed all summer for renovations, so we went a couple of buildings down to Seaside Inn expecting a smaller room but similar accommodations, so much of this critique is comparing Seaside to the Palms.

"I arrived at this hotel during a work trip at 1 am. I encountered brown water coming from the sink and several cockroaches in the hallway. I slept there because I had nowhere else to go. In the morning I informed the staff. I received no apology, no refund and no follow-up phone call. Need I say more",0
"The Omni Royal Orleans is a great place to stay in the French Quarter. A great, safe location near all of the action and within walking distance of many great restaurants. Rooms were very clean and quiet. The Rib Room restaurant has a good menu and the food is very good.",1
Great staff and well taken care of facility!,1
"Excelente! Fui por 8 dias y 7 noches. Un servicio muy bueno, los desayunos calientes, limpieza del cuarto excelente y todos los dias realizaban limpiezas en los cuartos.

"This extended stay accommodation is perfect. The location of the hotel will take you to any point in the DC Metropolitan The greatest thing in this hotel is the staff lead by Ms. Julia Hanson-Takyi, General Manager.

It was very quiet. Breakfast was the same thing everyday.,1
Good: Right off strip with all extras included in room price,1
clean room but not a good one...over the mechanical room and noisy.....broken shower head bracket which fell on my wife's foot....impossible to get breakfast in the morning with long line up and no food...no front desk support to solve problems,0
"Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay. We are delighted to hear the kitchen in the guest room supplied everything you needed and found the complimentary morning breakfast impressive. Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident. This issue will definitely be addressed in order to prevent this from happening again in the future, please accept our apologies. In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish. We apologize if this was not offered to you upon check-in. Again, thank you for your review of the hotel as these reviews assist us in continuously looking at ways to enhance the stays of all our current and future guests.",1
Nice hotel and perfect location with easy access to ATL domestic and international terminal. Great staff and facilities. Rooms are spacious and good wifi. Amenities are great for a very reasonable price.,1
Great rooms at a very good prize. Very Nice atmosphere in this hotel. Grand lobby. Friendly staff. Short distance to dining. Enjoyed the stay in this hotel. They had a great pool. I would recomend this hotel.,1
"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning!

"This was the absolute worse stay at a motel I have ever experienced. We told the owners that we were looking to stay between one and two months.

"We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big.",0
"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!",0
"Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute.",1
"The room was smaller than expected for the price paid per night. We have stayed at Indy for the motorcycle races and paid less for a much bigger room. It was also further from the Indy Race track then expected. Room was clean, comfortable, breakfast good.",1
"Paying for parking, I thought parking was included. Breakfast was great, waffles, Western omelet, yogurts, fruits. Loved the coffee access.",1
Great Room. Big.,1
"The room was satisfactory. The towels were good, but the bed linen was thin and flimsy, down to the polyester base. Newer, more substantial sheets would be a big plus.",1
"Awesome hotel. Breakfast unbeatable. I love the fact that they really honor the BW Rewards program. Excellent clean suites. Enough parking available next to your room. Tremendous restaurant to choose close to the hotel, an enormous luxury mall and a beautiful movie theater.",1
"I absolutely positively enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I highly recommend it. That guy John W. At the front desk is the greatest love his positive energy and his enthusiastism he made my day. The price is definitely right!!! Rooms are very spacious and well put together...I'll definitely be back",1
"Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good.",1
We stayed one night at this hotel. It seems to be an older hotel that has been remodeled. The rooms are large and clean and the doors to the rooms are outside there is no central hall.

The accommodations were lovely and the view was spectacular. You can go to the 2nd floor and view the personal planes take off. We weren't able to go to their dinner since they are closed on Mondays. 8 min away from downtownThank you for choosing The Hangar Hotel for your anniversary! We hope it was the best one yet. We appreciate you taking the time to post your review. Come back and visit us soon!,1
"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too.",1
"If you haven't been to Cooperstown before - especially during summer tourist season - you need to know that lodging within the village itself is at a premium - very limited availability, and what is available is very pricey.

"The facility was clean, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast was a perfect start to our day. Usually when they say free breakfast its just continental but there were eggs and sausage and waffles too. The picture of the room is exactly what you get. We even had little towel animals in the bathroom.",1

Whilst the inn is showing signs of aging, our experience... More",1
The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.,0
"I called to inquiry about rates direct to the hotel. I mentioned I had dogs, and asked if there were extra charges for this. I was given a rate and I said I would check around for the best deal. The next day I was called by Susie at the front desk said she could do a better rate and... More",1

"We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast.

"Just a quick one night stop over for our family. But the beds were very comfortable, and the hotel in general felt recently renovated and nice. The staff was very friendly. There was more noise than I'm used to at hotels from people walking around in the room above us and people slamming the doors in the hallway early in the morning. Some minor things that didn't bother us in this one night stayover, but maybe in a longer stay, we were missing a microwave in our room and either a large picture or mirror on the wall as there were metal picture hanging brackets and nothing on them.",1
Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there,1
Our first time back since the new owners took over. The small changes in decor are nice to see but am hoping for more updates soon. Revamping the entrance and new chairs would help the atmosphere.

"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!",1

I expected the rooms to be as good as the standard of the lobby, the dining area and the pool area. Good: Excellent breakfast. The outside facilities, lobby and the pool area are very good.",1
"I am a tried and true Marriott person, but my husband booked this hotel as a surprise for our anniversary. He did a great job! The king suite had alot of room, a nice view and a fireplace. The staff was very nice and the breakfast bar was very good. This is a good hotel to stay at if you... More",1
"Basic, clean stay. Included breakfast which was a nice surprise, especially before a two day mountain bike race. Convenient to the bike park, restaurants nearby were satisfying, good value overall. Would stay again.",1
"I recently stayed at the Days Inn in Glen Burnie and I really appreciated its location in relationship to the airport (BWI) and shopping malls, which was the intent of my trip. The staff was great the facility was above my expectation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone just looking for a place to lay your head.",1
"This hotel is in a good location near Restaurants, grocery and retail stores. Clean rooms with refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, safe, work desk, couch and table. A fair size dining area next to the lobby where complimentary breakfast is served. The dining area is also available to meet family or network w business throughout the day after the breakfast meal.... More",1

"We stayed at the Sleep Inn in Van Buren over Thanksgiving while in town visiting family. We booked it last minute at a great rate from the hotel's website. I travel a lot (mostly pleasure, some business) and stay at a wide range of hotels and resorts. I stay wherever is appropriate for the type of traveling I'm doing. On... More",1
"The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me.",1
"The location, staff and hotel are fabulous! The hotel was full but I would've never known. It was quiet in the hallways. Everything is right on point. I travel a lot and this is my new favorite spot in NOLA!",1
"My husband and I chose this location for a mid-winter get away and were pleasantly surprised at the comfort we received at Hampton by Hilton. From the moment we walked into the door, where digital check in meant we were in our room in record time until check out we felt we were home ... Loved the chocolate chip cookies... More",1

"My wife and I selected this hotel to attend a Cowboys game. This hotel was reasonably priced, was convenient to expressways, restaurants and shopping, free wifi, parking and breakfast. Breakfast consist of eggs, sausage, a variety of breads, bagels, doughnuts, juices and milk. The staff was pleasant and helpful. My room had modern decor, a 42 inch TV, spacious room... More",1
"This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!",1
Bad: a pool would be a plus.the bathroom was too little. Good: the room was comfortable and excellent location. Good value for the money,1
"PRO -The room was very clean, but old which was consistent with many review I read prior to booking. -The cost was reasonable for the location. -The location was convenient CON Some upgrades were needed, such as: -an exhaust fan for the bathroom - the steam would condense on the ceiling where some mold/mildew and grown, and this liquid mixture would drip down from the ceiling. -the high speed wireless internet was slow and intermittent. My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested. I might stay there again, but I would not get the breakfast or stay in a room with bathroom mildew.",1
Not to cleanest or the dirtiest. Great breakfast buffet. Nice staff.,1

"I arrived at the Hilton Garden Inn (HGI) Oklahoma City - Bricktown with the expectations that all HGI's are roughly the same. This location proved me wrong.

"We rested here for the night on New Years Eve. It was a easy find and had affordable rates. Can't complain about the room for the price. The bathroom was a bit small and the double queen beds wasn't the biggest, but it was a comfortable place to spend NYE with the family.",1
"It's a clean place with friendly service. The bed was amazing.

"Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river. I would stay there again without hesitation.Hello nchat1,Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience. We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off! We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!",1
All was good except the breakfast. No options at all. Left and went to Ihop!!!,1
"The staff was helpful, even to repair a flashing light on fire alarm. The rooms were clean and spacious. Loved the door between bedroom and sitting room. There are restaurants in walking distance, which means you don't have to drive to get a meal. Breakfast was nice! I recommend this, especially the price.",1
"Our room was nice, clean and comfortable. We have stayed here previously and can tell they have done a few updates. All the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. The breakfast area is a bit disorganized and cramped. Food was OK, but nothing exciting. The hotel is well located and convenient to get downtown or anywhere else. We had... More",1

"My daughter and I stayed here for a Mother's Day getaway. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're here when they have the Napa Farmers Market located at the edge of the parking lot. There is also a nice movie theater in the same parking lot. This is a new hotel with a nice layout. The housekeeping needs some improvement both in the rooms and the breakfast area. They do offer free wine tasting in the evenings which was nice.",1
"Great budget hotel with fridge, microwave, and free wifi. Free breakfast is good but no thrills. Owner is real nice. Great alternative to all the other high price hotels in the area if you need a basic clean place to stay.",1
"This was out third Christmas at Blue Harbor, last year and this year we have noticed that things have gone down hill. This year our Condo was not cleaned very well. Dirty carpets, dirty oven, dirty refrigerator, no soap or shampoo in bathrooms. The water park is showing a lot of wear and needs updating and cleaning as well.",1
Our flight got in late so we needed a place to stay. They sent a shuttle to pick us up at 12:30 AM. They gave us a double bed for my little one and had breakfast in the morning. It's clean with good staff. Plenty of parking. We also got a late checkout.,1
Good: Best breakfast I ever had!!!,1
"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!",1
"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!",0
"This hotel was wonderful. The views were amazing and everyone was so nice. We even had one of the maintenance men stop traffic to let us out of the parking lot (Gatlinburg traffic is not fun). This hotel was a great location to everything. The strip was within walking distance. We didn't have to drive in Gatlinburg, only to Pigeon... More",1
"This had to be the worst Crown Plaza I have ever stayed. I stayed 2 nights to attend a wedding and I didn't sleep at all.

Good: Convenient and clean,1
"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager",1
This was a convenient stop on our way from Indiana to Florida. It is a handy Off and On to I-77. The hotel is in top shape and our room was large and comfortable. The bed was one of the best we have had in a hotel. We would be happy to stay again.,1
"Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again.",1
It was good all but the a/c not working properly but no parking,1
"The Positives: Most of the staff was very friendly. Good location. Hotel clean. Beds comfortable. The Negatives: Too expensive for what you get. Breakfast was just OK No coffee in the breakfast area or choice of milk with cereal. Had to wait a long time for items to be refilled. Bathrooms small. Stingy on the towels. Lobby very small, not... More",1
"Bad: Did not like the fact that there was no restaurant on premises. Good: I love the rustic modern decor, the size of my room and bathroom. Also, front desk staff was very friendly.",1
The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.,0
"I have stayed here many times. It is always very clean, friendly, and affordable. Its a pretty new facility but the prices are still low. My favorite thing is that they don't have FOX NEWS on in the lobby so I don't have to listen to hate speech while I get my breakfast.",1
"L'hotel en lui-meme n'est pas trop mal, les chambres aussi mais l'environnement n'est pas terrible. C'est une zone en bord d'autoroute, dans un suburb glauque, et quand meme tres loin du centre de Washington (30-40 minutes en voiture). De la fenetre de la chambre, vous avez la vue sur l'autoroute ou le toit de l'hotel avec plusieurs grosses climatisations qui tournent en permanence, d'ou un un bruit incroyable ! On se croirait encore dans l'avion.... Pas de restaurant digne de ce nom autours. La piscine est limite propre (l'eau est quasi opaque....) et praticable, bien que tres grande et surveillee. En revanche, le petit-dej est correct !!",1
Check in was quick. There is one elevator in the center of the hotel and stairs at both ends making it very easy to get up and down. Our room had 2 queen beds. The beds were very comfortable and very clean. The bathroom too was very clean and modern. The hotel has a lot of parking and parking is... More,1

"We had a family reunion and everyone had a great time. The lobby had a lot of room with comfortable seating to hang out as a large group. An attached parking garage and 3 block walk to the light rail, plus many restaurants pubs within walking distance made for an easy home base for our young to old group.",1
Quiet and comfortable stay. Close to major roads but far enough away that you are not disturbed by the traffic.. The staff here was fantastic.

"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience.

Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space,1
"Cleaning staff takes pride in their work and it shows. Clean, friendly, updated, warm and nice pool area!",1
The hotel was beautiful inside now can't wait to go back again this summer. The atrium balcony is a must.,1
"Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep. We could not have found a better place. Wonderful staff, what was left. Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast. The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room. Easy on and off I 94. 10 day road trip and this was one of the best.",1

Restaurant food was excellent. I hated to pay the 9.95 extra for the Internet per night,1
Thats it,1
"HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com",1
Bad: Nice hotel in LV close to everything. Good: Everyyhing,1
I don't stay in hotels much. I was just looking for a cheap place to stay to visit relation in the area..,1
THIS place was and absolute DUMP ! ! ! They are in the middle of renovating and they tried to put me in a room that had not been renovated yet. EVERYTHING AND EVERYPLACE you look the place is FILTHY ! ! ! Motel 6 would even be a better place to stay than this place ! ! ! !... More,0
Bad: Had a couple of glitches getting the room serviced but otherwise very friendly and helpful staff. Good: Great location. Nice rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed.,1
Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.,1
After traveling all over Colorado I'd have to say that Crested Butte is one of the prettiest places in the state. The Inn at Crested Butte is two blocks off the main drag and in a perfect location to be quiet but close enough to everything.

"Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty.",1
"Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.",1
"If you're in Edison for whatever reason, this is the first, last and only hotel to consider staying at. Free parking, free wifi, free shuttle, free treats in the lobby, and friendly staff, I have NO negative complaints about this hotel. I loved my stay here!",1

We did a girls night there and it was our first time staying. The location is easy to find and great parking. Once we entered the hotel it felt like you were in someone's home. The front desk staff was so wonderful and helpful planning our night out. They leave no attention to detail unnoticed. We started our night out... More,1

This Holiday Inn Express was very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The location was right off I-40. You can take the rear exit and cross the highway to eat a fantastic meal at Saltgrass Steakhouse. The Holiday Inn offers Wine and beer and snacks in the lobby 5:30-7:30 pm. The next morning enjoy a really good cup of coffee.... More,1
The toilet made a loud noise when it flushes and when the next door room flushed as well. Couldn't sleep all night and when we told the front desk no even apologized nor tried to compensate us for our inconvenience.,1
Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!,1
Bad: I expected to have a much larger room that looks more like a suite.,1
"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner.",0
"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",1
Hotel is very nice and cozy. Rooms are clean and good sized. Great friendly staff despite how very busy they were. Lobby was a nice place to relax and socialize with our friends. Very close to the Metro connectivity. really enjoyed our stay,1

"Nicely situated in downtown Silver Spring within walking distance of the revitalized shopping/restaurant district. We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either.",1
My family and I were in the Richmond area for the NASCAR race. We made a reservation close to some family friends in Midlothian at this Sleep Inn. We are so glad that we did.

My guest room, as well as bathroom are extremely clean!... More",1
"The place is not in the greatest location, but the room is comfy, the breakfast is hot and the staffs are friendly. It seems there are a lot of people going there on weekends because I passed by it a lot of times on weekends and the parking lot always seems full.",1
"We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip. Great price on hotel website, and room was new and clean. My son liked the pool, and it was nice to have complementary waffles and fruit for breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpful. There were a couple of shady characters hanging around outside, but we never felt unsafe. I have a feeling this area might not be the best part of town.",1
"I was checked in by a young lady who did not welcome me and was talking to other staff while checking me in. She gave me a room key that did not work.

Good hotel for the price. Good rooms with nice views-unsafe location that's why there is a shuttle from the hotel to the 15 minute walk subway station. Very Very basic and boring breakfast (eggs-potatoes-waffle-tea-coffee).,1
"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.",0
So many of these hotels act like they are doing you a favor for letting you stay with them. This hotel was truly a friendly and accommodating place with a nice friendly gentleman who welcomed me and a wonderful young lady who checked me out. The rooms are missing a microwave that is about it.,1
"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful.",1
"ote: 3 stars means a slightly above average grade, similar to a C+ in academics As most reviews note, this is a very historic/rustic building and thus should not be directly compared to other modern 4 diamond hotels with much newer buildings, plumbing, furniture, etc. That said, once you get past the lobby of the Benson, the concern to keep... More",1
To say that the hotel was sub-par would be an understatment. The parking was good (though it was a really hard turn off from the road). The front desk staff was mostly friendly (one of the ladies in particularly was amazing). When we were going to our room we had to go through the pool area. The pool was alright... More,0
"Wanted to stop at the recommended Best Western in Santee, but ...there was no room at the Inn. So we continued south and our GPS took us to this hotel. My wife was reading some of the reviews, which were not favorable but found our room clean, roomy and what was to be expected for a one night stay. Granted,... More",1
"don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for.",0
A few miles west of I-75. Near restaurants and mall. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Hotel appeared to be fairly new. We had a king bedded room with sofa bed. For this area a car is needed.,1
"We enjoy the stay, we can visit all museums but for next time",1
"Great stay! We spent the night here on way down to Atlanta. We arrived late and we didn't have reservations, they had king suite available which we took. The room was very nice, spacious, very clean, comfortable bed. The check in staff was very friendly and helpful. Hot breakfast in the morning was good, nice selection-scrambled eggs, sausage patties, biscuits,... More",1
"We wanted to be able to walk to all Seattle's many attractions because we had been told parking is a problem. This fit the bill. Four short blocks from Pikes Market. Walking distance from Space Needle, Pioneer Square and Ferry Terminal for anyone who likes to walk. Mostly flat except for last block going down to Pikes Market.",1
"When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had.",1
"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.",1
We had another fabulous week at the Walkabout. Sherry kept our room immaculate. Veronica was extremely pleasant and helpful. We really love this place and have come back at least twice a year for the last five years. The people watching is beyond words. We walk to all types of restaurants on the Broadwalk. The ocean is steps away and... More,1
This hotel is excellent for the rate. Clean and quiet for the class of hotel. Everybody in the group had the same opinion and wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Easy on and of the highway with plenty of good restaurants close.,1
"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM... More",1
We were in town visiting family--we booked our room online which is so convenient. This motel is very clean with friendly staff. Our room was very quiet--complimentary snacks were out upon our arrival. We would not hesitate to stay here again.,1
"We have stayed at the Warner many times. Always clean, very helpful staff and right in downtown West Chester, close to everything. Limited parking on site but discount parking available near by. Lots of nice shops and restaurants , just walk out the front door. They tend to fill up fast so book early.",1
"Bad: The valet parking was confusing. We ended up just using a parking lot around the corner. For the amount that we paid, I would hope that there would be free parking somewhere in the vicinity. Good: The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very friendly.",1
"Room was clean and comfy, close to food and shopping. Great for weekend or business travellers .",1
The kids loved the water slide in the pool area. Very clean. Great Guest Service all staff were very friendly. The internet connection was not the greatest but since it did not cost anything it was not a big deal.,1
"My husband and I have been coming to Atlanta for years to visit First Baptist Atlanta Church. We have always stayed at the Hampton Inn-Perimeter Center on Hammond Dr., and we've never been disappointed! The accommodations here are always very clean and spacious, the breakfast is quite good, the staff is always super friendly and helpful, parking is right at... More",1
Good: Everything,1
"As other reviewers stated, the staff here is awesome. I've stayed in five-star resorts that didn't have this level of customer service. It's a shame they have to work in a facility that they have to make excuses for. The elevator was broken 95 of the time we were here. I had a bad knee and my 82 year old... More",1
"Now has new owners and managers and it is getting BETTER! Have stayed here a few years in a row, it is a nice little place accross from the beach and close to everything! It needs a little TLC, but I think the new manager will get things done! can't wait to come back next year!!",1
"In town for a sizeable training conference and was able to compare my hotel with the four other approved locations. This one was tops in upkeep, housekeeping, staff and price. Recommend you make your reservation as soon as you know your dates and then keep checking up to 72 hours within check-in. That's how I saved half the original cost.... More",1
"I did not want to write a review when we first stayed as the owner told us he had just lost his wife. We stayed one night because of that..however the room was very, very shabby. The outside door offered little to no security...perhaps a closet door. The room was dingy and small. The kitchen had a tiny fridge w/half... More",0
Hotel lobby and common areas looked like they had not been vacumed in days. Room was a little better but found pieces of candy on the floor. The cooked portion of the breakfast looked too cold and rubbery. Could not bring myself to try it. The neighborhood was OK but views were looking directly into mid-rise apartment units. When we checked in the young lady manning the registation desk looked and sounded like she had the flu. No one else was there to help.,1
Front desk was not helpful. Never told me breakfast was free in resturant. I found this out the second night I was there when a different person was at the desk. Dead bolt did not work but someone did fix it.,1
"If you're looking for the grand ole lobby type place like you stayed with your granny, this ain't it. You walk in from the street or from the porte-cochere and right to the Check-In desk on your right, or the Concierge veering left. If you walk straight ahead there's a nice restaurant. Check-in is friendly and efficient and if you... More",1
"I booked last min, the night before. It showed Family Suite. It was still cheaper then most everything in the area. Booked on TripAdvisor reviews and location. Checkin was at 3pm, as shown. There was a small glitch with my room key working, but they ran a new key to me while I was at the door. The room was... More",1
"Bad: Our AC was not working but they provided us with a portable fan, which helped. It was nice they provided water and snack bar was stocked with a variety of things. Good: Central to lots of sites and walking around is convenient",1

"I have a very picky family, when it comes to hotels, and this hotel delivered. Friendly staff, easy check-in/check-out process, and really comfy rooms. A recommended hotel for business or family travelers! Good location too!",1
"The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is.",1
"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!",1
"Hotel is in a great location, easy walk to inner harbor. Plenty of restaurants to chose from as well. Staff was super friendly, let us check in early and kept our bags after checkout.",1
"First, the hotel does not have an elevator in case that would an issue We have had the same room both times and have always felt comfortable. ...the front desk is very friendly and accommodating ...breakfast is standard...but fit our need...beds are comfortable and pillows are like cloud puffs. ..room shows signs of wear but clean. ..all the staff are...

"Excellent service, clean, nice rooms, great breakfast! The hotel is located near a large mall, food choices and convenient to I65 highway. A very good hotel and a great price. Don't hesitate to stay here at all!",1
"Clean, very nice staff, comfy beds and pillows. Hot breakfast. A very nice place close to the airport and it has free shuttles. (Did not partake in that service). Everything in the room worked flawlessly.",1
"Bad: Room was a little tired. One of the reading lights was coming off the wall, the seat cushion on the desk chair was peeling, the electric outlet near the bed was a tangle of multi-prong extenders. Good: Great location, close to theater district and a short walk to Quincy Market, Aquarium, North End.",1
"Our stay was fantastic, our room had a wonderful view of downtown Atlanta! Everyone was very hospitable, room was clean and comfortable. A special thanks to Mr. Gary Thomas for making sure the our stay was fantastic until the minute we pulled away from the hotel parking.",1
"Love staying here. Frequent this location for work. All of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Room is always exceptionally clean. They have free beer, wine, and food on some weeknights. Will keep coming back for sure!",1
Good: The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked for directions. It was a wonderfully clean room that fit 5 of us perfectly.,1
"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.",1
"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average. Dear Billy R, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your stay with us at The St. Regis New York. We strive to provide world-class service to each and every guest during his or her time with us, and regret to discover that we have failed to meet the high standard we set for ourselves while you visited our landmark hotel.After reading your feedback, we will be sure to address the issues that arose during your stay as to offer the best experience possible to future guests, of which we hope you will be one. We welcome the opportunity to discuss additional thoughts on your stay as to best address the complaint you raised moving forward. Please contact me at Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"Hotels.com had a good price vs. what the hotel wanted for one night over the labor day weekend. This is a good value if you spend in 100/ night range. The staff was accomodating to my early check-in request, breakfast was alright, and noise level was surprisingly quiet. All-in, a good experience.",1
Stayed at the hotel for one night on our last road trip. Found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our only problem is that the hotel is about 10-12 miles outside of Ashland and there are not many restaurants or gas stations around. The staff kindly told us the best places around Ashland and we drove back into the city... More,1

"Great room, breakfast . . . easy access to everything we were up to while visiting our children!",1
"Staff very friendly and check in was fast and efficient. Breakfast was one of the best I have seen at a motel Very clean place all around, from room to breakfast area. Very close to Lambert's Cafe which is a destination restaurant. If you are in this area STAY HERE, you will not be disappointed.",1
"Everyone at this hotel was top notch. Very friendly, personable, accommodating and helpful. The suite was more than expected and pleasantly satisfying. The only thing I'd improve on is the lighting in the room.",1
"We had an outstanding time here, right near the beach and minutes from the Boardwalk. We would recommend this hotel to anyone",1
Seems like an older hotel but clean and comfortable with good service. The one thing that threw us off was that we were expecting the usual breakfast buffet but instead received vouchers for a specific breakfast or 5 off any menu item at Perkins next door. The kids got anything off the kids' menu for free. It was a good deal but disconcerting.,1
"We had a terrific stay at Lafon Motel. Staff members were nice, full cable, and a great pool. Terrific place at a Terrific price.",1
"Booked this hotel as the rate was competitive and I like the option of having a complimentary breakfast. Used the online check-in for the first time, so keys ready and waiting on arrival and straight to my room. All was as you would expect from a Hampton Inn, no complaints at all. The Gym had plenty of space with a... More",1
The location is the best thing about this hotel. The walls are pretty thin so noise can be a problem. But what can you expect from a moderate/lower priced hotel,1
"Rooms are clean with basic amenities, but very dated. Beds are comfortable, rooms are fairly quiet, but can definitely hear through the walls. Breakfast is very basic, but fresh. While it is not very close to an amenities, it is good for pre or post cruise stay. Hotel charges 8 per person for ride to cruise ship terminal",1
"Good: I liked the uniqueness of the hotel, and especially the rooms. Great view out our balcony.",1
"Our room was fairly modern, good cable tv, and clean, We didn't have parking problems as some have, but it is so true that the entrance is near-impossible to find the first time. There's a large neon sign that points toward it, but the actual entrance (a few hundred yards away) is not lit. By all means pay the extra... More",1
"Small hotel which made it nice. Not a lot of people all over the place. Rooms very clean and spacious with balconies in every room. Every room had beach view. Not on the beach, it's separated by the boardwalk. In which you come out of your room and you are right there with all the activities and restaurants. Very nice night life, and the beach is still right there. I do recommend this Hotel",1
"Bad: Nothing, we had an amazing trip!. Good: The staff were all incredible! So friendly and helpful. The bed was like heaven to sleep on, it was so comfortable. I loved the size of the room and the bathroom. Very impressed with this hotel",1
Just wonderful,1
We enjoyed out stay. If ever back in the area again we would most definitely reserve a room again. We loved the sitting area and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was really good and a variety of selections to choose from. The hotel staff particularly the gentleman that checked us in was AWESOME. Most definitely a people person and seems to love what he does. Ensuring the guest is comfortable,1
Hotel check-in and check-out is efficient. Common areas and rooms are well maintained. Staff was inconsistent in terms of friendliness. Room's window heat/air unit was a bit noisy for me - but I'm a light sleeper. Breakfast was acceptable - fairly standard for this type of hotel. Had issues with the Internet connection speed.,1
easy check in good breakfast clean rooms nice large bathroom,1
"Great selection of beers on tap. Salads are fresh and tasty, burgers and sandwiches are okay but too much grease. Ordered Teriyaki bowl swimming in oil like a stew - returned it.",1
"I agree with most of the comments from the other reviewer (MKEcritic). I gave it 4 stars because our room was clean and comfortable and the motel well met our limited needs. Other travelers would see it differently. It all depends on what you are looking for. If all you are looking for is a clean room to stay, then... More",1

Third time visiting this hotel!! Great stay will come again!! Real close to Riverbanks zoo!!,1
"Perfect for pets, nice pool",1
"Good: Very friendly staff, quiet and so close to beach and the lively Ocean Drive. Nice pool at the top. Glass of wine for the guests. Good food!",1
"Large room and reasonable price. However, old building, needed updating. Breakfast same everyday. No spa tub. Worked for us as we knew we would only be there to shower and sleep and was close to the University where we were visiting our son.",1
"Let me say upfront that this could have been a 4 star resort. Gave it three due to the treatment we received upon arrival. We arrived early to the Konea tower, knew a room would likely not be ready and even said to the lady working we know we're early. The front desk clerk proceeded to curtly (and that's using... More",1
Overall great stay. Clean modern hotel with friendly staff. Free internet. Very nice breakfast with individualized orders. Rooms were very comfortable and modern. Bathroom spacious. My first stay in Aloft hotels. Will return to this chain.,1
The front desk staff was not good. Tried to leave a wakeup call two nights in a row. Went down to the front desk about 9 pm could not find anyone. Checked out at 4:30 am no one at desk or available.,1
Good: Courteous and helpful staff! Excellent location. Close to prudential and shopping. Highly recommend,1
"We took a 3 week driving tour of the West and national parks. I wish they had a Sunshine Inn in every town. That said, this place is not for everyone since it's not hip or updated. It's just cheap, clean, and the bed was the most comfortable of the trip. We saved 100 here over what we had to... More",1
"Excellent site for our recent sibling reunion as the family that was once from Dayton converged from different parts of the country. Front porch reminded us of the one at The Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island with the rocking chairs. Nice that you can have meals on the porch also. Staff was top-notch, food in the restaurant was tasty and... More",1
"Friendly desk clerk gave me clear directions to my room and how to use the wifi. The clean room with fridge and microwave was a pleasure, the price a bargain. I enjoyed opening my door to the courtyard trees. The hotel is just off the main drag surrounded by trees and a touch of nature. I only wish more or the exercise room equipment worked.",1
"Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing.",1
I really enjoyed myself. Wish they offered more discounts,1
Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.,1
"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City.",1
"Good: From the room, to the staff to the location.....this hotel has it all... and who doesnt like breakfast that is served until noon....i was a little worried at first, because i couldnt believe the deal we got for a hotel in SoBe....but everything was just PERFECT....",1
Bad: the valet could have been better. certain employees appeared to hate their job and the visitors. Good: the bed was very comfortable. the best sleep I've had in a while. the location was perfect as well.,1
"Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!). Shower had nice pressure, and the beds were firm but not hard. We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful.",1
"The staff was awesome! They gave me a free upgrade to a kids suite. The free breakfast left a little to be desired - (those were bran muffins - not chocolate) Room was nice and clean, the location was perfect for our trips to Disney.",1

Dirty, no good, a waste of money. Even for a single night. The first night I stayed, my dog found a piece of a crack pipe. She... More",0
Very good place to stay,1

"After two nights of tenting and driving, my son and I drove in with low expectations but a craving for some internet (our phones barely worked during most of our U.P. trip!)

"I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel in Eau Claire. None of the staff have any idea whats going on when you check in.

"Compared to our stay in Washington DC and Savannah, both of which were historic buildings, the hotel did not meet our expectations. It was very expensive and although it was an historic hotel, room was dated and needed an update.",1
"I stayed here because the location is close to all the attractions, restaurants, and beaches. The bonus is the low price compared to all the other motels in the area. It is clean, nicely furnished and a very friendly staff. I recommend this motel highly",1
"I know you will think this review is too good to be true but this hotel is one of the best we have ever experienced. Front desk staff was great, rooms were spacious and comfortable. And the evening free drinks reception, WOW! Breakfast, with eggs cooked to order, fresh fruit and other food was fantastic. I can not say enough... More",1
Great stay. I have no complaints. Me and my family were very pleased and would have love to stay longer. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any and everyone.,1
The grounds for the hotel was ok....I feel they should advise you that part of the motel is across a 4 lane road...and the rooms can be a lot cleaner than they were. There was what looked like dog hair all along the window sill. The room we stayed in (114) could be set up a lot differently the kitchen/living... More,0
"The hotel is OK, decent bed but very old decor and cheap, can not find place to put bath amenities, there is one small sink which has no space. The housekeeping does not change sheet everyday, she cut herself and left all her bloody on the sheet and comforter, so terrible. Overall the room looks cheap....Would not go back.",1
"Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk.",1
"Was a great 1 night stay. Lobby was beautiful, very clean, nice personable staff. Rooms were very nice! Wish they had an option for a room w a King bed and a sofa bed, we needed to get the rollaway, which was ok, but only sleeps 1. Pool was nice, kids enjoyed for a bit. Breakfast buffet was great! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to those looking for a nice place to stay.",1
Its well worth what you pay. The pool is the hugest I have seen at a hotel! The staff is polite and friendly. Some kinda shortage of housekeepers and waited two hours on checking into a reserved room. Once there it was good we booked a double with a kitchenette. Spacious and convienient. Will be returning.,1
"We stayed at this motel for 5 months. The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy. We complained about the lighting several times, and also our neighbor's squeaky door without results. Finally we just gave up, and lived with it. We checked... More",0
"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"We were just staying overnight en route to the Bahamas. When we arrived at nearly 1 am, we discovered that our reservation did not exist, our travel provider had instead booked us into a hotel in Baltimore in April.

"This Drury is in a good location , right off 77, for a stop when driving south to Fla or Hilton Head. The staff is friendly, food is good. Breakfast has hot and cold selections, fruit and cereal.

We were in town for a wedding and this location was chosen by the bride and groom for the people coming in for the wedding. We have never been disappointed at Hampton in the past and we were not disappointed this time. The only thing difficult with this hotel was getting to it.,1
"We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.",0
"Travelled with family of 4 (children 9 5). Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with partial ocean view. The apartments are very spacious and well appointed. After seeing other reviews on this web site regarding privately owned apartments, I actually rented our apartment through a separate web site to the resort itself. This web site has numerous privately owned... More",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Very friendly personnel at the reception. Breakfast was good lots of choices. Beds had excellent matrasses. Ony 10 minute drive to Disney parks. Lots of restaurants nearby.,1
"The hotel, totally remodeled since my last visitlast summer, looked much better than ever. The price was just right and I totally needed the rest after working so hard on my job,",1
"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff.",1
Bad: Heating Systems make noise. Breakfast was OKish. Good: Well placed for visiting downtown museums etc.,1
Nice property and rooms but the service was awful. Hard to get attention from front desk. Multiple requests needed to get issues resolved. It's a big hotel but doesn't have the customer service needed.,0
"A little pricy, but it was 4th of July weekend so we totally understand. But the price was well worth it. Martha at the front desk was great! Excellent customer service from her! Always smiled and was so helpful. We loved this hotels location too. We will be back soon .",1
This hotel is a great place for a relaxing family getaway. Just steps away from the soft sand beach. The pool is great. The staff are professional and friendly. I am particular about cleanliness and service but found this hotel satisfying in all areas.,1
"The Breakfast staff were beyond wonderful. The Front Desk staff were always helpful and friendly. However, I did have an issue with closing charges that were applied to the card I used as a GTD only, resulting in a credit that seems to be taking forever. The hotel overall was always clean and well maintained. Elevators could have been built a little bigger!",1
"It was perfect for my travel needs for work. Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. If you stay here you have to eat at the Greene Turtle, it's a 1/4 of a mile away with great food.",1
"We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!",1
I was very pleased with the service I was giving the rooms were very clean the bathrooms are very clean hotel in general very clean staff was very nice and helpful The beds were very comfortable very good Wi-Fi signal,1
My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a romantic getaway. All the staff were helpful and friendly and the food was wonderful. It was cool at night so the fires in the fireplaces were welcome and we loved having our own private fireplace in our room. We will try to get back there again.,1
"Good: Nice rooms, good beds and perfect location",1
"I have 4 teens. So there were 6 of us in a room. That get cramped! This two bedroom suite had 2 (!) bathrooms and a kitchen. NO one slept on the floor. It was awesome! Tons of room to spread out, we weren't tripping over each other.",1
"I would recommend staying at this location. The staff were extremely helpful. Rooms are clean, heating system is quiet, beds and pillows comfortable, internet access, and a very breakfast in the morning. Very good quality for your dollar.",1
"Over priced, old, and gross. We arrived in our very small room to towels that someone with a bad cold blew their nose in. Yes, that was left for us. The front desk laughed when they saw it. Maybe they laughed because they had to come back in from smoking to help. The bathrooms are similar to what you'd find... More",0
"The Fairfield Inn Tracy is located close to the highway. Therefore road noise can be heard. However, the hotel is clean and the staff is excellent. The noise will not wake you or annoy you but it is there. Close to shopping and restaurants. The Hampton Inn is across the parking lot and has the same noise issue.",1
Overall very excellent. No negative all positive. I think for the price you can't go wrong. Also it was a quiet atmosphere.,1
Bad: More restaurants. Good: Very friendly staff.,1
"Bad: Hot tub was very dirty, needed a good wash down and no in house restraunt. The station 10 grill associated with property was good but not located within hotel. Good: We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going on for the week we traveled and it's easy access to beach and boardwalk, breakfast was really good, but gotta get up early to avoid long lines.",1
"Hotel is under renovations and you would not know it the way the staff, front desk and sales treated you. The room was great, much space. I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,",0
Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy,1
"This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The whole facility was very well kept and having cold, fruit flavored water available in the lobby was very refreshing in hot July. We would certainly stay here again.",1
"Free parking, Free Wifi. Relative to other similar hotels of this calibre the price was approximately double that of what we were used to be paying. Location wise it was about 10-15 minutes to most sights in the San Diego area. Although rated as a 3 star it felt closer to a 2 star or a Motel in decor and... More",1
"Was looking for a moderately priced hotel in the Queen Anne District, close to Seattle Pacific University for a college preview weekend. Had never stayed here before, but definitely would stay here again! Great location- within walking distance to the Space Needle and monorail which gets you close to other shopping and restaurants. Helpful staff. Clean, quiet rooms. Definitely would... More",1
Only positives to take away from my stay as short as it was. Regular room was move like a mini-suite. Clean and spacious. Free breakfast was good. Small bar area prevented me from having to leave the hotel. Nice touch.,1
"When I brought photos of dried vomit to the front desk they were dismissive. They asked if the sheets were dirty or stained. Need I say more. Sticky stuff on nightstand. Security guards on the floors and security cameras everywhere. Especially as young women, be safe and stay somewhere else.",0

We spent an amazing four nights (thank you Marriott points!) and can't wait to... More",1
"I was recently in Denver for a business conference. Our group had blocked a section of rooms for our stay. I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and and well appointed (refrigerator, microwave, couch, etc). This was a great hotel for the price and I would come back again.",1
Short overnight stay. The staff was great. Very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is a bit dated and in need of a few fixes. Tub and toilet are is very small. So small the door hit the toilet when closing. Overall this was a nice stay. Bed was comfortable. Lots of room space and dog friendly. I would stay here again.,1
"I stayed at this hotel for four nights and enjoyed my stay. The location was convienantly located next to I-95 (although somewhat hard to find the first time due to the congestion of the area) and a 5-10 minute drive to the Franconia-Springfield metro station. The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though.",1
"Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable",1
The property is very nice and well cared for on a daily basis. Complimentary breakfast very good. Staff very friendly. They are rated by AAA. Property to walk around. Restaurants close by with good food. Pool and hot tub. The only problem that I had is that I used a pre paid travel card for the room. They put a... More,1
Bad: Buffet food.,1
"Beautiful hotel, very convenient to the metro in Crystal City. Wonderful complimentary breakfast. Enjoyed manager's reception nightly. Will stay here again - this was our second visit in 5 years to the same hotel. Spacious suites. Nice large flat panel televisions - 2 per suite. Workout room adequate. We had a dead battery in the hotel garage and the guest services attendant helped us find a car service employee who assisted us for no charge! Only suggestion - bathrooms need exhaust fans! I believe they are scheduled to be remodeled soon...",1
"We had a great stay at this hotel! Our room had everything that we needed including coffee pot, microwave and fridge. It was a very clean room and the hotel had a pleasant staff. This hotel is only about 5 minutes from the mall and numerous other stores and restaurants, so very accommodating! I would definitely stay here again!!",1
"I didn't like the size of the rooms, not as big as I thought they would be. I liked the central location to Downtown Boston.",1
"Personnel during our weekend were just great, esp. Ashley Front Desk offering suggestions and answering every single question. NOW! it is difficult to navigate with two towers but, once you get the zoop that the 3rd floor is the skyway - OK / plus, the parking garage is not an EZ lay-out and the schlep to the lobby on...

"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Cheers, Genafer",1
We stayed here for location. Easy access to Asheville and Hendersonville and the NC Arboretum.,1
"hotel in the perfect spot in gatlinburg. very close to everything. breakfast was very good, nice helpful staff.room was alittle dated but everything worked . bed was comfortable.. the ac was cold. the pool was large and clean with lots of seating area.parking wasexcellent",1
Toliet overflowed. Rug remained wet. Carpet wet and smelled moldy in my daughters room. Water in drinking fountain cloudy. Breakfast buffet excellent. Staff friendly and helpful except when the toilet water was running everywhere. Free shuttle to the airport and metro very convenient.,1
We were very pleased with how clean this Super8 was. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The price is great and a good place to stay. We will be back.,1
"Upon Arrival, I was greeted warmly by Ashlee at the front desk. She knew my first name and that we were there for our daughter's weddding! What a difference from the previous two nites we had spent at the Torrey Pines Hilton.I will review that hotel as well.... For me, it is all about service, and I was so impressed... More",1
"Located in the Arena District, walking distance from Arena, many restaurants and pubs. Rooms were typical of a hotel layout. Everyone was nice and attached to a restaurant (Max and Erma's) where you got you breakfast.",1
"I used to live in Clarksville and kind of knew what to expect here Hotel-wise, but was very pleasantly surprised when it came to the staff! EVERYONE we encountered was incredibly nice and accommodating Everything was clean, our room, the pool area, and bar. The beds were fine, bedding looked fairly new...I only had one issue and that was the continental breakfast. It was awful, but then again aren't they all",1

More",1
"This hotel is ok if you need a short stay, mostly for sleeping. I stayed two nights, using the swimming pool once. Cons: The breakfast buffet was of mediocre quality (worst is the pastry, tasteless and more like stale bread) The lobby was hot and humid, and could have been cleaner and neater The path to the swimming pool was horrible, filthy, flooded The pool itself is ok, warm, its floor littered with stuff - there is no change room or shower in the pool area Pros WiFi was of good quality, fast and no issue with login or usage Staff were friendly, helpful The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and neat The fridge and all lighting worked well",1
Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden,1
"This is a great, quiet spot with a view of the bay, the Queen Mary and Long Beach harbor. The water side pool and bar restaurant have amazing views. The rooms was nice and quiet. Although the bathroom is small they are newly renovated.Thanks for the great comments!",1
Stayed two nights in late April. The parking is a little confusing as it is shared with the hotel next door and could use more lighting. The attendance was very pleasant when checking in. The manager was very helpful in the morning pulling additional chairs for the folks to be able to sit in the crowded breakfast area. Clean place.... More,1
"My spouse has eaten here a couple of times in the past, mostly very good experiences, but the last time (a month ago) was very poor.

The hotel staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean and comfortable. It was very quiet. The breakfast was very good with lots of options. They even left organic toiletries in the room!,1
The history of presidents who have stayed here goes way back. The restaurant down stairs is classic old school. Meaning: classy nice great service. Private event ask for the table in the wine room. Also wonderful conference private space for any meal. I like this better than the place at street level. Yes stay here Yes eat down stairs Yes... More,1
"The hotel was very nice. As compared to several other Casinos on the strip the Aria casino had the least offensive smell of cigarettes. The buffet was good but pricey. We went early in the morning would recommend for lunch or supper not breakfast. The concierge was helpful, long line but they placed staff in line to speed up process.... More",1
"Our total experience was excellent. The staff was very friendly, the beds were soft and cozy, and the room was very clean and quiet. The best part of all was the fact we could check in and choose our room online with our iPhone. Physical check-in took a mere few seconds.",1
"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.",0

"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the ARIA. The service, the room and the conference area were great. The room was spacious and very comfortable. I really like that everything was controlled by the tablet in the room. I will stay at the ARIA again when visiting Las Vegas.",1
We just stayed one night but my boyfriend said there was an odor when he first went in. It wasn't a bad hotel. It just needs to updating.,1
Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.,1
My family and i enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and comfy. The staff was very professional and polite. Breakfast was delicious.,1
"Bad: Room is clean, I expected room would be bigger but not,Paid about 230. Good: Good customer service and room is clean",1
We loved everything about this hotel. It's updated and has a fresh 2016 look with brightly colored decor. It was clean and the staff was VERY friendly! The pool was outdoors! The fitness room had everything we needed for some good workouts!,1
Plates outside of hotel room door when we arrived stayed there all day and evening Bed extra comfy. Very courteous staff.,1
"Hotel pulito e comodo, secondo gli standard della catena di cui fa parte, camere ampie e con tutti i servizi. Colazione inclusa, non di eccelsa qualit, ma comunque comoda poich non ci sono bar o locali nelle vicinanze tranne qualche fast food. Puttosto fuori dal centro storico pertanto consigliabile solo a chi dispone di un'auto propria o a noleggio.",1
"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!",1
"This place was awesome. From the moment you step in, and you have fresh-baked cookies and lemonade waiting for you... you know it's going to be a great stay.

"My husband and I were driving cross-country for a move with two cats, so our requirements for lodging were relatively clean, safe, cheap and pet-friendly. This hotel met all of those. The front desk clerk was strangely short with me. I asked him how he was doing and tried to make small talk while he looked up my reservation and... More",1
I visited Lodi on a series of times but my experience at this motel was bad. A lot of noise. The Rooms were Ok but not severely clean. I wouldn't stay here again,0
"love to stay here, really friendly staff. Rooms are run of the mill, but comfy. One of the cheeper hotels in Laughlin. Really like the food choices it is kind of central to other places on the river.",1
Very friendly well staffed. Nice size rooms with wood floors to avoid any doggie odors.,1
Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.,1
"Good: It was a very comfortable hotel,everything was was great",1
Had a Bad experience here. Bugs were crawling up the Curtains and the Cieling. I killed a few and housekeeping didn't even clean the mess. Aweful. I should have take pics.,0
"Great family find. Staff was great! Pool kept kids busy. Eating area is welcoming. Close to all camps in NH and they are very tolerant of kid behavior. Right of highway 89. Nice drive into Concord, the State Capital and good ice cream. And The Candy Shoppe!",1
"This Hampton Inn is just the opposite of the Burbank Hampton. Very friendly staff. Let us check in early without a problem. Clean, comfortable, new - or recently remodeled - room.

Easily accessible to highways shopping. Since I've stayed in this area before I will definitely stay here again.,1

Safe in a bottom drawer ( though we were lucky to find it since no one told us about it). Great amenities- wine and cheese at 5PM, cookies with... More",1
The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.,1
The front lobby was very welcoming and enjoyable. The pool was beautiful. The rooms were very very clean. Convenience having restaurant on site. Location was great and the price was very reasonable. Would stay there again.,1
AC died in the house...used my Hilton honors rewards to get a great rate. The general manager personally called to make sure our stay was going well. Fantastic service from all.,1
At one point I was a loyal repeat customer to this place. Although most would complain about the tacky decor or the dirty burn marked sheets and blankets im not one to make a big deal about it. But until yesterday after I had requested no maid service for my room it was entered by the maid and my stuff... More,0
Truly a nice hotel. People very friendly and helpful.,1
"I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos.",0
Had a great time,1
I had a terrible experience with this hotel. I did not have towel rack or telephone in my room. Also there was an issue with the cleanliness of the room.,0
Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden,1
"My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!",1
"With a few wrinkles here and there, don't be disturbed by the aging exterior. Things are clean and well maintained inside. The staff is super friendly and decidedly helpful.

"Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share.",1
"...without the hassle of being downtown. Nestled in San Marco one block from Hendricks Ave., this cozy little hideaway is well worth looking for. The hotel is just far enough away from the traffic, yet so close to everything if you're willing to be creative. For instance, if you want to head to downtown Jacksonville and the Northbank Riverwalk, you... More",1
My husband will go so far as to say that this is the best hotel in Denton. He loves all the cool things they offer including a texting service to check on you.

"This hotel almost exactly met my expectations. It's huge, has a beautiful setting, wonderful landscaping, and all the amenities you would expect from a giant resort. Also though, as you would expect from a mega resort, there is little personal attention, flexibility, and a general lack of attention to detail. We had an awesome room, Deluxe Ocean Suite, and would... More",1
Bad: Ice maker broke on our floor. Water in lobby not always kept filled. Wasn't always cups available for water. Good: Water in lobby.,1
"Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street.",1
"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed. We will share your kind words with our teams and we are so grateful for your support!We hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"We booked here for a second year in a row. We loved the first time around. The location is perfect, the grounds and pools are great, and Duke's restaurant on the resort grounds fits in well. However, on our second visit in August, the Ocean View room was at tree level, thus no ocean view. The check in desk... More",1
I must not have read any of these negative reviews when I booked this room over a month ago. None of them are exaggerating. We drove out here 4 days before checking in to check it out. I asked to see a room but the desk person said no. I specifically requested a room that allowed us to at least... More,0
Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there.,1
"Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety.",1
"I book a room every year at this time for the Rendezvous usually at the Brisbois Motel.Oh my, I said no way. After trying hotel after hotel, we came here. I was very upset and the lady at the front desk said everything will be fine. She got us in , then was waiting to see if we was going... More",1

"The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!",0
"Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had.",0
"Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge",1
"Bad: I wasn't in love with the location, but it's on a main road with a bunch of similar places. Also, the payment situation was a little annoying, and I wish the chairs outside looked a little cleaner. Although, it rains a lot so I imagine the upkeep is difficult.

My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed.,1

I love where this Hotel is located. It is right next to the Capital Building. It has a nice gym and a nice clean swimming pool indoors.

"We chose this hotel because it accepted our pets. We were on the second floor, and there were no elevators, but that was just a minor inconvenience. I saw the first floor rooms with outside doors that weren't to be used which was a little disconcerting. I did not feel unsafe in the area. The bed was comfortable, and everything... More",1

The 25 inch picture tube television,... More",1

Travelling via Portland we decided to stay at the Benson as 'somewhere different' from the usual run of chain hotels.

I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends.,1

Lovely small hotel in a residential location within easy driving distance of all local amenities and tourist attractions. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is served in on site restaurant which also serves a good choice of evening meals. Would stay again if lucky enough to be in the area.,1
The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.,0
"We were absolutely treated as you would expect...very high end experience with all the right amenities. Golf course is very challenging and cheap if you play in the summer (too hot for most, but get a cart and bring water and it's totally worth it). The rooms were exceptional (amazing views from this slightly perched location) and the service was... More",1
"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star.",0
Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!,1
"Clean, quiet, and spacious rooms with Micro-Fridge in every room. Nice relaxing and appointed rooms with great cable lineup. I will stay here again upon my return. Nice view of the mountains in West Virginia.",1

Free parking ! Very clean room and hotel. Friendly staff. We will definitely stay here again.,1
Up visiting for my son's graduation from Cornell. The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly. We took advantage of the free breakfast and were surprised at how much they offered. We had a one bedroom suite which was great for my husband and myself plus our daughter.,1

"The Hampton Inn in Bow, NH, is a wonderful hotel. Friendly and competent staff, very clean rooms, a very good FREE hot breakfast, and the location is great--easy access to I-93 and I-89. This hotel is very clean, and very modern. Try to do business with front desk employee MELISSA THORPE. She was very helpful and had a great attitude!",1
"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.",0

Stay was great and nice friendly staff.,1

I booked 2 nights. Stayed 1 and got out. I was afraid to shower here. By far the worst place I have ever stayed. My window didn't close all the way. I use the term window loosely. It's basically a dorm room with a rickety door that doesn't close properly. The only redeeming quality is the staff. You leave a... More,0
"The rooms are HUGE. Parking is the cheapest I've seen at any hotel in Arlington. It isn't right in the city, but it is definitely worth the cab (or hotel shuttle ride) into downtown. Always extremely clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really can't say enough. This was my sixth time staying at the Virginian Suites and I keep coming back. Love it!",1
Stayed here for second time recently. Gorgeous lobby. Friendly staff. Good free shuttle service. Our room this time was disappointing.

Great hotel and grounds and easy drive from the airport. One of the nicest hotel chains I have stayed in for this price range.,1
Bad: Coffee could be better quality. Good: The position if the room at the ba k away from the street was excellent. There was no bar so no young noisy people!! Yeah!! The veranda and the garden area was well shaded so could sit out in the cool. Near shops and two minutes to beach.,1
"Due to traffic in South Lake Tahoe preventing us from getting back to SF, we needed a place to stay over night quickly and conveniently. Inn by the Lake was easy to find and a great price! The staff was very friendly even at wee hours in the morning.",1

"Clean, comfortable bed and modern dcor. A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback.

"I have stayed here several times before. Breakfast is above average with a large area. Employees were very nice. The only complaint I had this time around was the extra soft bed. I felt like I couldn't even sit or lay on the end or sides of the bed without feeling like I was falling off, but that's just my opinion. Still a great place to stay.",1

My only issue is that I have expierienced better Wyndham hotels for cheaper prices in my area. Bigger rooms to bigger in-room jacuzzi units to better overall atmosphere to the room. Service or cleanliness was not lacking here just overall quality of rooms compared to other Wyndham hotels.,1
"Linens were dingy, took a while to locate my Reservation although I booked it through the hotel. The housekeeping staff was pleasant. Located in a central area. Overall it was ok confusing though it's situated next to 2 other hotels and a condominium",1
This hotel is convenient to Metro with large comfortable rooms and free breakfast.,1
Great for a short stay close to all,1

"Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!",1

"Great hotel, very friendly desk personnel. You should note online and on phone that your free hotel shuttle is for dfw only. I called and confirmed that I was flying in but no one asked me which airport, I had to take a 30 cab each way. That would have made a difference in my choice of hotels or flights.",1
"Red Roof Inn is 100, smoke free, but that doesn't prevent people from smoking right outside their doors and therefore talking every hour in a half outside your door too and the smell of smoke that surrounds you every time you walk out or in. The room is what you pay for, location is right off the highway so convenient, it is 10 to 15 minutes away from everything.",1
"Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!",1
"The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again.",1
The Dana is a vast property with tremendous views of mission bay. Located right on the bay front with excellent water views. Watersports on site. 2 big pools and 2 hot tubs. They have kids movies in the swimming pool area on certain nights. Cons: - Small bathroom / toilet - Small sink - tiny and located outside the bathroom.,1
"Not only was this a beautiful property but the whole staff: the valet, front desk, sales, food and beverage, A/V Internet departments were so helpful. Even when I screwed something up, they helped me make it look seamless. The food was excellent and the room worked perfectly. Sleeping rooms are beautiful. Ok, the wireless internet speed could of been... More",1
"Counter staff tried to be helpful, however my problem needed the manager's attention. He was not on site, but could be reached by phone, but refused to talk with me.

"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay.",1
"We decided Saturday morning to go to A.C. for the night (from North Jersey)... looked online for a hotel that was reasonably close to boardwalk and casinos and priced below saturday night casino rates... this hotel fit that criteria... 2 blocks from boardwalk... essentially between resorts and ballys... good location (although other reviews are right about strip bars on street between boardwalk and hotel)... hotel is older and no frills - but clean, comfortable (air conditioner in our 4th floor room worked great), and certainly adequate... i would certainly recommend this hotel as a reasonably priced place to spend an overnight",1
"The hotel staff is fantastic. From the front desk to the pools to restaurants, everyone is pleasant, helpful and anxious to be of service. Biggest downside would be the location. It's 30-40 minutes from the nearest good restaurants and after 3 days the in-house restaurants get kind of old. It's a far cheaper option than Four Seasons Scottsdale and offers... More",1
Bad: Very minimal breakfast. Good: Great location.,1
"Great location and good services...Hampton Inn provides an excellent service to its guest, hopefully my Hilton Honors will provide discounts to other properties I plan to vacation during the coming year.",1
"What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional. The breakfast bar was the best breakfast bar I have had in a Hotel. Out of a 1-5, I rate the breakfast bar a 5. The staff were so on point.",1

"I stayed here the night before leaving on a flight from Logan. It's a cute place with a nautical theme,great seaport location. Very clean, and nice rooms with high ceilings. The Black Rose Irish Pub across the street was great as well.",1
"We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.",0
The room was ok. It took 10 minutes for me to check in with no wait. The young lady at desk was apparently occupied in back office. Had to call front desk just so she would come up front. Noticed in my room there was a rag hanging on the shower that had been used and the trash can had trash in it. Went to complain and of course no one was at front desk. Didn't stay the night. Lesson learned,1
"Good price for location - a Midway airport hotel. At about 3 miles distant, it's about 1 mile farther out than the main 'hotel row' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants, grocery stores, etc.The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable, quiet and adequate. No complaints. Nothng to write home about either.",1
Great place and very clean.,1
"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.",0
It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help.,0
"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
"Cannot say enough good about this place! The addition of the peddle boats and paddle boards really seal the deal that this is the best place on Canada Street!

"We booked this room last minute. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The staff were great. I asked for an extra pillow and the gave it to me, no questions asked. Next time we go to the area, we will book a room from them.",1
Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.,1
"While our overall 2 night stay was not unpleasant and the location is excellent if you wish to be in town, there were a few things that would have made our stay much more relaxing while we were there.

This hotel is very clean and comfortable. It appears to be one of the newer Courtyards that feature all of that brand's latest amenities.

"I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you!

"This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.

"Room was clean and efficient. The efficiency apartment layout was nice. Only critique was the faucet on the bathtub dripped, but i just closed the door and it did not bother me. I was too tired at the end of the workday to bother calling in maintenance. Breakfast is sparse, coffee, instant oatmeal, packaged muffins and some fruit.",1
Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights.

We stayed at the King Charles Inn for one night. The staff was very welcoming and accomidating. The manager greeted us and checked on our satisfaction. The location was excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel!,1
"Free parking, included wifi, and one of the best breakfasts I have seen at this type of hotel. What's not to like? The location is pretty convenient, and the pool (while small) is a nice addition. It's not a place to hang around all day, but works great. The rooms also have microwaves and refrigerators.",1
"We had a good stay in this hotel, it was clean and comfortable, everything was ok as far as the basic services, but the wireless internet did not work well at all during our 6 day stay. I would not recommend this hotel if you want reliable wireless internet access, I noticed that other guests had similar issues with the wireless access.",1

Good: All around for value,1
"Love the service and the room was very nice. The only compliant I had is it was very noisy. The air/heat unit made a lot of noise, people slamming doors in the hall and the outside street/parking lot noise was bad.",1
"Went on May 2015. Rest of the DC hotels were either sold out or very expensive. Overall it was ok. Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)",1

"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.",1

Enjoyed a three night stay at this Best Western while in the DC area. Booked two nights originally through Hotels.com and decided to stay one additional night and the staff honored the same price as the original price through Hotels.com. Absolutely the best continental breakfast bar none. Staff was very helpful with touring information and room was very neat and clean. Would definitely stay here again when back in DC area.,1
"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!",1
"Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,.

My fiance I went to visit friends living year round at Riviera Resort Marina. We stayed 3 nights in room 113. The room was everything we needed plus more.

"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once.",1
"My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through.",1
"I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!",0
The hotel was average but the price and location was very good the Hotel was very old like 90is the staff was helpful if u want to go to attend any show at convention centre then u are at right place its also near to strip only waking distance,1
"Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel. We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking. We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,",1
"Nice staff, good breakfast available. Rooms were nice and clean.",1
"This was a planned getaway for 3 sisters celebrating special birthdays. Everything was above and beyond our expectations! We felt like the Innkeepers had thought of everything! We stayed in the Refugio suite which was more than we could have asked for. Lots of room with a beautiful outdoor sitting area overlooking back gardens. A welcoming box of truffles, ... More",1
"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!",1
"We stayed for one night at this hotel during a trip to Nashville during the Rock-and-Roll marathon and our experience was very enjoyable, at a fraction of the cost compared to similar hotels in Nashville. The rooms were very nice, looked new and modern and they were very clean. There are several dining and shipping options in very close proximity.... More",1
"Worst Hotel I've stayed in, Non smoking smelled of smoke and my eyes were burning. They gave handicap room shower head not high enough and no sink in bathroom not what was expected, air conditioning unit noisy horrible",0
"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.",0
Room 11. One queen and a double. Place was clean and the beds are comfortable. I have a brand new Stearns and Foster and I slept just as good here as at home. No amenities but I just wanted a bed for on the way to Pagosa Springs.,1
"A basic, dated motel. On the positive side, it was very welcoming when I arrived and the room was clean and tidy. I can see the (newish) owner have made an effort, but really the property is in need of more upgrading than it's received.",1
"I look for cleanliness when I stay at a hotel. I have no complaints. The room was clean with nice furniture, the bed was so comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and professional with smiles on their faces.",1
"Excellent location on the fringes of an up-scale shopping area and lots of restaurants within walking distance, just off Rt 29/250 By Pass. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with couch and chairs for lounging. The eating area provides a well appointed free breakfast and was perfect for gathering off-hours for a drink from the bar/Starbucks. The staff was bright and... More",1
"We have stayed at this Red Roof Inn a half a dozen times or more because it is convenient, clean, and comfortable. The staff is friendly and they are pet friendly. The breakfast is what you get everywhere else...quick and enough to get you on the road quickly.",1

"Check in process went very smooth, Romano was very friendly and had a lot to offer as far as getting into DC and things to do. The room was clean, beds made nicely, bathroom was a bit small and only 2 large towels so we had to ask house keeping for more, the on duty house keeper didn't speak very... More",1
We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year and we love it. Conveniently located -- 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown - close to shopping (Whole Foods) and a great restaurant - North by Northwest. We come to Austin to visit our son and are very pleased with the amenities that this hotel has to offer... More,1
"I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More",0

"Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable.",1
"I have booked this hotel for employees on several trips for an installation project in town. I have gotten several great reports from each trip by employees. The staff and manager are always kind, courteous, and on top of things. Rooms are always clean and inviting. The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, beach, businesses, and shopping.",1
"Good: The staff at the place is extremely friendly.Paradise Restaurant buffet good selection, good food, and reasonable cost.",1
My girlfriends and I celebrated there BIRTHDAY and Recovery in Bmore. It was our first time in the hotel. The staff was excellent especially the Manager(Rozellen) She very helpful in given us the best restaurant and clubs to go to..Only bad thing I didn't like was paying too much for valet parking it was very costly... But overall it was close to the harbor the other end by Fells Street which was great small local shops and bars. If you looking for different view of Baltimore this hotel is where u need to be.. We shall be back in June,1
The members at desk were very nice but if your a clean freak then i wouldnt recommend staying here. maybe if all you plan on doing is getting some rest because the shower and floor isnt in great condition. I also had a brown stain on one of my pillows. sheets are a bit out dated.,0
"Good: Staff and service was very friendly and helpfull. Hotel is nice, location is nice.",1
"This year I went myself, over a blustery weekend in late June. In the past, we had stayed here many times. Outstanding view. Rooms are always in tip-top shape the same for all common spaces and grounds. Friendly, accommodating staff. A wonderful breakfast room, as well. You can count on the Atlantis.",1
Not great - Construction is important but changing the lobby is not the most important reason. Rooms are more important. I would skip this Hotel until the construction is finished. I was not impressed to stay here.,0
"Although check-in was a bit long (new girl at desk by herself on a Saturday afternoon), the room was clean, comfortable and had nice amenities. After riding 500 miles on the Harley, the pillows were wonderfully squishy and the bed was quite comfortable. The pool was closed for the season (9/19). Not many places in the area that deliver, but... More",1

Great location. Excellent service. Delicious breakfast. Extremely accomodating for late checkout.,1
"We visited Uno's this past winter. The atmosphere is great, the servers were cutious and very nice people, and the pizza was killer. The manager came out and asked us how we were, this is always a good sign of a well ran restaurant. The waitress took very good care of us, and yes at the time there was not alot of business due to snowfall that day, she did stop to have a conversation with us. The food was excellant, very well garnished and flaverfull, and I can not remember having deep ...view moredish pizza that great! Uno's is one of the best restaurants Peoria, Il has to offer.view less",1
"We had a wonderful weekend at the Blue Sands Motel! Not only did they welcome our two standard poodles with open arms, but they were flexible with our late arrival and did everything possible to make our stay amazing. We loved the room (Room 5), which was well-appointed and quiet. The bed--a California King--was top notch. My wife said she... More",1
Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes.,1
"Well, I had to stay for two months and was a great experience. The room was well cleaned and you feel it's home coz' the design of the condo makes you feel so. The front desk staff was awesome and trust me you will have a wonderful experience with all of them. This hotel is definitely worth the price.",1
Bad: Cleanliness of entire place Asked for room with view of harbor and got other side. Not many people there so not sure why. Parking securities. Good: Location People were very pleasant and helpful.,0
Beautiful modern room with water view. Close to new Dinosaur BBQ resteraunt. Staff was great as was free breakfast. Shower was luke warm and parking and on site food/ bar was a little pricey.,1
"Nice newer hotel. Very clean and staff are friendly. Plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. Even an indoor go-cart track and miniature golf for the kids/grandkids. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel to friends and family, if in the Indianapolis area.",1
"Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!",1
We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!,1
"Very nice play to stay, clean room, nice pool area, friendly staff, nice location. Everything about this hotel met my expectations, including the price. After a nightmare stay at a motel in New Richmond, Wisconsin, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",1
"My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick.",1
"This was our first trip to Savannah and only had 2 days to explore the city. On our arrival, Christopher, at the front desk was super helpful. I mentioned our son would be arriving separately and where could he park ( cheaply). While checking in my son called me and had arrived, Christopher came outside and helped him find a... More",1
Shuttle drivers to and from FLL airport are dependable and professional. Very convenient and does not take long. Quoted reservation amount was less than actual charge and card was charged 3 times. Take with you breakfast was nice feature for early flight. McDonalds next door and shopping center a short walk.,1
"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.",0
"We stayed 4 nights and for the price it met far behine my expectation. Every thing is there for you right in this hotel. I love this hotel and I will be booking there again on my next trip to Las Vegas. They rooms are big and very clean. This hotel is great for a family trip,so much to see and do.",1
The room was really tiny but clean and there was no elevator to second floor. That was very inconvenient for us as we had a lot of luggage. And the unkind front desk lady was not helpful at all. Too pricey for what you get.,1
Stayed here many times. Watch bill for automatic safe charge. Will remove if asked to as long as you didn't use it. Don't understand two tax charges. Probably will be here for a couple weeks in Feb. 2016.,1
"The ad says that the rooms have been redone and the pictures look great, but in reality we had a poorly patched hole in the bathroom door, rusty tub fixtures, and the obviously new paint was chipping. Comforters looked new, but the sheets were super scratchy. Also, it is a motel style place (which was not clear from the ad), which means people smoke off the balcony outside their room and the air conditioner sucks the gross smoky smell into your room. It was fine for last minute since literally nothing else was available last minute for the night were were staying for business in DC, but normally for an extra 20 bucks you could find something MUCH nicer.",1
I like this place. It's in a great location and it's a nice place. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is professional and courteous. I've stayed here before and will again.,1
This establishment took over from the aging but historic Hotel Bellotti. They have remodeled and opened the place up so that you now can see main street and watch the sights and sounds while dining if you wish. They have a balcony as well that is sometime open for service. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was... More,1
"This was a nice stop for the first night of our vacation. The hotel is easy to get to off I-77 and we found the hotel to be very clean.

The service was actually very good and the staff really friendly and helpful. We stayed here for the 70.3 Triathlon. Breakfast for athletes was provided early race day and they did everything they could to accommodate athletes. The check in and check out was smooth.

We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults. We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa. It took two trips to the desk to get what we needed. Then we discovered that the sleeper sofa was hard as concrete. Folded it... More,0
"I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked. The hotel was clean and up-to-date. Very pleasant. The breakfast bar was the best one we encountered on the entire trip. In fact, I can say of the five motels/hotels we stayed in on our trip -- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- this one was the best.",1

Sorry..guess you get what you pay for...but a: NO hangers in room b. 1 chair (2 adults) c. No continental breakfast d. No pool It was 100 degrees when we checked in...at least the air-cond worked. Internet pass word was long enough to be aq security code for an IBM missile..,0
We made our reservation in advance. When we arrived the lobby was very cluttered and dirty . We checked in and paid cash for our rooms. When we entered our room it had a very bad odor. I pulled the bedspread and sheets back and there appeared to be some type of small bugs. The sheets and bedspread either were... More,0
"I like the renovated hotel for its small size and location to Old Town. Being a renovated hotel, each room had radiator heat and a standing air conditioning unit both of which can be very loud, but provide some white noise so you dont hear the train whistle.

Very nice! Accesability of bathroom was well thought out. As a handicapped person I can ALWAYS tell when the design of a space was done by a non handicapped person.,1
"The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful. I would stay here again as the location is wonderful, the price is reasonable and room adequate. I don't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem.",1
"We spent two nights in this little motel. As the name indicates it is a vintage inn and decorated in old western style.

We travel with a Service... More",1
Nice place for the price. Great staff,1
Very cool place to stay. Great location. The breakfast in picnic baskets was a great touch. Lots to do! Bikes provided for getting around the area. Rooftop bar and nightly wine tastings. Nice rooftop pool. The employees were super friendly. We will be back.,1

"The rooms were clean, neat, and its surpisingly quiet.( Because its located just near the Interstate)..Not a good selection of Breakfast though.....",1
Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff,1
This was a nice hotel. They had a small pool but a decent size hot tube. Just a large shower no bathtubs which I prefer it the kids aren't with us. Rate was pretty good. 99 a night for king bed. It had the sink out side the bathroom which I like so the mirror isn't fogged up when you... More,1

"Have stayed there several times and now that they have completed the renovations, it is very nice, felt like we were in a new hotel.

More than anything, free Wi-Fi is always a... More",1
"This is the motel that began my boycott of all Motel 6's. Two obviously drunk people asked me for a ride and I said no, so they got belligerent. I made my way to the office to report them and they followed me. They waited for me for over half an hour outside the office, yelling profanities and threatening to... More",0

On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website.",0
Bad: I didn't like that someone got stabbed in front of the W hotel on Saturday night. Made me feel really safe! Apparently that's happened before. Good: The atmosphere and cleanliness were great.,1
Enjoyed the stay. Friendly service. Shuttle convenient.,1

"Es un buen hotel. Ubicado muy cerca del metro y con servicio de transporte a la estacion gratis cada 30 minutos. El personal muy amable, en especial DANNY Y SAN, quienes son la salvacion de los que solo hablamos espanol. Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios",1
The motel is close to highway I-405 and very close to LAX airport. The surrounding can be very noisy. We stayed one night in the motel because we had an early flight from LAX. It's good for just one night.,1

Needs updating. No microwave or fridge like shown in the photos.,0
"This hotel is very nice for Everett, looks new. The breakfast is amazing. However, the employees are not helpful to guests.

Everything was good Our housekeeper did a super job. We were there for 3 days and it was super clean. Left a note saying so for her.,1

Even at the beginning, Wendy told us plenty of room available.",0

"We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience.",1
"had some minor problems, but all corrected, and had a comfortable stay.",1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Best Western Plus at Raton. It came highly recommended by a friend and justly so! Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and very convenient. We didn't get a chance to sample the indoor heated pool but it looked tempting. The beds were so comfortable. We had an amazing meal... More,1
Only thing I didn't like was they didn't take dirty cups until my second day. And I had to ask for clean cups and coffee.,1
"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit.",1
The hotel and the staff were wonderful,1
My wife and I stayed at this hotel as a staycation. The service was great starting with the valet. We had requested for a high floor and a West facing room to be able to watch the sunset from the room and our request was honored. We stayed on the 20th floor and the views were amazing. The floor to... More,1
"This hotel is definitely worth the price. Large nicely decorated room, large bathroom with walk-in shower, lots of nice touches to make you feel pampered. The beds are awesomely comfy pillowtops with 2 fluffy down comforters per bed. Location was about a ten minute walk from the space needle. Offstreet secure covered parking. We will definitely stay here next time... More",1
"The staff is very personable and helpful. The room was very comfortable. I'm not a big breakfast person, but liked that there was a variety of items to select from. There's a grocery store close (and you don't have to get on a main roadway) to grab items for your frig. Will definitely stay at this hotel again!",1
The service was the best by far friendly speedy made us feel at home,1
"Good: Location to Camden Yards, Inner Harbor and light rail stop.",1
I travel weekly with my career and I generally stay with the Hilton family - most often Hampton. The Hampton in Richmond is a very decent hotel and the staff is courteous. I recommend this hotel and I stay here several times a year.,1
"I stayed her two different times this week.both stays were perfect. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. The staff is excellent, friendly and accommodating. From check in to the housekeeping staff all were wonderful. We utilized the free shuttle service and our driver gave us local directions and tips. Highly recommend.",1
"Not the best hotel but it was clean enough and comfortable enough. Not sure what to expect when we arrived and had to pass by someone in the parking lot entrance asking why we wanted to get through, but it was okay. Average is the best word. Won't choose this place again but not bad.",1
"The hotel is at the Canal end of Lewers Street. It's not a far walk to the Royal Hawaiian Shopping centre and Waikiki Beach. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and always willing to share their local knowledge about good places to dine. Breakfast is provided in the mornings, including DIY waffles. As far as the room goes,... More",1
The room had a Mildew smell and was not very clean but had fresh sheets. Breakfast was a little skeptical so grabbed a coffee and ran,1
after reservation the clerk refused to check my workers because they did not had a credit card at the time and refused to get my info the person that book the hotel for the requirement credit hold.,0
Our family spent 4 nights at the hotel while we toured Washington DC. It was an easy walk to the Metro each day and the hotel was clean.,1
"I BOOKED THE HOTEL THRU HOTELS.COM. I ASKED FOR A ROOM WITH A BALCONY BUT NOT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE MANAGER CALLED THE ROOM AND SAID THEY WOULD CHANGE US TO A 2ND FLOOR ROOM THE NEXT DAY. I ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE IN TOWN FOR A FUNERAL, SO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE IN AND OUT OF ROOMS. WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER. MY HUSBAND JUST PUSHED IT OPEN AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, THE DOOR WAS JUST LEFT OPEN. NOT VERY RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR PART. I HAD SOME JEWELRY AND A LAPTOP IN THE ROOM.",1
Bad: smokey air out of elevators. Good: valet parking with security-,1
"The hotel was nice and the price was good also. You should know it's right beside the train tracks and the train comes by regularly, so keep that in mind especially if you're a light sleeper. They also close the laundry room at 10 pm which isn't posted, I found that very inconvenient. What if you use the pool late... More",1
"Went here with the family in June of 2011. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches in the rooms: AC, ceiling fans, glass accordion doors that open to the lanai, full kitchen and washer/dryer. The kids enjoyed swimming in many pools and the great snorkeling on the beach. We chose a mountain view room to save on costs... More",1
The Honua Kai is the newest resort in the Ka'anapali area. The place was nice and clean and very comfortable. We've stayed in several resorts in the Ka'anapali area and the Honua Kai is a very nice resort and well located with quick easy access from the main road and closeness to the beach. The beach area is nice and... More,1
Convenient location. One exit away from many restaurants. The staff was very attentive to address any issues. The lobby and breakfast area was very nice and inviting. Beds were extremely cosy and there are rooms that connect for big families.,1
"the room is very nice. It's very modern and a bit on the side of a luxurious room. there's a Keurig Coffee machine. The room is relatively small, but I would say this is norm for downtown Chicago. I'm paying maybe 170/night before taxes and fees.",1
"This is a pleasant family hotel. Although the weather was warm, the pool was closed, which was annoying. It's next to fast food places. It's right on the highway so it's a little noisy outside but the rooms are OK. You can see the lake across the highway but the rooms do not have lake views.",1
Perfect location for employee during job.,1
Could not get good internet access in the room. My granddaughter sat in the hallway on the first floor for good access. There were a lot of loud patrons slamming doors well after midnight.,1
"The staff, location , room, enjoyed our stay .",1
"This is a nice location, close to good local food and excellent snorkeling with nice beaches close by. The host is kind and prepares a nice breakfast. The room is in a tin roof shed with screened openings. The farm doesn't appear to have had any work done in the last ten years but despite that the mature trees have... More",0
"Very cute and extremely clean motel. I rented a single and it was decently sized with a TV w/cable. Shower stall in my room, 133, was a bit small but great water pressure. Convenient location to the artsy things in South Congress but also an easy 1+ mile walk to 6th St. It was quiet. Full-sized bed was very comfy.... More",1
"Really appreciate the quality, care and kindness of the Days Inn in Oklahoma City/Moore. We were traveling pretty late in the evening - booked the room on an app called Hotel Tonight, but the hotel staff gave us a better price and room upgrade than what was on the app. I would highly recommend this hotel - it was very... More",1
The room was extremely outdated and had a musty odor. The parking was not the best.,0
"Motel is in a nice and quiet location on the edge of town convenient to several eating establishments. We walked most everywhere. This is an old motel that the owners clearly are doing a great job at upgrading and keeping well maintained. Bathrooms are large and clean with good water pressure and hot water, mattresses were comfortable, room was spacious.... More",1
"The front staff as awesome and accommodating, the room they put my family in was perfect. I would definitely recommend to friends and family and return. Very close to everything. They also have bbq grills where you can bring your own food and use. Great time.",1
Good: Bed was awesome,1
"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours.",1
"We were looking for a quick low key weekend escape to get out of the heat, without breaking the bank, Upon arrival, staff was friendly, check in was a breeze, the hotel and grounds were excellent. Location was close to dining, shopping and nightlife. Will definitely return!",1
"The price was good for this stay, only stayed one night, little scary neighborhood.",1
"Great location though the property needs work. Staff incredibly kind and helpful,especially Curt in the evenings.",1
"Very good location, close to metro and a supermarket. Lots of restaurants surrounding. Free breakfast has plenty of hot foods. Free wifi is quite slow. Overall the hotel is good, price also good. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.",1
"Good: It was a great holiday, staff were very helpful. Comfortable rooms and breakfast on the floor was a great idea.",1
"The staff was very friendly and nice, the bed was comfortable, but there were ants on the walls, in the bathroom - we kept our suitcases zipped to make sure we didn't take any with us! Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved.",0
"Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower.",1
"The service was amazing! From the check-in to check-out, and everything in between, we were pampered and given the best service possible. When you check-in you have the option to order tea/coffee and newspaper delivery to your room each morning. This option arrives early each morning and is an amazing service from this hotel. Room service was delicious and the... More",1
"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location.",1
This was the fifth time that we've stayed at this BB and it was just as charming as the first. Connie and Gary are such gracious hosts! There is always plenty to eat at breakfast (someone at our table had three servings of Connie's pumpkin pancakes--and it wasn't me!) and I just love the afternoon treats that are prepared from...

"When we arrived, our 2-queen room had not been prepared. The staff gave us 2 1-king rooms for the first night, then moved us to a 2-queen room for the second night. They were very helpful in scheduling our move and handling our bags. Well done!Hi 429,Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!!!! Sorry we didn't have the two bed room available upon your arrival, that sometimes happens in our biz. Glad we were able to overcome and create a great experience for you. Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan",1
"I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.",1
"We really only needed rooms to sleep in, as we were in the area visiting family friends. 2 rooms were booked online by different parties at different times on same night. The young lady who checked us in (around 10 PM, 8-14-15) was great. She put us side-by-side facing the courtyard, which was very nice for visiting with each... More",1
"Celebrated our 32nd anniversary . Beautiful views,huge pool and jacuzzi . Great staff. May return for our 33rd",1
This hotel is a bit of a ride on the metro if you are going to DC but the facilities and staff are excellent. Great place for families with kids and an amazing breakfast. The shuttle to or from the metro is free and we only had to wait once for pick up - normally very prompt except for one 30 minute wait. Would highly recommend this hotel.,1
"Easy access location (pretty easy from BWI and rental car facility too), great shopping very close, excellent complimentary breakfast, has great bed and pillows (imho). Great value for price in this area.",1
