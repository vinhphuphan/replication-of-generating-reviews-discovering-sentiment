0,"Great atmosphere for a Scottsdale Restaurant. Although, I'd choose great food over a nice setting.\nI expected more from an Iron Chef restaurant.\nService was really slow considering there were several open tables and it was pretty late in the evening. \nThe best thing was the guacamole. The salmon I order was mediocre at best and the flavors just didn't work.\nThe tortillas for the tacos were rubbery and chew. The lamb meat wasn't well seasoned and needed salt."
0,"Five...five...five dollar foot longs. This song is very catchy indeed. However the footlongs do not catch my taste buds for long.(no pun intended) Do not get me wrong the bread is fresh and so are the vegetables. The cold cuts? Hmmm not so sure. The grilled chicken pieces they use for the sandwiches, I do not trust. It looks like soy meat. I know it is only $5.00 but for the amount of money I spend on four subs I cold buy sandwich ingredients from the grocery store that will probably last me a week. Better quality too."
0,"Disappointed!!\nI been to don pedro restaurants before, but this was my first time at this location. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away.\nFive minutes later our waitress arrived not very friendly at all.\nI  order sopa de tortilla witch I usually enjoy having (even when is hot). 20 minutes later pass after a got my soup. it was served in a huge bowl, boiling hot.the taste was nasty it tasted like water with grease and dry chile.big chunks of chicken I mean DISGUSTING ...THE waitress didn't bother to ask how the foo\nd was.she took my bowl exactly how it was  served!\npoor service & flavorless food. never coming back!!"
1,"By far, the freshest fish to be found anywhere  - Toyama is a gem - and Chef Owner Mo is very accomodating, and has a great sense of humor. His hand rolls and specials are some of the best in town.\n\nFor a true live experience, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the sushi chefs are quite talkative and very knowledgeable about their trade.\n\nRecommended specials: Toyama roll, orange cup tuna, seasoned squid salad.\n\nService: best at the bar - dining room staff is attentie, yet inconsistent and more often than not - just plain aloof! If you want to sit in fron of Mo at the bar, just make sure you arrive there plenty early."
0,"Im not impressed with their lack of a dedicated customer service rep. The lady that tried to answer the phone several times sounded like she was on a treadmill, and guessing at pricing."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality and value here. I got a $5.95 lunch special, which included a pizza slice, soda, and a nice-size salad. The pizza had a thin, crispy crust and was something called a red, white, and green--mozzarella, tomatoes, and spinach. Only complaint is the place is really small so table space is limited."
0,"Place was filled with employees but not many tables, the. Employees just standing around, not really attending the customers."
1,"I can't say enough great things about this place.  One of the best experiences I've ever had in any coffee shop across America.  The shop is very nicely decorated, and honestly the best cup of iced coffee I ever had.  I didn't even need no cream or sugar which is something I've never been able to go without in coffee.  The best of all the owner is a very sincere friendly woman who kept great conversation and made my  day just by simply being such a nice person.  If ever in the area please go and support this one of a kind small business."
0,"I absolutely HATE that I can say this... but, I remember the days when Mill Avenue had a different feel to it. There used to be fewer chains and the vibe was much more bohemian, making it more or less the only part of the Valley with any personality. Several years later, visitors to Mill Avenue really just go to a simulacrum; a soulless husk of an Old West-ish main drag. Don't be fooled by the \""historical buildings\"" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS. Its proximity to ASU is likely to keep it a popular destination, as is Downtown Phoenix' laziness and willingness to let Tempe take prominent events (i.e. Oktoberfest, New Year's Eve,) but all in all it's worth avoiding."
1,"THE BEST EVER...I have had good and bad experiences with dentists in the past. I must say that Modern Dental Care gave me the best experience ever. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. Prompt service, with friendly guidance. Dr. Mark Edington does terrific work. I felt very welcome and comfortable at every visit. I recommend Modern Dental Care for anyone with any oral emergency, tooth ache, regular maintenance or just a cleaning. You will be glad you chose them!\n\n\nThanks!\nDave"
0,"I was quite excited at the prospect of going to Bantu. I've recently been learning about African culture and cuisine and was looking forward to tasting it.\n\nI can't say I'm happy with the results.\n\nThe location is decent; close enough to downtown to be convenient. Parking is plentiful.\n\nThe decor is not what I would call African. More an amalgam of all previous incarnations of restaurants at this location; Mediterranean, Italian, French.\n\nThe dining room is quite small. There are a few tables for four and one large raised table that seats approx. 10. The patio is quite spacious, but there is a considerable amount of traffic noise from 7th Avenue.\n\nThe waitress started me off with fried plantains and a spicy sauce for dipping.\n\nThe plantains tasted and felt like what I'd imagine a banana flavored potato chip would taste and feel like. Not at all unpleasant, and I ate several.\n\nThe sauce, while spicy, was more reminiscent of Latin America than Africa.\n\nStill, it was a nice complement to the plantains.\n\nI ordered coconut stew with chicken, and rice. It was quite tasty, but mildly unpleasant in that the chicken was almost as much bone as meat. Other diners I was with shared that complaint.\n\nThe rice was good; fluffy, properly cooked.\n\nI was quite disappointed when I ordered what the waitress said was an African beer only to learn that it was in fact a Vietnamese beer.\n\nAll in all the experience was enjoyable, but the food was hardly enough to draw me back."
1,Food was great. Service lacking. Sat at sushi bar. Sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish. I would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service
1,"Four stars for service and three stars for the food. I was in need of a very quick bite to eat Friday on my way to catch a movie. I always drive by Hotel Charlotte yet I never stop - well tonight was the night. \n\nMy friend and I were greeted promptly at the door and we asked to grab a few seats at the bar since we were in a rush...no problem. The bartender was sweet and chatty and recommend a few menu items that could be made quickly....for an appetizer pimento cheese fritters after all how could you go wrong with fried cheese. Here is an interesting tidbit they use cream cheese to make their pimento cheese here for those of you who don't know its traditionally a mix of mayo, shredded cheese, and pimentos. Well to be honest they were a bit disappointing I was waiting for that crisp fried shell and hot gooey cheese - these were just luke warm the tomato sauce on the side was boring and didn't compliment the cheese at all....next up a huge bowl of Gumbo and I mean huge - I really liked the Gumbo my friend and I shared the bowl believe me its enough to share...I thought it was spicy and delicious. \n\nIf your in need of a quick meal I would definitely recommend Hotel Charlotte they also had a great selection of beers."
1,"So it seem as though management is fixing some of the issues here.  While I don't think this Super Sport is \""Super,\"" I do see the effort that's been put in to keeping this gym nice.  I would give it a 5 star rating except for one thing: The cleaning crew needs to dust the old towel cubbies.  I don't think they've been cleaned since the club moved all the towels to the front desk."
0,"Come to the area for business on a regular basis and find myself trying as many different restaurants as possible.  Took a group here (mid-week...not particularly busy) and was disappointed all the way around.  It's one thing if the food isn't as good as you would hope or expect but when the service is lacking for no apparent reason, it leaves a doubly bad taste in your mouth.  I'm a proponent of the \""fool me twice, shame on me\"" school but not sure about The Grind."
0,I would much rather give this place zero stars. I scheduled a pick up and they sent me a window when they would be there and no one showed up. However I got a call saying he's running. A few Minutes behind I can understand. Here I am not calling customer service talked to 3 diff people aside from the guy Jason who called me the last guy then told me that the driver just went back to the warehouse then left and the best the could schedule me for was 2 weeks from now. Annoying. Never going to them again now that I sat at an empty apartment and wasted 7 hours of my day waiting for them.
1,"The location is nice and the food is delicious! I got the market fish, which was very good. The meat was so tender. Other yummy dishes were duck and pork."
0,"I spent some time at Encore on opening night. \n\nCASINO: It's just like the Wynn, but with a slightly altered color scheme. \nToo much red; I felt like I was walking around in a maraschino cherry.\nThe ceilings are too low making it seem claustrophobic.\n\nRESTAURANTS: The Cirque-y moving-walls at Switch will underwhelm you every 25 minutes.\nDidn't get in to Sinatra's cuz there was a private party. \nDidn't get to Botero Steakhouse but it looks very appealing. Art helps with protein-digestion as far as I'm concerned. \nThere is no buffet: halleleujah!\n\nXS was the one bright spot...a gorgeous venue! I predict this club will become the hottest destination in the club universe. \nUntil,of course, the next over-the-top, Rome-is-burning club opens.\n\nDidn't see the rooms yet. \nI heard the Spa is extraordinary.\n\nThe best thing about Encore is the same as the best thing about Wynn: the employees. They are the best-trained casino-workers anywhere. Frankly, it's worth going there just for them."
0,"The way they run this burger king is so inefficient with the cafeteria line style of getting your food. With having to carry your bags with you everywhere, it made it very difficult. Can ya'll just do it the normal way?"
1,I no longer go to Buy Buy Baby or Babies R Us now that I've been here.  They have all of the good stuff I like to use and a really wide variety of unique items that I can't finf anywhere else. The customer service is usually pretty good.
0,I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best.
1,"i don't really like buffets.  but my family LOVES them.  so i have seen a buffet or two in my decades here on earth.\n\non a recent trip to vegas we hit up this buffet for the champagne brunch and all i can say is DAMN!  if every buffet could be like this one i would be a convert.  it was super, duper yummy.  the selection was huge, the food was fresh, and the service very good."
0,"This place has great sushi in a nice atmosphere. Very busy full of people and is open late at night. Their service has never been that great but the past few times I've been. There have been big problems with service and the last time I was totally ignored. It sucks because I like going to this place by my house. But like I said, I'm not going there again to let them treat me like I'm not an important customer."
0,"If you're in the mood for a hot dog or sausage sandwich, you'll like JJ's. But, if you go there hoping for something more, prepare to be disappointed. Their chili is good on a dog, but not great on its own. Balsamic salad dressing was very blah. Both the Italian sausage and Andouille sandwiches are good. Their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind."
1,"Went in a group of friends trying to find a non-mournful strip place that was full of life.  This was it!  Double-powered drinks for $12 and really hot ladies that didn't have bullet scars or terrible tattoos.  I had a real clingy lady sit down on me in the middle of talking with my friends, a real rude one.  But that was the outlier in the crowd of amazing women.  Good times.  \n\nWas amused by the idea of the steakhouse.  Who eats classy at a strip joint?"
0,"Freezer burnt, mediocre at best ice cream. Won't be back."
1,Maryanne was amazing at labcorp !! I let her know that im deathly afraid of needles and that I pass out when my blood is getting drawn so she put me at ease quickly. She recommended to lay down and it will be quick and painless which was all true! ! Thank you maryanne
1,The food is absolutely amazing. Had a cubana sandwich and fries with a coke was one of the best lunches i have ever had!!! The waitresses were very nice too!
0,"This company does not return calls and does not pick up the dumpster when you order it picked up!  My client called the company to have a dumpster delivered and requested a pick up 3 days later, it was confirmed and yet never picked up.  As their agent who's attempting to get the property on the market I called on my clients behalf 3 times in one day requesting a call back, giving the property address, my phone number and the day (three days prior) when it was supposed to be picked up.\n\nThey never called me back.  They never called my client and looks like I'll be driving out there again tomorrow to see if they did their job.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable company to deliver a dumpster and pick it up- DO NOT CALL Team Clean and Haul- they do not deliver what they say.\n\nT"
1,"I went there again today and this time had the Sin City smashburger..... It was just as good as the Spicy Baja burger, the Sin City had bacon, an egg, lettuce, cheese, and crispy onions. It makes me want to go try another item off the menu soon."
0,"Visited Casa Reyna in the basement of their strip district location off 21st and Penn avenue for lunch on Good Friday.  Their ambiance downstairs is decidedly cool and feels appropriate given the genre of food.\n\nMy co-worker and I opted for the special of the day: verde chicken enchiladas.\n\nThe chips and salsa were good.  The enchiladas were OK, but nothing special.  The chicken was tender, but it was just overly boring and nothing to make me say, \""Wow!\""\n\nWhat deserves special mention is the horrible service.  We were seated quickly, and then sat awhile waiting for our server.  He eventually made his way over, and after repeating our order a couple of times (due to language difficulties), we waited for our food.\n\nA decent amount of time had elapsed, but our chips and salsa were nowhere to be found.  Our chips showed up, and then thirty seconds later our lunches showed up.  I would have rather had the chips instantly while we were waiting for our food.\n\nAfter the food was delivered, no one checked on us for an extended period of time.  Since we needed to get back to work, we flagged down the manager (our server was too busy setting up tables to cater to the ones he already had), and asked for our check.  Instead of the manager getting our check himself, he tells our already in-attentive server to get it.  We never interacted with the server after the initial placing of the order.\n\nMore time elapses.....\n\nNow we are getting mad, because we've waited about 20 minutes after asking for our check, and the dirty dishes are still sitting in front of us.\n\nIt wasn't until we stood up, put our jackets on told the manager that we were leaving did he finally bring the check.\n\ntl;dr: Food was ok, service was horribly slow and inattentive for lunch."
0,The only reason I keep going back here is because my kid is addicted to the smoothies.  The kitchen is not very clean and just looks gross. All of the food is microwaved pretty much so it isn't that good.  But it is a pretty cheap reward for my kids after her therapy on Friday's so that's ok. They do have a lot of specials on food and smoothies which is nice.
1,"Once again I was not disappointed in food or service. I have taken friends & clients there of late, The friendly atmosphere is so welcoming, makes you feel like the staff is truly happy to have you there.\n\nThe two bartenders make you feel comfortable even walking in alone as a female. You are there to gap a refreshing drink, a meal or snack , some conversation & they will customize a cocktail for you!"
1,"If you are near downtown Las Vegas (or have a car to drive there) you must try these donuts.  The Lemon is filled with the same tart lemon as a lemon bar.  The Peach is filled with peach cream and topped with crumble.  Can't wait to try the chocolate.  Take these to friends, family or co-workers.  One note - the entrance is on Carson not Sixth."
0,"I went in here and was slightly disappointed.  I was so looking forward to eating Peruvian food too!\n\nSo as soon as my husband and I walk in, I noticed the hostess just looked at us.  She didn't really greet us at all.  My husband and I just stood awkwardly for a minute and I just tried to look interested in the desserts on display.  That did give me time to give googly eyes to the tres leches in the \""I will have my way with you\"" look.  So at least the awkward waiting wasn't for nothing.  I did have to look at the hostess and finally ask if it was alright to sit in the booth that was close to us, to which she did promptly bring us menus.  To me, at least give me a smile when I walk into your restaurant and acknowledge me.  That'd be nice.\n\nThe place was decorated nicely, though it was a little cold in there, but I was also sitting in the booth closest to the doors.  The environment isn't something fancy, but it is an alright place for a chill meal.\n\nThe food was a little disappointing compared to the location in Pineville.  I had ordered the chicken salad avocado and it was really salty.  I was trying to make sure I always had a bit of avocado with the chicken since it was very very salty.  I had also ordered the meat platter that provided a big variety.  It was a big portion, so that was very good.  I think that it could even be shared between four people and you'd still be full.  There wasn't very anything exciting to me about that meat platter.\n\nThe service was alright.  The hostess kind of started the night off badly for me in my opinion.  I noticed that nobody ever came to check on us.  I know the restaurant is small, but people can still stop by our table just to see how everything is.  We had to eye a waitress down and request a box after we stopped touching our food after 5-7 minutes.  \n\nI think the only good thing about this place was the tres leches.  I definitely was not disappointed with that.  If I ever find myself at this location again, I think the only thing that I would expect to be super delicious is the tres leches.  *sigh*"
0,"This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area."
1,"This place is great! It is a little on the pricey side for the evening admission (the day time is without monsters and just a walk through) there is a guy out front that hands out a $5 discount, so it's manageable. I asked if there was anything we could do for additional discount because it was my friend's 30th birthday. They couldn't do an additional discount, but they gave us a few 2-for-1 drink discounts. The place was a lot of fun too, it's a decent walk through, with a lot of attention to detail. The actors are really fun and really get into their characters. They're not afraid to be rude to you and fully get into things. A lot of places that do stuff like this hold back, but this one was really a lot of fun. I know some people say it's not worth the price, but if this is the sort of thing you are into you'll appreciate the acting and the details and it IS in fact worth it. Also, the people running it are SUPER nice and awesome. My friend and I both bought a picture at the end and they printer was having issues, so we only got the first picture out and they were working on the printer. It was closing and I felt bad, so I asked if I could just pay the difference and get a hat. They just let me have the hat, mind you, the second picture is only $5 extra and a hat is like $20. So my friend and I leave and we're like 8 stores down the line as they come running out to us because they got the printer working and gave us our picture. So we got a hat for free and they RAN out and found us to give us the picture. I've never had service that nice ANYWHERE. I totally recommend this place, for the scares, the atmosphere, and the AWESOME people!"
0,"worst return policy in the world!\neven with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!\n\nExperience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well.\nI printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??\n\nExperience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM??\nOh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day."
0,"Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened. The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business. This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber. I don't plan on going back there again."
0,"So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk."
1,"Being from the East Coast, I was looking for \""hole in the wall\"" restaurants out here in Arizona.  Scottsdale doesn't have too many mom and pop shops so I had to drive around the areas that are more profound of mom&pop shops.\n\nI drove down Southern and was about to hit up McDonalds until I saw this place right behind it.  Gyros is one of my favorite hot meals but what attracted me was the Philly Cheese Steaks they were advertising.  \n\nI went in and it felt like the restaurants I would walk in my home state.  The food smelled delicious and the prices were the average price.  They have a really good selection of food even though their advertising scheme is Cheese Steaks, Gyros, and Wings.  Customer service is a plus and they had our food out in average time.\n\nI ended up ordering a Gyro combo and my nephew ordered a Burger combo.\n\nI'm not a picky eater, so when I dug in, I ate it and thought of the gyro being a good gyro.  My nephew however doesn't really approve of hole in the wall restaurants, but after taking a bite of the burger and his fries, he actually likes the spot.  Me and him will definitely go back in the near future."
1,"I really had a good stay at this hotel. They staff was extraordinarily friendly. They offered me water upon arrival, which was very appreciated. The room was clean and spacious. I was supposed to be there for 6 days, though l left earlier than planned. On the 3rd day, they left me some milk and cookies in my room.  Very nice! the breakfast was pretty good."
1,"Found this restaurant a few years ago when I moved to this area of town. I'm glad to have found a Japanese restaurant actually owned by Japanese! Most of the Japanese places here in Vegas are run by Koreans, which I can't complain about, but I like the authenticity of REAL Japanese food like my mom makes! :) Osaka was also the first Japanese owned restaurant in Vegas!\n\nI love the late night menu. Since Osaka is open until 2am and I'm up late, it works perfect for me! The late night menu is large with great prices! Half size/priced suchi rolls, low priced apps, and great drink specials as well! \n\nSome of my favorite items are: udon, zaru soba, shabu shabu, katsudon, katsu kare, and their selection of fish! Their soups and sauces are very good and similar to how my mom makes!\n\nThe sushi chefs are very nice, friendly and Japanese. They are great at recommending menu items and love how creative they are. \n\nThey feature teppanyaki (table grilling) and tatami tables by request and live music certain days of the week."
1,WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \n\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!
1,"If there was ever a cheezy moment in my life, it was here. I was coming back on deployment from the Middle East on RR. and I wanted to renew our wedding vows that we made a couple years earlier. The staff was friendly.... We went through the drive through and did it through the window.... then got out of the car and started taking all these cheesy photos.... I think they knew exactly what we wanted.... It was awesome.."
0,"I went here for a team lunch and I was very disappointed. Dishes are very small, tapas style, and very overpriced. I went for the crispy chicken skins and they were sold out.  I got a $12 Mac and Cheese, which was too rich in flavor and so tiny. The dishes were pretty interesting and had unique ingredients in it which I can see WHY they may be more expensive but it was just not worth it. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty tiny, the seats were high and had no backing. The atmosphere just seemed really \""cool\"", but the place is all hype. It's a great place to go if you want to show off a date during dinner time and be really trendy, but otherwise I wouldn't suggest it. I left hungry and poor."
1,Visited again today.  LOVED the new musical instrument section and the expanded sheet music area.  AWESOME.
0,"I don't drink coffee so I can't speak to their particular cup of joe.  However, I've eaten their twice: Once for a sandwich and one a muffin.  The sandwich was subpar.  The muffin was pretty good.  White chocolate something-or-other.  \n\nIt's not that Charlie's has personally offended me or anything - it's just that I would prefer almost any other restaurant in existence to inhabit that spot instead of Charlie's.  If I'm forced to grab a snack in the law building, Charlie's is it.  The vending machines never take my debit card (idk why) so I'm forced to eat an overpriced, ok muffin.  It's unfortunate.  At any given restaurant I can at least find one item that's not too expensive that I like.  Not Charlie's.  It's an anomaly."
0,"The calamari is bad. Over cooked and flavorless.  The sauce didn't help it. The sushi wasn't bad but didn't separate itself from the other places nearby and it was pricey. The worst part was the service. I might have given the place another try but they brought me the wrong sushi. It looked similar to what I ordered so I started to eat it. They then brought me what I ordered. I thought no big deal no way they will charge me for it. No, they told me because I started to eat it I should pay half price at least for it. The owner argued with me about it until I gave up. I just took the money out of the tip. Way to make a first impression. I will never go there again."
1,"I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!"
1,"We moved to Phoenix about 6 months ago and since the first day I have been looking for a clean gym to work out in without having to get into a 1 or 2 year contract and have to pay a big sign up fee. About a month ago my husband found this ymca relatively close by and as a former military family they gave us a preferred membership fee without a sign up fee.\n\nSo far I'm really happy with this place. The work out area is spacious and the equipment are modern and clean. There is an outdoor pool and classes I haven't used yet, but so far I'm very satisfied with everything and enjoy my workouts a lot."
1,"Bellagio and the Wynn Hotel buffets are two of the best in Vegas.  The quality, and culinary touch is far better than the other Vegas buffets.  Bellagio's interior decor is surprisingly a bit cafeteria styled for one of the better hotels."
1,"Was in the mood for tacos last night so we visited Blanco's but they had a half-hour wait, so walked next door to J. Alexanders.  I didn't know anything about the place, but I expected over-priced blandness for some reason.\n\nIt was much better than expected.  First, I had a $5 glass of Zinfandel that was quite good.  And a generous pour.  \n\nThey had a wide range of menu choices from $10 to upper $20's.  I tried a filet mignon/mushroom/mashed potatoes dish that was very good.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp.\n\nMany reviews compare this to Houstons - while I agree that Houstons is better, we left dinner last night with $50 more in our pockets compared to my last trip to Houstons."

1,Best chicken in town love this place I eat here about twice a week definitely recommend it to all my friends =)
0,"Iv had decent and bad experiences here, but this morning I left pretty pissed. \nThis could be a corporate complaint more than the actually store complaint.\nI ordered a smoothie and oatmeal for like 7 bucks, after entering my number into the point pad It said I have 3 dollars off so I decided to use it. Then the cashier told me okay 6 bucks and some change. I asked why it said I got 3 dollars off and my price only dropped a dollar. She said \""because you got a meal, to redeem your 3 dollars off I took away the meal and charged everything full price\"". SCAM\nI own a salon and I would not say okay tank tops are 2 for 20... help someone with a 4 dollar off coupon then ring in the tank tops full price so she can receive the discount.\n\nI was really pleased by the new point system they are offering but don't be shady about it and change prices of the original order. Honestly could care less to return to a Jamba juice."
1,"Second time here- the chef and serving staff are friendly and the food is fantastic.\n\nFirst time I had the Eggs Royale which may be the best Benedict I have ever had- the salmon was perfect texture and flavor, and the hollandaise matched well with the perfectly poached egg. I had a milk chocolate tart for dessert and took a croissant to go, delicious! \n\nThis time I had a breakfast croissant with hashbrowns- incredible! I also had the lavender-vanilla green iced tea which is super tasty. Taking a salted caramel eclair to go so I can't comment on its flavor yet but I doubt I will be disappointed!"
0,"Warning go if you want to feel like cattle being moved around or suffocate from way to many people down on the pit of a dance floor.\n\nLet me start with the good. The music is without a doubt good... lot's of hip hop and dance music with great mixing so kudos to the DJ. The decor is nice and the bartenders make strong drinks. \n\nI'm from New York and there's a lot of clubs to choose from any night of the week so I notice when things aren't done right... The wait to get in the club was insanely long and I was on the VIP line! There were three lines!!! One to get through the front door. Another to give the entry pass and the last to show ID. I'm confused... am I going to the airport or a club?? Straight to the bar once inside and that took forever. I just want a drink people! The night just started. It's not even 11pm but it's chaotic before we even hit the dance floor. Finally after getting our drinks we head to the dance floor or should I call it the pit. It's sunk down in the middle of the club. It's so packed you can't move so forget trying to get to another part of the floor. It's empty outside around the dance floor but don't bother heading around there. All of security is there moving  people along like cattle. That's all security was doing in fact... forget the fact that the dance floor is dangerously over flowing with people. I even heard other people refer to being treated like cattle... you know that's bad. Sorry but don't waste my time on lines, take my money,  not even give me space to dance and herd me around like a cow. I went to Pure... beautiful, great music and spacious."
0,"Villa's, i'm not sure what the hell happened, I use to enjoy your food, it use to be clean, and you use to actually have a value. well not anymore. sadly I went in for some thrifty ice cream today. for what ever reason thrifty has the bast mint chip to me, i wanted 3 scoops, what I god was a pathetic excuse for 1 maybe 1.5 scoops if you stretched it. I don't know whats going on here but it needs to change its getting ran into the ground. not sure if its a management problem or owner problem but i'm not coming back."
1,"The new owners of this place really put their heart, soul and what sounds like a few layers of skin into fixing up the place. It's been closed for quite a while. They have cleaned, painted, cleaned, renewed and cleaned the place! It's a little loud when you have many people in there, but worth the trip. There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap...wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more! There is a separate kids menu too. They are going to serve food late too - hard to find in that area. Definitely check this place out - even just to see what work was done."
1,Tried them during restaurant week. Loved the atmosphere. Very polished. Food was fine. Server was awesome. I enjoyed the lobster risotto- it was little salty for me. My husband had the short ribs and they were meh. Nothing to write home about but we have had better elsewhere. Glad I tried it but I would probably not go again and pay full prices.
1,"Good choices, great variety. Love Mongolian BBQ. This place has a chain restaurant feeling, but they do a great job!   Recommended, especially during lunch time when the price is lower!"
1,Best mexican food in Vegas.
0,"I can only review the drinks because we had to leave. The drinks were good, although the bartenders acted like they were doing you a favor by paying attention to you.\n \nWe had to leave because it was so LOUD and CROWDED and CLAUSTROPHOBIC. Bar patrons were so packed in that they were literally rubbing their asses on the edge of our table and these two hags acted like there was a competition to see who could scream and cackle the loudest. I'm no \""fuddy-duddy\"" either! \n\nI remember my first beer..."
0,"WORST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED AT IN VEGAS!!!!\n\nFirst, housekeeping stole a $100 bill out of my wallet when they did the turn down service (i dont gamble so I know I didn't spend my $$) \n\nSecond, my key was deactivated about 15 times during my 4 night stay and the keys wouldnt even work when I would go down to the concierge and ask for a replacement so every time I wanted to get into my room I was at the mercy of security to let me into my own room. This was extremely inconveniencing at 2pm, 5pm, and 2am especially when security took their sweet time (upwards of 30 minutes) to let me into my room. \n\nTHEN, after I complained, one of the managers said I could have a $40 room credit which I planned to use on room service after I had gotten off work. I ordered a SALAD at 12am hoping it would arrive in an hour...no. Two hours later, I called to cancel my order because I was going to bed...starving. \n\nFinally after that charade happened, I left a dress in another room. I called 2 weeks later wondering if it had been turned into lost & found. Immediately the lady on the other line said it wasn't there and they only keep items for 14 days. Remind you, she hadn't asked what my checkout date was or for a description of the dress. So rude. I never wish a stay at the Aria upon anyone. Its aesthetically pleasing but the customer service is worse than Circus Circus. A bunch of selfish clowns who could care less about their consumer."
0,"No one under 21 can eat here.  We had a wedding rehearsal dinner and two of my children were under 21 but because it is associated with a casino, no one under 21 can enter the restaurant.  Crazy, as I've eaten with my family in Las Vegas and California Casinos without incident, but here they wouldn't even let us near the restaurant.  Too bad as I'm certain this must destroy their business. We spent our 800 bucks at Eddie Merlots instead.  Well worth it."
0,"Worst return policy in town!  The store manager did not even respect me, the paying customer, enough to come to the customer service desk to discuss a requested return. I tried to return a brand new dress with the tags attached and the original receipt, however, because I purchased the item more than 30 days ago they refused to issue me a credit to my Visa.  I was given a store credit.  My fiance tried to return a defective bottle of cologne this past weekend (the pump spray stopped working) and they would not exchange the defective item for a working item. We will be taking all of our business away from Ross and shopping at other discounters like Target, Anna's Linens, Tuesday Mornings, TJ Maxx, anywhere but Ross."
0,I tried this place twice because it was very different.  It is different but that's it.  The place doesn't have much else going for it.
1,I have had Indonesian food probably 8-10 times in my life (and in various cities). This was easily the best.  Outstanding... the pork belly buns were outrageous melt in your mouth. We had a noodle dish with shrimp plus a chicken red curry.  Crazy good.  Going back on the way out of town to get carryout for the long drive home from Montreal.
1,"Smokehouse beef brisket and cheddar is the absolute best sub ever!!!! This may be blasphemy, but the brisket n BBQ sauce in this sandwich rivals that of any BBQ joint I've ever been to. Yes, it's that damn good!! Go and get one... NOW!!!"
1,"My BF and I went to Black Bear for the first time yesterday based on reviews I had read. The prices seemed just a bit high but every single bit of the the food was delicious. We tried the breakfast menu, but definitely want to go back for lunch or dinner.\n\nI was in the mood to try a bit of everything, so I actually got 2 orders from the \""small\"" section. A small cinnamon roll French toast, and a small combo plate with 1 egg, 1 sausage link, 1 biscut, and hash browns. It was so good that I ate everything except half the biscuit. And that was because I was simply out of room by them.\n\nThe only slightly problemic thing was that my BF ordered a large orange juice and what he got was more like a small or regular. And he had to ask the waiter for it twice. Yes, the juice was fresh-squeezed, but for $3+ we expected more."
1,"This review is long overdue.  Blue Taj is one of my favorite restaurants in South Charlotte.  The staff is very friendly and are great guides if you are new to Indian food.  My favorite is lamb in the lentil sauce.  And, even if you are not a cauliflower fan, you have to try the cauliflower appetizer.  \n\nWhether you prefer your food on the milder side, or native hot (level 5), they can adjust almost any dish to your liking.  \n\nI"
1,"Thu/2 May about 6:45 pm had dinner here with 6 other people:\n- Service was excellent and everyone in my group enjoyed their meal.\n- We went with mostly the \""2 for $20 Menu\"" which includes 1 appetizer + 2 entrees.  For appetizer it was the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which also included some salsa and when we were low on chips we asked the server to bring us some and she hooked us up.  For entrees my seatmate (she sat next to me) had the Applebee's Riblet Basket and I had the 7 oz House Sirloin.  A couple of people had dessert (it looked to be the Oreo Shooter and a Chocolate Mousse Cake).\n- It was one friend's birthday and when I mentioned it to the server she orchestrated the whole Appleebee happy birthday thing where the staff comes out with a free dessert item for the birthday person."
0,"Whoever orders from here is crazy. I ordered two \""famous\"" cheese steaks. Both weren't started until 15 minutes after I ordered. They cool each order 1 at a time. \n\nThe sandwich was bland, there was no salt, the mushrooms were clearly from frozen and not cooked long enough. The meat count was skimpy as well. \n\nThis place claims to have been on the Food Network, but less than 6 months ago it was a catfish restaurant. \n\nBasically Gino's in Philly has absolutely nothing to worry about."
1,"Out of 7+ years with Sir Sweetie Petey, the handsome Maltese, Jennifer at Classic Canine III ranks # 1 with me! Due to a few moves, I've had 4 different groomers. \nJennifer has proved to be THEE best of the 4. Can't forget the silly sweet Maltipoo, Charley Larly Loo 3 + yrs old. She's got it down when it comes to the perfectly groomed boyz of my life. If you take pride in how your fur babies look go see Jennifer at Classic Canine III. She even caters to reducing the stress of the grooming experience. Found out if Petey can't see his best bud Charley during his grooming he barks And it's no small yip yip. He's Loud !!Jen, with canine intuition, makes sure Pete can see his buddy Charley.  When it's time to go home, I can tell they're happy little guys. I absolutely love & appreciate the effort put into making the trip to Jennifer's a happy one & am delighted to receive all the compliments on my beautiful boyz."
0,"I had the Firehouse Hero, hot roast beef, turkey and ham. It really lacked in flavor, just tasted like warm mystery meat. This is my first time eating at Firehouse and I wasn't impressed. The meat was piled up in the middle so I opened it up to spread it around and with 3 meats it barely covered the bread. Expensive for a toasted sub. Also they made my sandwich on wheat but I asked for white, not a big deal, but when I asked to have it remade they didn't even apologize. And I had to wait until they finished making the other guests sandwiches. I won't be coming back, customer service isn't there, no flavor and overpriced."
0,"Usually PF Changs is a place with great service and food, this location lacked both. I came here with my family of seven on vacation in Las Vegas. We came around noon and at time, it wasn't busy.\n\nFirst off, our server lacked the intelligence to take our order. I wasn't sure if she didn't understand what we wanted to order or if she wanted us to buy the more expensive dishes in order to get a bigger tip. Either eat, it didn't seem like she cared of providing good service.\n\nThe food was god awful. Everything was dry and had little to no flavor. The rice that came with the dishes were extremely dry. If I were blindfolded and eating their rice and bits of paper, I wouldn't have known the difference. We ordered the salmon and asked it to be cooked well. It came out with the inside still pink/slightly cooked. \n\nOverall, everything was poor. I enjoyed the restaurants decor. That's a plus."
1,"Needed a late night snack after driving all day and this place was across from our hotel.  Pizza was great, crust was cooked just the way I like it, crispy on the edges and lots of cheese and toppings.   Staff was friendly."
0,"Overall:\n\nRosemary's should bill itself as \""Fancy Style\"" because this is not an authentic \""Nice Restaurant.\""  \n\nI would never return to Rosemary's again.  The food was unimpressive, the service wasn't as good as it should have been and the atmosphere was a mockery of a fine dining establishment.  \n\nFood:  \n\nThe food was OK.  Of the eight or so things I tried I thought two were above average.  The bread they served was slathered with butter and that's always a good thing.  It was delicious, warm and a great way to start the meal.  The one thing I'd describe as memorable was the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw.  I'd order a plate of this and go home.\n\nI tried two soups and wasn't blown away by either.  My appetizers were a beef carpachio, which was fine and sweetbreads which were chewy.  \n\nMy main course was scallops, which were horribly overcooked.  My friends ordered fish which was also overcooked.  None of my friends raved about their food except for one (you'll see why under the service section).\n\nThe food aimed to be \""high end\"" but there was nothing innovative or interesting about this food. \n\nThe drink selection was good, specifically beer.  The drinks were expensive but they had a top notch beer selection.\n\nAtmosphere:  \n\nRosemary's is located in a strip-mall.  Even better, the light over the front door was flickering like one outside a cheap motel.  The artwork on the wall wasn't especially interesting or noteworthy.  There were some framed mirrors by the bar which felt like something out of Crate and Barrel.\n\nMy friends who recommended the place made it sound like it was about to receive a Michelin star but nothing could be farther from the truth.  In a city like Las Vegas, which is full of world-class restaurants, Rosemary's felt like the place in a small town were folks go for their anniversary.\n\nThere's a reason this place is three miles from where all the tourists are.\n\nService:\n\nThe service here aimed to be good but failed at the one thing that supposedly makes them unique.  When we were seated we were asked if there were any food allergies or requests.  This on one hand was very nice because we had several people with food differences.  On the other hand why not just wait until people order to ask such a sweeping question?  Also most people with food differences don't wait until they're asked to share so it seems like a nice question but it's actually quite dumb.\n\nMost servers, when presented with a table full of people with food challenges, would be sure to note any foods that were ordered which have \""hidden meats\"" like chicken stock or pork.  Two people, who do not eat ham, were served food with two kinds of bacon.  The server didn't think, \""Hey these people don't eat red meat... maybe that extends to bacon!\""  Since she had pretended to care so deeply my friends ended up eating things they didn't want to.\n\nThis place makes a big show out of being \""fancy\"" and their servers are instructed on how to act.  They put on a good show but nothing could hide the fact that our server wasn't comfortable talking to the customers and established no report with our jovial table.  \n\nValue:\n\nRosemary's used quality ingredients in their food but cooked them poorly, did nothing interesting with the food rendering it a waste.  For the $55 I spent on dinner I could have gone to a much higher quality place and had slightly less food.  I don't need to be stuffed with badly cooked scallops and bread to feel I got my money's worth."
1,"I love it! This menu was definitely pushing me out of my comfort zone, but it was really, really awesome. The flavors were complex, and the staff's menu knowledge was spot on. \n\nI got there just after 9:00 on Saturday and managed to miss the wait. By 10:00 the vibe turned into a sexy hip crowd. I just wanted to stay there all night. I also like the fact that you can see the food being prepared. \n\nI was playing it safe and had the salt & pepper shrimp appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. Lots of flavor, cooked perfectly and sort of ....well, stunning. I then felt braver and had some thing called  Lop Chong on a steamed buns (both of which were completely foreign to me) and it was mind-blowing. Because it was late I passed on the noodles but oh....next time."
0,"I wanted to try their menu for the first time at the Cabarrus County Food Truck Friday.   The event was held from 5-9pm.  I didn't get there until shortly after 8, waited in line for over an hour.  Because the line was so long they were still serving customers after 9, there were still a good 25-30 people still in line.  I am finally the second customer from the window, it's 9:15p, and they tell us they're done!  And not politely either.  She just shouted to everyone \""WE'RE DONE!\"" There were only maybe 10-12 people left in line!  So I didn't get to try anything!   I will never attempt to get anything from here again.  Lost my business before I've even tried it."
1,"My first time at a Carrabba's and it surprised me in quality and service.\n\n The dough wasn't good for the pizza, and instead of serving sub par stuff to my friend the GM came out and explained what happened and offered any other entree. It was classy and put a restaurant that can get mixed in with other mid-grade italian places that extra star. We came on Wine Wednesday and had the Sangria which was delicious."
0,"I had a hysterectomy/hernia repair done in December where the wound opened up in January.  I received a call from my physician asking me to come to Mercy Gilbert where she was on call over the weekend so that we could take a closer look at the wound.  Dr Jennifer Reitz of Advanced Surgical promised me a direct admit to the hospital --on the way there we received a call from the call center stating I would have to go through the ER.  I arrived in the ER and was taken back - before vitals or anything else was done I was informed by the RN that I was being placed on a Psych hold because I had made statements that I planned to kill myself.  I immediately went to run - they called security who came in and tackled me dragging my open wound across the floor and then used my face to clear a supply rack.  I was then thrown in a gurney and halled down the hallway and told I would have to take any clothes off that were mine and be in there clothes.  They would not even let me keep my underwear.  I never told a doctor that I wanted to kill myself - their notes specifically state that I did not say this.  This all came about based on a conversation with a home health nurse I was trying to fire because she was not tending to my pain and Dr Jennifer Reitz who then turned around and put words into my husband's mouth to justify this.  I was told that I would be held at the hospital overnight and could not leave AMA - the only other option was going to jail. Eventually I was placed in a room, had all my belongings taken away and thrown into their med-surg floor where the nurse laughed all night at me,  Finally the psych douche bag shows up and agrees that what I had said 12 hours earlier was true...I was not suicidal.  However, in order to not be sent for inpatient psych eval I had to agree to work with the surgeon who lied to me and allow her to do another surgery.  I now truly fear this facility...their is no human kindness involved here.  This ER wanted someone to beat on and I was that person.  I now have severe PTSD and do not trust anyone in the medical field to touch me.  Do yourself a favor...if you have an issue that requires the ER avoid this one.  Not only did they do nothing for my wound pain -  they have left me with severe PTSD and nightmares.  The place needs to be closed and everyone that works there needs their license taken away from them without an option of ever being able to get it back."
1,"As a local who lives close to Palace Station, I go to Oyster Bar about once a month (and whenever I have out of town visitors). \n\nThe food is fantastic. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and by far the best thing on the menu is the Combo Pan Roast. I also almost always get oysters on the half shell when I visit. The oysters are always super fresh and very reasonably priced. They currently have a late night special where a half dozen is 8.99 (full dozen is 16.99 if I remember correctly).\n\nThe only negatives (and they're big ones) are the wait and the service. If you go during a peak times (weekend evenings), expect to wait about an hour in line and then another half hour to get your food after getting seated. Basically, the place is really popular and there are about 16 seats at the bar and 2 overworked chefs who often struggle to keep up with the orders. \n\nIf you go during the day and get Ricardo as your chef you're in for a treat. He's super friendly and probably the best oyster shucker I've ever seen. He definitely gets your food out faster than the other chefs."
1,"WONDERFUL!!! I can't say enough about it. What a beautiful little gem of a restaurant. I received a gift certificate from a friend for Christmas. I had never been, and was excited to go. It is a tiny little place, but they manage to seat more than you'd think could fit in the space. Such a calm, relaxing atmosphere. The food is gorgeous from start to finish...it looks gorgeous, smells gorgeous, and tastes gorgeous! I savored every bite like it was my last. I took an out of town friend there for dinner and he loved it! Exclaimed over everything and said it was the best Thai he'd had in a long time, and he lives in Atlanta. The hostess/waitress is so lovely. She answered all of my questions about the menu, recommended dishes, and even adjusted the spiciness of a dish to my liking (I craved more spice!). The soup is to die for! A glorious experience all the way around. All I can say is go, go, go!"
0,I walk in on a warm Summer Tuesday night at 11:30pm and look at the ridiculous set up of different lines for different meats and I and many others are overwhelmed.  It takes an hour to finally get to the counter and get my food. The tacos de adobada (al pastor) are nothing to write home about and much less spend an hour in line for. They were OK. If you think these tacos are 100% authentic tacos al pastor or arabe or adobada.....whatever you want to call them. You have not tried 100% authentic street style tacos. Even L.A.'s famed King Taco blows this place out of the water. Not worth it. P.S. I saw many people ordering food and not paying for it.
0,"This place is a chain, so I'll keep this brief.  The burgers are just ok.  Nothing special and definitely don't come anywhere near my Best Burgers of Phoeinx list.  \n\nI had the Royal Burger or whatever it is called.  Look, it's the one with the egg on it ok?  Anyway, the egg is way too done.  I'd prefer over easy or medium at the most, but this sucker was way over hard.  Not a fan so I 86ed the thing.  Way too much mayo on it too.  The fries are decent, mozarella sticks too.  Nothing amazing here.  I did enjoy the chocolate shake though.\n\nThe two times I have been to this location the service has been pretty poor.  Nothing I'm in the mood to get into right now, but the hostess was lame and the waitress subpar.\n\nFunny tip: when they ask if you've been to a Red Robin before.  Say no.  They all over react like it's the craziest thing that you've never been to a Red Robin before.  I don't see the big deal if you haven't and their reaction is annoying, but now that you know what they'll do it is fun to mess with them and see how they over react.\n\nWant great burgers?  See my list of Phoenix's best burgers. Try one of those places and you won't be disappointed."
0,"Avoid this location!  Seriously, drive 10 minutes out of your way to go to another location.\nWe love Oregano's and have been going to the old town and Scottsdale and Shea location for years.  Always great service and food.  But this location broke the mold in the worse way!  Our last visit we were told 35 minute wait, which is fine, so we had drinks at the bar.  40 minutes later the hostess told us our table was being cleared and she actually pointed to it.  5 minutes later another party is there, so we wait for another 20 minutes.  Finally get sat outside when we asked to be inside.  No one comes by for at least 10 minutes.  When they do we ask for the wobbly table to be fixed and our waitress tells us \""it's frowned upon\"".  And it just got worse from there, wings, salad, pizza, pasta all came out in 10 minute intervals, no utensils, drop a beer off and run off with out getting another order...  Everyone in our party of 7 talking about how poor the service was.\nIt was a birthday so I choose to bite my tongue and call a manager later.  When I do he is very understanding and apologizes.  He says he is going to mail me a gift card and a week later, no gift card so I call back to check the address only to get another manager that takes my address again and promises to get back to or mail the gift card.  A week later, no gift card."
0,"If I could give this dump zero stars I would.  The guy who owns the place acts like a jerk.  I don't know if he is incapable of love or happiness, but he wears his poor attitude all around that place.  The food takes a while, and if you want your food within a 2 hour time span, dont' get it delivery.  Then it will take a GREAT while.  When I got the food it was greasy.  I know I'm going into a hot dog joint and all, but these hot dogs were slathered in grease.  The fries were okay- nothing special.  After I got done eating I got that disgusting feeling (the kind that McDonalds can provoke) and felt lethargic.  Overall, I would recommend Chicago Beef Stand if you want food like this in Champaign."
1,"Second time coming here this week-delicious! I love the topping selection, how QUICK they cook your pizzas (I have a short lunch break), and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on. Yum!"
0,"Alright...This was my third time going back and I don't think I will be back again, as my ratings keep going down and down. \n\nThe hubs and I were near by and hungry. He had never been so I said we should stop by. \n\nWe get there, there is one other table of people eating, the place is empty and there are NINE employees working. It did not seem like there was a manager working as what transpired was out of control. \n\nTwo male employees are bickering back and forth, LOUDLY...like super loud, we could hear everything that was going on the whole time we were there. I was waiting for fists to fly at any second. You would think if there was a manager on duty, they would have split the two guys up or sent one home early. It was really very uncomfortable. The raised their voices to each other the WHOLE time we were there. \n\nNext an employee walks in with burgers and fries and hot dogs from Five Guys next door. Employees are all hanging around a table eating and talking and really having a great time. I was floored. None seemed to be on a legitimate break as they would hang around the table, eat, go do some work, then come back and talk and eat. No employee looked to be over the age of 18. \n\nWe go to bite into our sandwiches and it seems that all the distractions really made for poor sandwich making. I ordered a Vegetarian, I open it up and its missing the sprouts. Hubs orders the Vito, and asks them to put mayo on it instead of the dressing.....they opt to put nothing on it. So we both had to take our sandwiches back up and ask them to fix them. \n\nThis was the hubs first time and he never wants to go back there. It was really just not a good experience at all."
1,"$4 steak and eggs special during midnight graveyard hours. Its not on the menu but you can ask the waitress about it and they will tell you about it. NOT bad for the portion they give you, it comes with hash browns and toast as well. What a deal! I only go here for their steak and eggs specials after a long night of clubbing and partying. Inside of the Tuscany suite at Marilyn cafe."
1,Nice location. Too bad Westmount Park is just a bit too far to make it before your ice cream melts! Delicious excellent ice cream and nice place to sit and enjoy.
1,"Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed."
0,"I've eaten at a lot of fine dining establishments during my time living in Vegas, and Olives is by far the worst, and one of only two restaurants that I refuse to go back to (the other being Prime, located just up the mall from Olives).  \n\nWhere to begin? First, our party of three arrived for our 8:00pm reservation a few minutes early, and had to wait until about 8:30pm before we were seated -- strike 1.  We ventured to the bar to wait, where I decied I'd try one of their speciality cocktails they were offering for the night - except not, because they were out -- strike 2.  When we were finally seated, we were crammed into a crowded, loud, dark corner where we could barely move -- strike 3. \n\nTo expand, the atmosphere and ambiance of Olives is awful.  They have crammed way too many tables into their already cramped dining room, for no other reason than because they can, I would suppose.  The wait staff is constantly bumping into the backs of chairs and are forced to reach in front of you to accomplish even the simplest tasks.  A side effect of the crowded dining room is the noise.  Even at a small table, you can forget about conversation unless you feel like losing your voice from shouting by the end of your meal (I'm exaggerating, but this place is WAY too loud for a high-end restaurant).  The lighting is ineffective, and the tables are so dark that you can barely see what you're eating - this is not necessarily a bad thing, because the food was so overly complex, that it failed on just about every level.  Yet another restaurent that fails because of what I like to call 'Top Chef Syndrome' - leave the campy molecular gastronomy, overly complex sauces, and useless garnishes to the few professionals that do it well, and get back to the basics of just cooking your food well.\n\nEverything (with the exception of the osso buco, which was the only highlight of the meal) was just not up to par with a restaurant of this reputation and price.  Our meal for three was close to $600 - apparently we gambled, and lost, on this one.  I wouldn't go back here even if someone else was paying."
1,Awesome place!!\n\nDecor is rad feels like Im at someone house in Japan for eats. and just about everything off the menu is delish. I return often!
1,"Just had the best spinach pie in my life, so fresh and garlicky! Jb and the inlaws all had chicken tandoori and each were raving about it. I tasted the basmati rice which was light & fluffy and sooo full of flavor.  Salims catered a friends wedding last year andthere were absolutely no complaints. Salims is amazing!  Can't wait to go back!!"
0,Food was good. The service was disappointing. Your better off going to Gallo where people actually care.
0,"Went into the retail conglomerate on a Sunday afternoon to pick-up a camera my son had his eye on. When we got back to the camera section, we couldn't find the model we were looking for and there was no associate around to turn to for help. I got the attention of the young man working the cell phone counter and he said he would summon someone to help us. \n\nThe associate that came to help us seemed disgruntled by the fact we needed help and wanted to know if they had they particular model we were looking for at another location (Don't even get me started on the screws he had in his ears pretending to be earrings).  This young lad was rude, unprofessional and put off a huge \""I don't want to be here vibe.\"" You know it's bad when three teenage boys, who have nothing on their minds but skateboards and girls, notice the poor attitude and lack of customer service. He eventually did let us know another Walmart location had what we were looking for, but did so with such disdain it was alarming. I can't lay all the blame on him, as I am sure he wasn't provided with a whole lot of training on how to deal with customers. You would think with the way the economy has been, companies would put a bigger focus on training their employees how to deal with the customers.\n\nWe were so put off by the poor customer service, we stopped by the Best Buy across the street. Come to find out, their price was just as good as Walmart's. I have yet to write a one-star review, but this came really close. It's hard to stay away from Walmart, because they offer almost everything, but experiences like  this make it an easy."
1,"I've called upon Mast Air twice in the past year.  The first time was because my furnace wasn't working (55 degrees in the house!) and the second time was because my AC was emitting a sporadic burning smell.  Both times, they were extremely fast.  They are very well priced, and even offer a great yearly maintenance package that includes two visits and a discount on repairs.  Mike was very nice, pleasant, and did excellent work.  He even let my boyfriend come up and see what the problem was to visualize the situation (apparently, no one had EVER cleaned the 12 year old AC, ick!).  My air is now colder and the AC on less, after just one simple visit!  They came recommended by the lady that sold me her house, and I am so glad she gave me a referral."
0,"this kashman's is closed - as of Sunday June 20, 2010\n\nTheir summit location is still OPEN - however, this is a little farewell to the Pinnacle Peak location.\n\nWhat used to be my favourite deli turned into a nasty neighbor. It's nothing personal, but really - they did everything to drive my business away, so when I say their doors closed, I was actually relieved because they left a sour taste in my mouth. While their food was decent, it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me but everybody.\n\nI will not even bother to drive further north to visit their other location because really the farther away they are, the happier I am!"
0,"every time i have grabbed a snack at this place they have messed up my order and it tasted horrible anyhow.\n\nthey also take forever to complete your order. it does not take 20 minutes to make a quesadilla, sorry.\n\nnever going here again."
0,"I have been excited to go to this restaurant for awhile, and finally I got my wife (not a fan of BBQ) to give it a go. The experience started out great... the manager Danny seated us, commented on how he had recently won a competition for best ribs and even gestured to the award on the wall.\nWhen it came time to eat, this is where the meal went downhill. My wife's meal was wrong and she had to send it back (she ordered nachos with chicken) but at first glance my full rack of ribs was fine. As I started eating, my wife asked \""Are ribs supposed to be that pink?\"" The meat was a little pink, but i figured they just wanted them to be tender. However, as i progressed however the rack was less and less cooked, going from pink to red. I looked over at my wife's plate and she was literally picking out the PINK portions of chicken. We asked to speak to the manager and he never came back to the table.\nLong story short, if you like your chicken rare, and your ribs even more so, then sticky fingers in Ballantyne is for you. If you prefer to not roll the dice on a night hugging the porcelain... then stay away."
1,"Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free, so sweet."
0,"I see so many 4-5 star reviews for this place, but after trying so many menu items, it has to be about the burgers and my experience was particularly bland.  One of my friends and his girlfriend were raving about this place, since they came the previous month and told me that I had to come try it for myself.  We had the following:\n\n**Jalapeno Poppers: Now these are legitimately awesome, and would get them on their own.  Great taste, not to spicy and a perfect sauce.  \n\n**Fries (Truffle Parmesan/Sweet Potato/Regular): These were all delicious, as was their accompanying sauces. \n\n**Hells Kitchen Burger: So shouldn't this be the main event?  I was anxiously awaiting some crazy taste bud exploding moment of ecstasy that never came.  The meat was bland, the cheese didn't have much of a taste and I never felt like I tasted the peppers.  I did get it medium, so I was surprised that it was so devoid of flavors.  What happened to this supposedly insane burger?\n\nService wasn't good.  After we ordered, the waiter mentioned that since the burgers taken 30-45 minutes to make, we might want to think about some appetizers.  Great, thanks for letting us know.  We ordered three (3) appetizers, and they came out about 25 minutes later.  3-4 minutes after that all our burgers came out.  So much for getting appetizers to hold us over for our meal. We all had suspicions that our tab was intentionally  raised, but whatever.  \n\nSince we had players cards, we had a small discount on the food, which amounted to about $20.  He forgot to apply it, and he said he would after he ran our credit/debit cards.  He \""forgot\"" yet again, until I explained to him that he had not ran our players card discount.  He did finally corrected it, but after I spotted it twice.  My party felt like he was doing way too many things on \""purpose\"" to forget to apply the discount.  \n\nThe funny thing is that I did not want to say anything about my experience at BurGR with my friends since one of them really wanted us to go try it out.  It wasn't until we went to Fat Burger right before we were heading back home that two of my friends commented on how much better Fat Burger was than BurGR, at a fraction of the price.  And I completely agreed in not only cost but in flavor.\n\nI might try it out again, since so many people rave about it.  But I may have to share a plate in case I am disappointed again."
0,"I recommend spending the extra money at the Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace! The first time I went to this buffet 12 years ago I loved it, but we recently were staying at the Mandalay Bay for a night and wanted to just dine in the area. It costed a little over $30/adult and $20 for my 5 year old. The food selection was not as much as what I remember it to be and it just seemed over priced. The quality was good, just disappointed on the lack of selections and having to wait for certain food items. I would not go back just because there are so many other places to choose from in Vegas. I would also rather pay $50/person at the bigger resort/casinos for a better selection of food/seafood."
0,"honestly, this place sucked.  here's why.  I've NEVER left an italian restaurant hungry until I went to casa di amore.  The seating was ridiculous.  my wife and I were sitting so close to other guests, that we could've eaten off of their plates.  I had hopes in the \""homemade\"" noodles only to be let down.  Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.  Let this be a lesson to you casa di amore, stop screwing your customers."
0,"40 minute wait for hotdog and burger, others waited longer than us just for ice cream.... $10 tiny burger. Don't do it"
1,"Last week, on the way from the Airport to the Convention Center, me and my buddies decided it was time for some breakfast.   Fortunately, we came across this IHOP.   The place was pretty empty, I believe there were only two other parties there besides us.   The service was fast and friendly.   Our hostess / waitress (Shee was her name) was awesome.   The food was average for an IHOP.   You know what you will get.   As a bonus, this IHOP is close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.   \nThis is a good place for breakfast.   \nWill I be back?   Yeah, maybe."
1,"Mundo has, hands down, my favorite happy hour in Vegas. Ok well one of my top 3!\n\nPopped in with girlies yesterday for snacks and sangria. Sangria and margaritas are $4. Can't beat that!  They make a quality fresh margarita - none of that premade mix crap. There are other drinks offered at happy hour as well. There's about 15 food items to choose from ranging in price from $3 for a moist delicious sweet corn tamale to $10 for steak skewers with chimichurri. The queso flameado and calamari are a must! Chips and salsa are complimentary and Aaron and Mark will take excellent care of you. \n\nFurthermore, it's awesome inside. The chocolate brown velvet coupled with the bright turquoise accents and hanging lanterns set the scene in this hidden gem."
1,Best CheeseBurgers in the East Valley !  Service by there employees is always above and beyond !
1,"Best teriyaki chicken in town!\n\nNot sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite with fat on it. Even the side salad is great, this coming from a guy who doesn't care for many things green... \n\nThe owners are extremely caring and the food shows their attention to detail!\n\nWell done!"
1,Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\n\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \n\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training.
1,1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.
0,"There is a certain amount of novelty to being cycled around town on a pedicab.  It offers a rustic outlook to travel around town, but unfortunately it's unbelievably expensive.  When I hear how much people have paid for these pedicabs, I'm surprised that they even have that amount of money on them in the first place.\n\nPrice aside, and it's a big thing to put aside, they are in abundance in tourist spots and around clubs and for those who've had a bit too much to drink and unable to get in a real taxi might find them of use.  This only leaves the last concern which is speed and these are very slow hence why it ends up costing so much.\n\nDespite all this I do have a degree of admiration for the drivers - it's not the easiest work especially in the hilly areas."
1,"Chicken Diablo pasta was very delicious - highly recommend. Also had the bowtie chicken alfredo, which was pretty good as well. Diablo was best though!\n\nService was a little slow/not ideal. She forgot our bread and salad until we asked, just as our entrees arrived. Salad had a good dressing, but nothing special other than that. Bread was not warm, and had 1 small sized piece - too small for sharing amongst the two of us, but we skipped it since it wasn't warm. Oil for bread came in a small plastic container - would have been nicer if it had been served on a plate.\n\nThis place would definitely benefit from a few nice touches - better silverware, plate for the oil/bread, better bread, paper for table coverings put in the back (instead of behind us while we ate), improved server skills. A relaxed environment, but next time we'll probably just do take-out."
1,"I am going to knock R&K down 1/2 star from my original review.  I know I can't give a 4.5 but that's what I want to do.  While they were great, I found out that they advertise on the radio for at least one services that no one needs.  Keep in mind though that the guy who came to our house did not pitch any service with a low ROI.\n\nAs a reminder the top 3 ROI projects for saving money on energy, from several experts I talked to who wanted to be off the record, were:\n\n1.  Seal vents\n2.  Insulate\n3.  Window shading\n\n[Now, this isn't in the top 3 but if you have an electric water heater then adding a timer will save you money.  Get an electrician (shop around) and the whole thing can be done for under $200.  Who needs to spend money heating water at 2am?  Not me.  That saved us money as well.]\n\nOur electric bill went down after R&K insulated.  Good deal."
1,"Love this store!! Great place to shop for personalized gifts. \nThey have tons of delicious smelling teas, which you can smell , taste and ogle over. My friend Kris and I stop by with my mom and we were impressed. They have ice teas, fruit teas, chocolate teas, white teas anything you can dream of. \n\nI am already imagining creating gift baskets with the goodies they have here. By the way , the prices are more than reasonable and give you lots of choices to contemplate. \n\nStop in here to relax , shop or just get creative with tea! Love it!"
0,"I am honestly shocked by the amazing reviews for this restaurant. We read them and went with such high expectations of amazing food and atmosphere. Maybe it was our fault we were so let down, but we won't make the mistake of going here ever again. \n\nWe walked in to find that it was a complete dive. Flies were buzzing about and servers were standing around bored. It just seemed so dirty and unkempt. Ok... maybe the food would blow us away...\n\nWe read reviews on the fabulous fresh baked bread so we knew we had to order sandwiches. My sandwich was mostly dry, shredded iceberg with a blob of mayo, dry turkey that looked like it met its fate under a lawnmower. Thank god I paid extra for avocado and bacon.... because those were the only things I could taste at all. The bread was so BLAND and plasticky. It was just... not good. And it was beyond expensive for what we got. \n\nIf you have a palate more sophisticated than that of a 4 year old, this is not the place for you."
0,"Sons of fucking bitches. \n\nThree orders of food and when we pulled up to the drive-thru window and asked to add a taco to the order, we were told by the young man working the drive-thru window that NO, there are no \""extra\"" tacos, they are made to order. \""Yeah, we want to order one.\"" He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said \""no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand.\"" No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so? To top it off, when I called later to talk to the manager, a co-worker answered the phone giggling and then finally said \""uhhh. EHH ... HELLO?\"" \n\""Hi. Is this Jack in the Box?\""\n\""Uhhh. YEAH.\"" \nLooks like JITB needs to step it up on the employee training manual."
1,Possibly the best bacon cheeseburger I have had this decade! Nice cool Blue Moon beer on draft to wash it down.  Restaurant was clean.  Wait staff effecient and courteous.
0,"After hearing that Macs was the best BBQ in Charlotte, I rushed right over.\n\nI've eaten there twice now, and both times I was disappointed.\n\nThe meat was tough and the sauces were good, but nothing special.\n\nBoth times I ate there I had the sneaking suspicion that I was just hitting them on a bad day, or an off time.\n\nI might give Mac's one more try before I drop it down to  two stars and give up on it forever.   I really want it to be as good as people say.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nI gave Mac's a 3rd try.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  It seems no matter what I order, the meat is always tough and dry.   \n\nI have, in fact, NEVER had a great meal there.   The best they seem to be able to offer is \""adequate\"".\n\nThey get 2 stars from me.\n\n(NOTE:  Mac's has other locations, and I did get a PHENOMENALLY GOOD brisket from one of their other stores)"
0,"Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car."
0,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype with this place. The food was overpriced for small portions and nothing special.\n\nI had the Alfredo penne pasta, some fondue for two, as well as a couple of slices of my friend's oven roasted tomato pizza. The pizza was VERY thin crusted and had a thin layer of tomato sauce as well as some pieces of cheese and tomatoes spread evenly across the top. It was honestly like a few sheets of paper stacked on top of each other for ~$14.\n\nAs for the pasta, it was again, nothing special. There wasn't really anything wrong with it other than the fact that it was ~$16 for like 4 bites. The taste was okay and was probably the best thing I ate there.\n\nFinally, the fondue for two was ~$25 for a plate of some strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a few brownies and cookies, marshmallows, and a scoop of ice cream. It was hardly worth the price.\n\nMy experience here was really disappointing and did not meet my expectations. The food didn't taste bad but it was definitely not worth it. I will say that our waiter was very friendly, patient, and talked with our group a lot. If it weren't for him, I'd probably rate this place 2/5. I don't expect to be coming back any time soon."
0,"I purchased a Groupon for this salon, based on the positive Yelp reviews.  The stylist I had seemed very apprehensive and inexperienced. It almost felt as if it was the first time he was cutting hair professionally (shakey and slow). \n\nHere's the kicker, I go to pay and asked what the original cost was (because I always tip on the original amount of the service) and the receptionist tells me its $35. The groupon I purchased was $30 (supposed to be a $70 value). I was shocked. I saved a total of $5 by purchasing the groupon. \n\nBottom line, they clearly reserve their higher level stylists for non-groupon clients. The whole point of the groupon is to try out a new salon and hopefully become a regular client. I suggest the folks at Folicle remember that moving forward."
1,"My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!"
0,"Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos."
0,First time I came here I ordered beef patties.  They didn't have any cooked so I bought them frozen. It was a bit of inconvenience but it was still good! \nToday I came once again no cooked beef patties and no frozen patties!! WTH!! Guess I'll find a new Caribbean restaurant.
0,"Just a couple of tips!\n\nDon't worry about getting the Frozen Hot Chocolate; it just tastes like a cheap milkshake--but if you have to get it at least once, I understand... I won't tell you what to do with your $10-$12\n\nAlso, if you get the Crab and Artichoke dip, be ready for lots of Krab and not a lot of Artichoke to put onto some burnt toast\n\nThen there is the hot dog--why would you even get a hot dog here? Pinks is RIGHT down the street, and it's legendary! This place... um, not so much.\n\nApparently the pizza was awesome, but that observation came from someone who was completely plastered--take this under advisement.\n\nOh! And the berries are fantastic as well as the fries.\n\nGet it girl!"
0,They never showed up for cleaning despite makindg the appointment days before. No calls to explain or apologize.
0,My chicken was undercooked and was onion filled in my chicken fajita pita made me not to ever get one again thanks a lot
1,"One of my favourite hangouts near UW campus. They have plenty of seats and is great for sipping some coffee or tea while listening to the din of pleasant conversation.\n\nTheir specialty coffees and teas are very good. They also serve an array of refreshing cool drinks. I love their desserts, especially the Belgian Waffles with Ice Cream. If you want, you can also order meals, but I'd stick to the soups and sandwiches. Their other entrees are overpriced and a little undewhelming.\n\nCan't say enough about their atmosphere and the drinks. If you've got an hour or two to kill with friends and want a good hang out, this is the place."
1,"Great place for fast Americanized Chinese food...think of it as a cross between Panda Express and PF Changs (which owns Pei Wei).\n \nI usually start  my meals here with some pork egg rolls and/or a bowl of wonton soup. They also have lettuce wraps that are pretty good. I usually get some kind of chicken entree here with brown rice, and among my favorites are orange peel chicken and pei wei spicy. If you are looking for a noodle dish, I'd recommend the dan dan noodles.\n\nThe employees here are great even when they make a mistake. They messed up my order the last time I was here and they apologized for it before I even had a chance to ask why my order was taking so long. They re-made it right away and the manager even refunded my money before I had a chance to say anything. If that isn't great customer service, I don't know what is!"
0,"f I could give them no stars I would, but for the sake of the rating system, one star it is.  While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!"
0,"Horrible!!!!!! All I got to say. I had just a pedi/Mani done with gel. After having to endure the painful pedicure and the \""lack\"" of foot rub.. Not to mention that I paid for a sea salt scrub, she out hardly put any salt scrub.. Painful! Now my natural nails are a decent length..He cut them down with out asking????? The sign said \""30 for Mani pedi and 15 for gel\"" my total was 65??? Why? No one would give me an answer! She just punched the total in the calculator that said 65. I get my nails done religiously every two weeks. I go to angelic nails on Valvista and warner they are amazing, give you water, talk to you and don't cause pain My total is always consistent 45 for Mani pedi and gel. Don't go here nails of the world unless you want to be broke"
1,Was in town for Labor Day and had a BLAST at this place!  Love dueling pianos. It felt like Silky O'Sullivan's on Beale (but classier).  Will frequent this place every time I'm in town!
1,"My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!"
1,"Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!"
0,"The food here is great, but I am very put off by the attitude of the hostess and the manager.  I was informed (quite rudely by both) that they do not take reservations on the weekends after 4:00 pm.  I was trying to have a birthday party there, and they absolutely refused to make a reservation for us-it is not convenient to have a party for someone and be made to sit around and wait for a table (especially a large party).  I do not recommend going there to celebrate any special occasion as they will not accomodate you in any fashion.  For me guest service is just as important as the food.  I will not be told how I am to be treated by them while I spend my money.  There are too many other restaurants to choose from."
1,"Service was great and the owners are nice. We got 6 donuts consisting of maple bars, the apple crumble, jelly, and glazed. They were reasonably priced and pretty good. I have them four stars because they are good, but not as good as Bosa. I would rank them also slightly worse than Krispy kremes"
0,"The only reason I will go back is if a band comes to town that I cannot miss.\n\nI'll start with the good.  Security is so friendly.  My friend proposed to his girlfriend and they were so helpful into making it happen.  If they kick you out, you deserve it!!\n\nParking sucks.  It costs money to park and they don't have many spaces.  You have to get early to park and it's really the only good parking around the venue.\n\nSound is meh.  I've heard better, not often do I hear worse.\n\nDRINKS ARE A RIP OFF!!!!  Either don't drink, come there drunk or sneak booze in (I don't support sneaking it in.  They do pat you down as you enter)\n\nSo what we have here is a rip off establishment that is one of the only places in town to see national touring acts.  Fuck it."
1,"On my way there, was cursing my GPS as I was SURE I was in the  wrong area, but lo and behold, I arrived.  Yes, it is off the beaten path, in an industrial area.  But a fun, kind of funky place.\n\nBeer is very good.  Just wish the sit down bar was situated in a area more toward the tanks, its just odd (IMO) near the front door.  But that is NOT a reason to not go.  Staff is friendly and engaging.\n\nIf you are local craft beer drinker, make a trip, it is worth it."
1,Lily Barajas is an awesome manager!! Just remember it takes time for the great food!!
0,"Coming from NYC where greasy Chinese food is on every block and at your door within minutes, Big Buddha lies pretty low on my fast food scale.\n\nI've only tried a handful of Chinese restaurants in Surprise and Big Buddha is by far my least favorite. I ordered the beef chow fun and garlic chicken on Saturday night and both were sub-par. \n\nThe beef chow fun was not good. The noodles stuck together and the veggies didn't seem fresh. It also tasted like someone just dunk a ton of soy sauce over the flat noodles. It was not appetizing at all.\n\nMy beau ordered the garlic chicken and it was not spicy whatsoever even though I asked them to make it spicy. \n\nIf you're looking for good Chinese food, I suggest Chen Wok. They're delicious and deliver!"
0,"This place is AWFUL. I have NOTHING nice to say about the Orleans!\n\nBack in December I went to a UNLV basketball game here. I stopped at the Mardi Gras bar before the game to grab a beer with my friends while we waited for the game to start. After drinking the entire beer, I glance at the bottom of my glass, only to find a THICK white film with 7 or 8 dead maggots INSIDE of the glass. After gagging profusely, I spoke to the Food & Beverage Manager, who had me fill out a report with security. I WISH I could post pictures here and show you what filth the Orleans serve to their customers! The response from the bartender who served me? \""My bad.\"" The response from the Food & Beverage Manager? \""Well, I'm sure it's nothing that will kill you.\"" Ummm, what?!?! Considering that NO ONE from The Orleans has tried to contact me to make sure that I actually didn't die from their foul casino and lax sanitary standards, how would they know?? I actually spent the next day vomiting, but I'm sure they don't actually care. \n\nFirst and last time I will ever set foot in this place. I filled out a report, they had all of my contact information - no one thought that maybe a phone call saying, \""I'm really sorry this happened to you\"" would have been in order? Thanks for nothing, Orleans!"
0,"The lobby is nice and people are friendly, that's all good until you get to your room.  First the window were so dirty that you could hardly see outside.  We had ticket from a dry cleaning from the people who stayed there before us that wasn't clean.  The table lamp wasn't even hook to the electricity so I had to crawl under the table. And the worst part, we had molds in the ceiling of our shower.  We asked the front desk to have someone come and clean it but it never happened.   I would not recommend this hotel.  there are so many other hotels that are so much better."
0,Average food. Great ambiance and service. The dumplings were outstanding! That's about it. I had some type of curry noodle dish with thin rice noodles. It tasted just like PF Changs - nothing special. I did order two orders of dumplings because they were so incredible. I would only come back for those.
0,"April 19, 2011, btwn 1:30p.m - 2p.m, I drove thru Wendys drive thru and ordered #3. Then I asked the lady if it comes with the sea salted french fries and her reply was \"" well thats the only fries we have\"" in a sarcasm VOICE! The reason I asked, was because the last time I was there, the fries tasted just like the regular one! So I said, \""I was only asking\"" and she was like \""wat else can I get for u\"" she sounded so irritated! I cancelled my order and wen to Rally's where they were able to provide me with great customer service! You see, I've been in the customer service field for quite sometimes. I try to delive the best I can in helping customer in every other ways I can. I expect to be treated the same. No matter how Irate or grumpy the customer gets, I don't let it bother me. Theres a reason that their like that. So whatever issue that cashier was having that day, I hope she learns not to let things get to her easily. I won't let her treatment towards me stop me from going to Wendys, I will not go to their location."
0,"The first time I went to this place I was very disappointed.  I ordered Pad Thai with tofu for takeout and when when I got home, there was absolutely no sauce or flavor to the noodles at all.  I guess when you order it not spicy, they just don't add anything to it? On top of that, the texture of the tofu was a little off and it felt overcooked.  The noodles also had a weird rubbery texture I've never experienced before. It was edible, but not good.  Perhaps I just didn't order it properly? \nSo a friend was visiting and we both had a taste for thai food. Nitaya was on our way to downtown so I decided we could give this place another try.  This time, I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu again, but I told them to make it Mild.  It was better than the first time I had it, but still kinda bland. The noodles were again really rubbery and just not appetizing. The portions are also kinda small for the price. I've eaten at MANY thai restaurants and this is unfortunately one of the worst. \nSorry, Nitaya Thai, I'll be trying the other thai options in town next time."
1,"I came here a couple times to kick it with some friends. The Hookah might seem expensive, but you can definitely hang there for a good 2-3 hours for 20 bucks. The booths are intimate and ample. Drinks are reasonable and the food is okay. They have a DJ spinning pretty good hip-hop/ethnic music. Bathrooms are clean enough, but I wouldn't recommend eating off the floors."

0,"among all the issues we had with this company, the most disappointing was mr. griffin's response to our request to complete the project. somewhat of a pay me first and i will be done with you when i am ready to attitude. my thought was that mr. griffin could have just picked up the final payment when the job was complete.  turns out that mr. griffin actually owed us money.  no apology, no rush, no thank you for spending 30K with my company... no way i would recommend this company to anyone."
0,If I could give 0 stars I would. I went in there in a lot of pain and the girl who did my massage her name is Carrie she was texting on her phone during my massage! Seriously!  Is that why they put the cold pack over your eyes so you can't see what they are really doing?!  I had gotten the 45 minute massage and every other place I've ever been to have you turn over onto your stomach so that they can do your back but she didn't! And that was where all my pain was so I lefty still in pain!! Worst massage EVER!!

1,"The Underworld\n\nIf you like scary movies then this place is for you!! Awesome decorations everywhere, and the bar staff has to be one of the nicest in Las Vegas. Always coming to the tables seeing if you want another beer, or anything else. Nothing on tap, but that's okay by me I like bottles. Mondays is Horror Movie Night with free candy and popcorn, plus they had a great variety show before hand that had the crowd laughing and having a great time.\n\nThis place is fun and amazing, and I will for sure be back time and time again"
1,"as the end of my third decade approached, i started to panic... how do i gracefully breeze through yet another milestone birthday with grace and style??  last year's nyc festivities were a trump card punctuated by le bernadin, but this year...it had to be bigger, better, faster, more.  what better place to indulge in excess than the city of sin, so away i went (with friends in tow) to celebrate the end of an era.  beyond the obligatory vices of vegas, my sights were sent on visiting jo\u00ebl robuchon, whom gault millau deemed chef of the century and michelin bequeathed the only three star rating between the east and west coasts. dressed in nothing less than my big pink quincea\u00f1era dress (because 15 x 2 seems much less daunting than a big bloated 30), i buckled in for a ride of four courses and accompaniments.  the french are experts at throwing in extra flair to make a girl feel special, and highlights included a formidable bread cart, surprise g\u00e2teau de c\u00e9l\u00e9bration, and let's not forget the special raspberry-pistachio pound cake parting gift  just for the ladies. oh, and did i mention the fernet & coke that kicked off the festivities?  of course i didn't need to, it's a prerequisite pour tout les joyeux anniversaires."
1,"I agree with Jacquie H. But as opposed to cloning on doc there are a good many docs they could clone at this hospital. Dr. Gus has put together one of the most impressive veterinary teams with a broad scope of skills and expertise that I have ever experienced. Dr. Koch is responsible for Saving my very small poodle who was severely injured by someone who abused her. Not only did he save her but he along with his staff supported us over a year long process to bring the abuser to justice, providing letters to the court, copies of medical documents on several occasions. The actions of every staff member in this hospital were not only a display of impeccable professionalism and care of the highest quality but a display of their true commitment to caring for animals. The patients that go to this clinic receive the best care possible and I suspect are cared for as well if not better than human patients in some clinics. \n\nI am committed 100% to this hospital as a result of their support and passion for veterinary care for animals. They are also committed to making sure that owners are educated and informed in caring for their pets. They present all treatment options to owners ranging from conservative in non urgent cases to aggressive care with a concise consultation on risk associated with each. This allows owner to make informed decisions. Physicians are supportive of pet owners and will weigh in on the decisions providing substantive and qualitative reasoning for their recommendations. \nAnother note to concerned pet owners in these difficult financial times is that when these vets present care options they do take into consideration conservative measures for non urgent situations and are very conscious of guarding against unnecessary test or diagnostics if they are not needed. This said if they highly recommend testing or diagnostics it is  generally to confirm that aggressive or costly treatments are actually needed and these test may in fact save money in the long run. They will also recommend test if the symptoms of the problem are too broad to narrow down what is truly wrong with an animal. \n\nGreat Medical team at this hospital , I could not ask for more."
1,Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.
0,"You ever work back of the house at a suburban chain restaurant? Picture that disgusting dish rack. The greasy ass floors. You crawl out like a slug at the end of your slimy shift.\n\nThat's this place.\n\nIt might be the setup--kitchen at the front and clogged lunch line blocking the door. It could be the low ceilings and wobbly cafeteria tables. It's possibly the abundance of grimy college kids taking a study break. No offense college kids, but your grimier activities elsewhere leave you thinking this is a safe haven. It's not.\n\nThe sandwiches are not good enough to justify how dirty you feel when you leave. So order to go? They take away your fries.\n\nBottom line: avoid this place. Spend an extra 20 minutes and catch the 61C towards the cleaner location in squirrel hill."
1,"I'm a hairstylist and I have worked with many make-up artists for films and special events. \n\nI'm so happy I recently had the chance to work with Jena! She did the make-up for a wedding I did the hair for. \n\nJena's make-up application for the bride, the brides mother and her 4 bridesmaids was classic yet modern. Everyone was glowing and their eyes stood out beautifully, especially the bride. She gave them exactly what every women wants on their wedding day, to look gorgeous and flawless. \n\nI would highly recommend Jena to anyone and here's why:\n\n1) She is a true professional!\n\n2) She asks questions and makes suggestions. \n\n3) She's prepared and works in a timely manner. \n\n4) Her make-up application enhances her clients beauty without being overly done.\n\n5) She is sweet and personable. \n\nI hope to get to work with her in the future and would feel comfortable knowing my own clients are in excellent hands with Jena."
1,"Love this place! I felt like I was at a lively shoreline restaurant because of the fresh decor and upbeat music. It's a nice, welcoming spot and a great alternative to typical Gilbert restaurants. During the day it's a family spot and in the evening, the lighting transforms this place to the perfect date night destination.\n\nFood: The food service was slow but worth the wait. The calamari was thicker than I prefer but my husband loved it but we were both in love with their clam chowder! It was rich and had tons of fresh clams. The lobster Mac n cheese and the tide roast lacked dimension but still good.\n\nI just wish they served the food at a higher temp. Everything was lukewarm but the kids' meal fries. Also would prefer different bread options. Their sour dough is really sour. I would also extend the non-alcoholic drink and desert menu. Just soda, tea, and lemonade. But if you are drinker, then you'll be in heaven.\n\nOverall great!"
1,"Located inside of Bellagio so of course this is not a jeans and t-shirt place.  It is classy and small.  They do need to do more things to bring more of a crowd in, besides their usual herding of the women with free drinks at night, hoping to draw the men in.  \n\nUsually, when you do go and have a drink there or two, they will give you a free entrance bracelet to the nightclub The Bank.\n\nAll in all, it is a great cozy place to go to, when you want to meet your friends for a drink and chat, before you head out to a loud, noisy bar/club and won't be able to hear what anyone has to say."
0,"I remember coming to this place in the 90's. I grew up in CA, so I was excited to eat here again. Haven't had it in years. Udon station is something they are known for. Pretty good, not as good as I remember however.\nNow I visited this place twice now and the first time the sushi was not too bad, but this time around it was just gross. Most everything didn't taste fresh and at 1pm, there was nothing but scraps left. I brought a friend from out of town and it was a little embarrassing. Only reason I am not giving them one star is due to the nostalgic factor, and that the first time I came in it seemed like a difference place. Don't think I would consider coming back."
1,"As it was Joe A. and my one year anniversary on Saturday, what better opportunity to try out Angels with Bagpipes! It had been on our radar for a while and now we've finally been.\n\nThe staff are lovely and friendly. They are very polite and go out of their way to accommodate you, but without being over the top.\n\nThe menu is mouthwatering and did not disappoint. I had a smoked salmon starter. The attention to detail was spot on. The piece of salmon was nice and chunky and garnished with bits of caviar, radishes, etc. Beautiful.\n\nFor my main course I unusually (not a big meat eater) went for the lamb. It was cooked beautifully and was really tasty.\n\nAlthough I was pretty stuffed, I still managed to squeeze in a dessert of a chocolate orange mousse. It was nice but would have been nicer if it was a bit lighter. A bit too rich after the other courses.\n\nMy only criticism would be that it was a bit chilly in there. Apart from that it was a nice, relaxing environment, friendly and down to earth staff, and the food was delicious. I wouldn't go here all the time, but it is nice for a special occasion :)"
1,"Conveniently located to where I'm at. Menu looks tastefully planned. On my first visit, I ordered the white fish special. Although I was called to return back to work immediately, I had to @least get a quick taste before asking for it to get wrapped up to go! I must say, that one taste gave me the craves to wanting to just  finish it! LOL The service was politely excellent and I assure you & them that i will be back when I EVER get the free time away from work! Oh, I have to also mention that I went there w/my son on national pizza day that day, and my son ordered 2slices of their pizza, well being that he is a pizza fanatic since childhood, he was pretty much satisfied. So if you're wanting that pizzaria pizza and some good wholesome pasta dishes, then I suggest that you come on down and check it yourself, because it's \""Mama Mia mmm mmm good!\"" LOL Oh! And plenty of parking as well! Bravo smooches!"
0,"I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fianc\u00e9 is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had. \nMia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte."
0,"The Front Desk staff is the antithesis of hospitality. When checking in, we were informed that, without reservation, there was a walkin rate of \""x\"" per night, after pulling up a reservation of \""y\"" per night on Expedia. With no \""option\"" to honor a competitive rate, we were made to literally sit in the lobby, book the reservation through a third party and then wait another 10 minutes for the reservation to populate in the aloft system. The gentleman, \""Dee,\"" who assisted us was one of the least accommodating people in the business, busy on his personal phone half the time and second only to his a.m. counterparts who were equally displeasing at checkout. \n\nThese people are your first and last impression, aloft- get it together. Your employees just earned you a scathing Yelp! review, a vacation horror story in customer service and about 20 less future customers, in the immediate. Congrats!"

1,"Well, my husband and I LOVE culinary dropout ...they don't have one in Southern California yet that I know of but we usually make it a point to come here every time were in AZ. We visit family here and my husband works here so when we get the chance to come we always do. We have never been disappointed . I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit. Can't wait - foods great and drinks are creative"
0,"First off - great job by the technician that came out to clean the windows.\nIssue is that the price that he then wanted to charge us was TWICE what was quoted over the phone (Bait and Switch??).  It appears that the person who gave the quote over the phone did not explain how they count windows, did not communicate to the tech what the quote was - or if he did, the tech did not clarify the difference in pricing until after he finished the work.\nBecause of the amount they wanted to charge, and we finally paid, was significantly different than was quoted or clarified before work was completed - I would not recommend them unless they clean up their pricing practices."
0,"Just about the worst event I could imagine.  My brother and his wife were in town and I was embarrassed to have taken them to an event like this.  I also treated a chef friend of mine to it - and even though he didn't pay for his ticket I was also sorry to have brought him as well.  \nI'll just quickly rehash all the issues.\n\n1) Lines were way too long.  You stood in line for 30-60 minutes at a time for, at most, a few bites of food.\n2) The food, when you got it, wasn't good.  There were some standouts but most of the places served terrible food.  Even great places I know like Raku dipped their meat in a bucket of teriyaki sauce.\n3) Special shout out to Jet Tila and Eddie Huang for perhaps the worst experience of the night.  Subjected to a long line while the chefs and his buddies took time out to booze it up, spend minutes at a time talking to who knows whom, and the chef himself light heartedly but LOUDLY chastising one of his cooks for apologizing for the wait with this gem - \""Hey man, don't ever apologize for how long it takes to produce art.\""  Art being dry, terrible bao bun, an overcooked pork belly, and over sauced short rib in the taco.  I mean, they DRENCHED that taco in sauce.  And the sauce was gross.  I guess the tortilla for the taco was fine though.  :)  I had to give a special shout out to those jackasses.  Because their food is nowhere near good enough to have that kind of ego.  \n4) Many of the vendors closed TWO HOURS before the event ended.  What?!  \n\nI like the idea.  And I would give it another chance.  But triple the number of vendors or don't put it on groupon and keep the number of people down.  It was absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI will give a positive, not sarcastic, shoutout to Shirley Chung of China Poblano.  That sandwich and those ribs were delicious!"
1,"After asking a friend of mine of where to go - I took my SUV down to Island Auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car.  The owner was really nice and honest - he didn't give me the run-around or try to overcharge me.  My car was repaired well, and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me.  Will be back again!"
1,"Typical SW. The staff is friendly. Sometimes, flights to/from here get really booked, especially when it's during snow season and everyone's trying to go eastward. I never had any issues with my flight, thank goodness. Their gates are super crowded though. So if you want to sit down and wait for you flight, get here early."
1,"Absolutely love the encore, food and live jazz. They have the best green Chile pork I have ever had. I live their wood fired food. We also shared the French Bacon burger on fresh bread. The very best bloody Mary's ever. This place just feels right. An absolute must when we are on town."

0,"Disappointing dinner ~  I can't understand why there was such a long wait to get into this place.  My friend and I likely would have had a better meal over at AJ's.  The acoustics are horrendous - I had to scream at my friend the entire evening.  When we were finally seated, before we could even hang our purses on the back of our chairs, a server was there asking for our order.  Apparently, we were supposed to study the menu during our 40 minute wait.  Clearly wanting to get us in and out, our food arrived a little too quickly.  I had the Curry Vegetables - horrible - some of the veges were way under ripe (broccoli was more white than green) and undercooked (yes, I know they should be crunchy).  The sauce was bland.  Even the rice wasn't good - how does an Asian place screw up rice?  There were no seasonings/condiments on the table other than the obligatory Kikkoman's.  We were ignored until it was check time.  I know it was a busy Friday evening, but that doesn't mean service and food quality should go by the wayside.  Kudos to the owner for actually being there, although it's not really a shock she would like to show her face considering there's two large pictures of her right when you walk in the door."
0,"Asian buffets scare me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling. Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.\n\nMicrowavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, mushy sushi, and fatty meats. Their desserts were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.\n\nLots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited."
0,"I lived right across the street and feel obligated to try anything new downtown.  My boyfriend's daughter was in town so we though it would be a fun place to try.  Maybe they are just settling in at the moment.  His daughter thought the shake was gross which i have to concur, it wasn't sweet at all.  We got the biggest of the burgers just to go all out and were disappointed with the quality of that as well.  However, when we ordered \""shots\"" of Jager they came in glasses and were probably equal to about 3 shots.  So if you order a drink be ready for a hang over.  Overall we wanted to give the experience a try, but we likely won't be back."
1,"I went to Dillons planning to have a serious conversation with friends last night, so the food was not  top on the list of my priorities.  In spite of that I was impressed by the food and the service.  I appreciated the fact the server was very knowledgable about was being served.  She also gave some real thought to questions concerning the sauces  and recommendations we asked her to make.  She also kept our drinks flowing moderately including keeping my water glass topped off.  As i don't drink, often times, I end up with a half empty glass which I invariably have to ask to get refilled.  Not so here;  udos to the server.\n\nI had the pulled chicken sandwich which certainly tender enough with a very fresh bun.  The mild sauce was about what our server said it would be.  Next time I will go for something stronger though.  Concerning the goal of the evening, I was going very mild in everything I ate.  The potato salad had a nice flavor but was just a scoop in a little bowl.  One of my pet peeves, it just looked boring.\n\nWhat really surprised me as it would have been the last thing I'd have ever ordered was my friends stew.  The stew was a luscious combination of meat and vegetables.  It almost looked almost like a thick soup.  I like it when something just looks like it would be something I'd really like to have just seeing it. .  My friend said it was as appetizing as it looked.  This is what I will have the next time I go there.\n\nNo problems parking but this was during the middle of the week so don't know about weekends."
0,"As hard as it is to give Salsarita's a bad review My experience today just topped it.  First let me say that this bad review is for this location.  I have never had bad experiences at the other locations, but this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience here.  First, I arrived at 1:30 PM which I would think would be after the lunch crowd, but the line was almost out the door.  At first there were only three people working the line, but eventually it got to five.  Also, when I ordered the taco salad (the Thursday special) they were almost out of romaine lettuce.  If this was my first experience at Salsarita's I probably wouldn't come back.  I think I'll be done with this location, cannot wait until the Quail Corners location reopens."
0,"Was very excited to eat at a GR place since my whole family watches all his shows and I own several of his cookbooks. Ordered the burger medium it came out raw. However they didn't refire it. They gave a whole new burger. The fried calimari must have been baby squid as the ring size was infinitesimal and all breading. Then the fish for the fish and chips just didn't taste good at all. However the star was the 3 mini pies. Steak and ale, Shepards and chicken pot."
0,"Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink.

0,"Hungry for lunch and not wanting to walk any further my husband and I decided to give nordstrom cafe a try. They have a self order counter where you give your cashier your order and pay for your meal before choosing a table. The cashier was not welcoming,disinterested and rude. Surprising to me as I have always admired  nordstroms commitment to providing great customer service. After sitting down we were shortly greated by the server. I asked her what the cashiers name was. She said \""Why you don't like her\"" I told her she was very unwelcoming and she said we were the third table to complain about her that night. The food was good although I don't know if ill be back if the beginning of my meal starts out so unpleasant."
0,"Had occasion to stay here recently due to a having an evening planned there. First of all, this place is showing its age a bit. The Front Desk staff were OK, a little rushed and not too friendly. Getting to your room here is a hassle. I'm a bit resentful of being forced to drag our bag through the entire casino to get to the elevators. I'm also resentful of paying $252.00 for an old room and getting shanked for a $25.00 \""resort fee\"". This is just a straight rip off, a \""because we can F*ck You\"" fee."
0,"I was very disappointed in my Sushi Roku experience! Wanted a find a hip sushi spot in Scottsdale for a bachelorette party; my first thought was Stingray but they don't take reservations and I didn't want to chance it with a party of 14, so we made a reservation at Roku.\n\nOur party arrived in high spirits, already several bottles of champagne deep, decked out in bachelorette-party attire. No penis straws or necklaces - we stay classy - but lots beads, sashes, tiaras, etc. We had only one waiter assigned to our party of 14, which would have been fine if he had been more competent. He was slow (apparently both in server speed and intellect), boring and could not have been less friendly. We had to repeat our orders to him several times, he was awkward and strange, and didn't even comment on the fact that we were clearly celebrating a bachelorette party.\n\nThe sushi came slowly and sporadically, was \""ehhh\"" at best, and the cocktails were AWFUL. I had to send a couple back to the bar and I was already buzzing so you know they must have been pretty bad.\n\nThe place is somewhat expensive too, so save your cash and check out other trendy sushi spots in town like Stingray, Kabuki...even RA is a better bet than this place."
0,"Despite the questionable reviews, I really wanted to like BarMasa. The restaurant has a grand reputation back at home base in New York, but the Vegas location does not deliver.\n\nThe food at Masa was good. Not great, not exciting, just good. For a check to come out to $180 for 2 people and , even at a high end restaurant, and only provide so little satisfaction,  is simply unacceptable.\n\nBetween myself and my dad, we had chicken yakitori, shrimp fried rice, wagyu beef fried rice, and a piece of o-toro for myself (I can never resist)\n\nThe chicken was ok, but incredibly small pieces on the skewers.  4 times more expensive than the next most expensive yakitori i've ever ordered, and i've had a lot of yakitori in my day.\n\nThe rice dishes were ok, but not particularly better than what i'd eat an any local chinese takeout in any town in america.\n\nThe toro was delicious, as toro should be. That being said, even in a fine Tokyo establishment they have given me at least a larger piece that the minuscule morsel at Masa.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's a nice place, it really is. between the high ceilings, minimalistic interior, and low seating, the openness of the place felt off for a restaurant though. Kind of like an airport terminal. \n\nThere is plenty of Japanese food to be found in Las Vegas, and it's sure to be cheaper and better. There is absolutely no reason to choose BarMasa."
0,"I was expecting an outstanding spa experience in Vegas, only to be left feeling disappointed with the services. i expected to pay a little more for the service than at home, but the spa was just dirty. There was hair clogging all the sinks and shower drains, the robes were raggedy. I couldn't believe the conditions of the slippers and robes. The drinks consisted of water with apple slices and they had oranges and apples for snacks for the women, but my husband said he didn't have the fruit on his side. One of my services was a 25 min facial. Nothing specials, no extractions, just massage and cream. The only other services that were part of the spa was a steam room, a whirlpool and a cool water pool. Very disappointed with the whole scene especially since it is the only thing I look forward to doing when coming to Vegas.\nI think I would be the extra money and try a spa at another hotel on the strip."
0,"I've been here a couple of times and I still don't get the hype. The food is decent but nothing special compared to any other Tex-Mex restaurants in Charlotte. Their tableside guacamole was good and they did make it very spicy like we asked. And their jalepeno margaritas are delicious. But their actual dishes are just whatever. \n\nOne reason I'm knocking them down to two stars is their service. The first time I went, the girl seemed very irritated that we were in there so late (only an hour and a half before they closed. Geez). The second time, the guy kept acting like any request we made was a joke. \""can we get the tableside guac?\"" \""ha...sure. ....oh really?\"" i know it was kind of busy but we are very patient and very good tippers so we were serious. Then when I asked for a box for my quesadillas, I also asked for a side of sour cream and salsa. (to which he replied \""to eat here? Hahah ok?\"" \""no....for home\"" what a weird question) The box came out about 15 minutes later and was just thrown down as he was walking to the next table. I then had to ask for the sides again. We had already paid and everything and after another 15 minutes of nothing, we just left.\n\nI want to give them one more chance as far as service goes bc it's the only neighborhood Mexican restaurant and I want to experience what everyone else has experienced. But I'm serious...one more chance.."
1,Simply delicious food...great food and love the ambience as it is in the fashion square mall... I can't get enough of this Mexican food... Also have drink specials during happy hour time... Love it love it love it... You cannot miss this place for its fajitas...
0,"The whole Somerset Academy system is very deceptive and unethical in their admissions policy.  They will lie to you about your child getting in, due to an incompetent admissions staff, and then do everything they can to not address and cover up for their lie.  Yes, their lie is documented in writing.\n\nThe front desk can be down right aggressive towards parents of students, the other reviewer is correct.  \n\nYou had better hope your child doesn't need extra help after school if they are struggling, because they don't offer it."
0,"Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.  \n\nI would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again."
1,"This place is really good.  There are five meats (pork ribs, beef ribs, fried chicken, catfish, and perch), and with your meat you get two sides (e.g., collard greens, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, sauteed veggies) and a bread (corn muffin, hush puppies, or dinner roll).  This is for about $8 combined, and you can also order the sides separately.  Plus there are desserts like sweet potato pie and lemon cake.\n\nDoug cooks up all the dinner food in the back, and his wife makes the desserts and does the table service in the front.  That is pretty adorable.  The food is good - no crazy frills, not particularly refined, but solid.  The fried chicken is particularly tasty, with a thin but very crispy skin and super juicy interior.  I also thought the mac and cheese and collard greens were highlights.  The pork ribs were actually underwhelming at the restaurant, but they were significantly better heated up at home the next day.\n\nThere are about 10 tables in the storefront, but you can also do takeout.  There was not a lot of business when I was there on a Wednesday night, probably because the location is kind of out of the way.  But, you should make it a point to go.  In my opinion, Doug's is a clear winner over Kip's, even though Kip's is also good."
1,"Oatmeal Cookie Yogurt????  It is the best I have ever had.   I have been at least 3 times a week for the past month!  I hope its low fat, but really I don't care, its worth it.  I love this place, the people are friendly and very helpful!  I will be visiting again tomorrow!!"
0,Very pricy for the quality of food you get...definitely don't come here for the service.
0,"STRANGE place, unique form of BBQ (I'd consider myself well traveled) and know HOW MANY differences BBQ has across our Nation.\nFirst: The set up is quite different...you leave your order at the 'bar'/check out/cashier. That same person is also the waiter, bartender, cashier and when the place is busy...well it is confusing then. \nSecond:The food~quite pricey for a BBQ joint. I had a wing plate for $11. (to go) this time. The wings were big, cooked well, but no visable BBQ sauce on them. I'm not sure, but there was a teeny cup of something white that might have been some ranchy dsg, but I don't like ranch so I didn't try it. With the platter I chose side of slaw. Sides are also in the same teeny portions as the sauce (I'm disappointed). There was a LARGE brick style piece of cornbread, but the texture was not your usual cornbread density, but more like a sponge and on the dry, tastless side. I think there were jalapenos in it but it was too dry to care about. Unique slaw...with more than enough green pepper & strings of red onion throughout it. It really wasn't a vinegary slaw and absolutely wasn't mayo-based either...their own style I suppose. \nLastly: Their location is right on the main drag in Matthews. BUT where it is situated you can't park at the restaurant, you park in a lot or on the street and walk to the place. NO drive thru available at all, either. I cannot say the food was bad, just not like ANY other BBQ I have ever eaten in any state. For the $$ and the odd way to order/wait...I won't be back any time soon. The young man running the whole show was polite and nice enough, I just think he needs some helpers AND/OR they need a different way to handle busy times."
0,"Someone needs to do some serious phone training at this location.I've ordered from here before, but they were never a staple for me. But my roommate was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance, and they prominently advertised a gluten-free crust option, so we started ordering from here instead of our preferred (pricier) pizza place.\n\nOrder #1: Took me 5 minutes to explain to the person taking my order over the phone that I wanted sausage added to a base special pizza. Really not that complicated. An hour and fifteen minutes pass, no pizza. Tried to call and inquire. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 5 minutes. Hung up. Called back. Refused to let them immediately place them on hold (much to the person taking my call's surprise) and managed to ask my 15-second question. (I wanted to verify that the order had gone through, given the uncertainty level of the person who took it.)\n\nOrder #2: Placed online. Ordering system doesn't tell you an estimated timeframe of when your pizza will be ready for pickup. Called to ask. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 3 minutes. Hung up. Called back. This time was actually allowed to talk to a human and ask my 5-second question. Went to pick up my pizza and watched them place someone else on hold indefinitely as we left even though no one was in line behind us.\n\nI know this is a nitpick, but it really is atrocious from a service standpoint, and guys, this ISN'T HARD. If you have a customer in front of you, put the caller on hold, and then help them before you take the next customer. If you're too slammed to do that, at least pick up the phone between customers and let the person you've put on hold indefinitely know that you haven't forgotten about them and someone will be with them shortly. This is sort of Retail Phone Service 101.\n\nThe pizza is fine. It's nothing spectacular, but it's good. Some of the toppings are interesting but overall it's good Basic Utility Pizza, the kind of thing you order if you're having a party and want something nicer than Pizza Hut. I like the calzones because they're the size of my head and last two meals easily, but they do usually arrive still cold in the middle. Overall, it's pretty underwhelming, and certainly not worth braving godawful service for. I might still snag a calzone every so often, but the phone manner the last few times had me googling whether our favorite place DID have gluten free crust after all, and lo and behold they do, so our actual pizza orders are headed right back to Roman Candle where they apparently should've just stayed."
1,"We had a great time.  I had hoped for a little better beer selection to go with the burgers, but I managed to find something I like.  I had the \""Gordon Burger\"" which was on special and came with avocado and duck bacon.  It was quite good.  We ordered some sweet potato fries and some truffle fries.  The truffle fries could've been dialed back a notch, but they were good.  Sweet potato fries came with powdered sugar and some kind of non-descript Jello-pudding-looking sauce.  My wife had the Britannia burger, which she liked, though she did have to send it back to get the chutney that comes with it.  Sending back a dish at a Ramsay restaurant brought a smug satisfaction that money can't buy.  We all had a good laugh about it.  Our server was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great.  The price was appropriate."
1,"Chicken cobb pool-side\nSprouts, avocado, so good!\nSix dollar Cokes - bargain?"
1,"OMG SO GOOD! Get the all-you-can-eat sushi! Unlike most places, they will give you all you can eat SASHIMI (fish WITHOUT the rice), which is unusual because AYCE places usually want you to fill up on rice--not this place! Sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are really cool! Oh and if you are a \""good looking lady\"" and you go in after midnight, you get a discount. Can't remember how much, but still kind of funny."
0,"The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night. \n\nJust stop and think about that for a moment.\n\nYou have a baby.................. in a bar???\n\nTo add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy. \n\nFinally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):\n\n\""If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria\""\n\n\nOh, PS...

0,"The good: The music was good if you like Hip Hop, decor was good, people were fine.\n\nThe bad: Place was a mosh pit. The dance floor is tiny, there's NO room to walk through AT ALL. Line for bathrooms was so bad, we just went back to our rooms to use the bathroom and were so over the crowds we didn't bother going back (stayed at the Luxor). A busy club is a good thing but for f***'s sake I think being able to get through the club w/o almost fighting 3 people is not too much to ask for.\n\nBTW, suggestion for the DJ, playing \""Move Bitch\"" by Ludacris NOT a good idea in that club...suggestion hits too close to home."
0,"Stumbled upon Chef Ben's and decided give it a shot. Gotta say the prices are what brought us (my daughter and I) in. It seemed fairly priced, clean looking, yet it was not quite welcoming. We ordered the chicken teriyaki,  teriyaki two, and what is usually my favorite, the eel roll. I was completely unsatisfied, the chicken was dry, the beef seemed to be low quality and a bit dry as well. I was most let down by the roll though. I asked the gentleman taking my order \""is the eel fresh water or not?\"" His response, \""yes.\"" I definitely do not believe it to have been fresh water at all. I have had eel numerous times and at plenty places yet have never had such a salty and fishy tasting roll. The taste was overwhelming and I could not force myself to suck down a second bite."
1,"I have Been here a handful of times.  I really appreciate the ambiance inside this eatery.  The bar area is dark enough to sit at and feel relaxed and comfy with a slight feeling of sophistication.  Also, the booths give me a feeling of privacy which is nice for having conversations with friends.  Everyone that I know loves this place and has always recommended it to me so when I finally tried the food, I was pleased.  Although, I might add, the pasty's are kind of heavy as they tend to be meat, potato, gravy, and pastry based so it's not a food meant for light eating in the summer heat.  Good food, reasonable rates, and good drinks.  Eat there."
0,"Don't trust this company with your pet!  \n\nI've boarded my dog many times in the past with never an issue. Apparently, they told me after boarding my dog for a three day business trip, that they had her confined to the 3 feet by 6 feet kennel for almost the entire three days and nights due to \""behavioral problems\"". The issue is, I never received a phone call and if I knew my dog was in the kennel for three full days and nights I would have had a friend pick her up. This was borderline animal abuse!  Why collect people's phone numbers if you don't call them if there is a problem?"
0,"So I've heard everyone rave about this place but every time we've come here, there is always at least an hour wait. So we decided to come early today to avoid a wait...only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends (our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car). We tried to be flexible but it was like they didn't care for our business...looks like it was never meant to be. They didn't even try to offer an explanation for their policy. Don't think I'll try to eat here again...not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it!"
1,"Every time we've been to Plaza Bonita (PB as it's now known) we've enjoyed ourselves. The staff is so nice and makes you feel welcome. The food comes out hot, quick, and fresh. The camarones mexicanos is one of my favorite dishes as is the healthy chicken burrito. I love the vegetables they fill it with. My boyfriend has a combo platter with a chile relleno, tamale, and enchilada. All were fantastic!! And that's coming from a Mexican woman who makes tamales every year for Christmas. \n\nOne of our favorite things about this place of course are the margaritas!! I think we've tried every one of them two times over...not sure what that says about us, but...\n\nWe also love the colorful decor of the place, it really reminds me of Jalisco, Mexico. Some people may disagree but I wish they'd play music, at least during the evenings and on weekends. We're so happy a place like this has come to our neck of the woods!"
1,"This review is mainly based on the Chihuly Exhibit and the wonderful job Desert Botanical Gardens does to keep this place looking simply fabulous.\n\nBeen here a few times throughout my stay in PHX and each time we come back it gets better and better. The place looks a lot bigger than we remembered and had more paths and special interest to enjoy than last time.\n\nCame with the family and used a Groupon thingamajig. Daughter is a coupon clipper and did a great job on this one. We could not decide whether to see the Chihuly exhibit at night or first thing in the morning. Granddaughter was with us so we decided to go with the early morning adventure and we were not disappointed.\n\nWow is all we can say. What an amazing selection of cactus, desert trees and bushes from all over the world. There are even wildflowers and tons of different critters and birds that make themselves right at home. It was fun watching everyone shooting pictures of just about anything that moved or sweet family photos next to something extravagant or amazing.\n\nThis is always been a great place to take people from out of town or just a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the heavenly works sent from above. We probably walked close to a couple of miles before we were done.\n\nBring your sunscreen, shady hat, some good walking shoes and plenty of liquids to drink. The dessert can take the life right out of you if you are not careful. So be cool and stay hydrated and rest in the shade when you get a chance. MOST EXCELLENT!\n\n4.75 STARS"
0,"Very disappointed. I have used them numerous times and I have never seen the lack of care that these 2 guys gave my stuff. Jose smelled of smoke and alcohol. Harold seemed nice but as the move progressed...he got moodier and took less care of my stuff. I have used champion movers before (different guys) and normally everything takes abt 2 hours. Right now I am looking at over 3 hours and they are still not done. They have broken things, dropped boxes and spilled things. The only way that anything in my boxes would have spilled is if they carried the boxes upside down. Now I have to wonder, why carry a box upside down???? I'm very disappointed in Champion Movers today. Not sure if I will use them again after this. Very very disappointed!!!! Maybe they should be more careful abt who they hire as movers in the future. These 2 guys have made Champion Movers who I have always raved abt look very very bad!!!"
1,I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!
0,"Yeah, I dont think we will be coming back any time soon here either. I dont know what has happened to this place over the last year, but something really bad has happened to it. \n\nThe water pitcher had someone's hair in it. The waiter made us feel like he was doing us a favor by serving us. The eggs benedict was cold, and so were the potatoes, so we waited 10 minutes for the waiter to come around to sent them back. They came back again cold. By this time the rest of the family had finished their meal so I said screw it, ate the potatoes cold, paid, and left. Gave them a sub-par tweet and they replied that they wanted to make things right with us. Still havent heard back from them. Im done."
1,"Vietnamese food made by (lovely!) Vietnamese family. They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.\n\nEstablished in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \n\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall."
1,"We had an amazing time! Our hosts we wonderful and generous. They made sure everyone enjoyed themselves. Definitely have recommended it to everyone I know, and let me tell you, they can not wait to try this!!! Don't miss out on a great deal on a very good time in LV."
1,"Free wifi is a theme of all my reviews, and they have it here. There is also a fire going, a coal fire. The bartender let me have a piece of coal yesterday because it was the first time I had ever seen coal. He was amused. I was told it might be radioactive, and I left it in a cafe I was in. In hind sight, I think at was not very nice. \nAnyway. You can also put on any music you want, and their music is pretty terrible. So I always hook up an iPod. \nThey are chill about my writing group meeting here even if people only get soda water, though I have taken on an afternoon scotch habit. They can't do manhattans or old fashions, which is why I dock a star, because that's lame. Is this a bar or an alcohol stand at a fair?"
1,The burger was great and we had excellent customer service. Friday's are very busy. This is a great place for families.
0,"Bad Attitude - Well, that about sums it up. I moved out to the north valley in July of last year and thus far have spent $1900 at this shop. On two occasions I have had to deal with attitude from one of the bike mechanics there - big guy with the beard. I took my road bike in today to ask a question and the condescending mechanic only made fun of how old my bike is - yep, it's a vintage 2003 model. Not the best bike in the world but it has been a great ride for 11 years.  He also felt compelled to tell me \""you really need a new bike but don't worry it won't make you any faster\"". Here's the kicker, I did a race last weekend and decided I was going to upgrade before my next one in September. Sorry Bicycle Vibe, I'll be taking the $4K I have for my new purchase elsewhere. \n\nWhy do people have to talk down to others? Did that really make him feel better? Not only did he have a chance to make a great sell and win a customer, he had a chance to be nice to another human being. Does it really matter how old your bike is? It would be so cool to have a nice bike shop here up north, without the attitude."
1,"Pizza is just about the right size for a quick lunch, try the firecracker crust, not real spicy but has some taste to it. Only down side is crust is a little soggy for me, not a deal beaker but a little crisp to the bottom would be better.  Neat idea and pretty tastey all the way around."
0,"My friends and I went came here during opening weekend (4/28, Laidback Luke).  I'll give credit where credit is due - the light show/lasers in the main room are production heavy and give Hakkasan some credibility.   Also, the DJ in the hip hop room was on point last night, throwing down hit after hit!  You could tell the crowd was really into it (and even some of the bouncers couldn't stop dancing).  \n\nCons:\n- Ladies, the elevators are reserved for bottle service patrons only.  This means you'll have to walk up four flights of stairs to get to the main level, and walk back down four flights of stairs to exit.  \n***TAKE NOTE:  I made a comment to the bouncer at the elevator that making girls in 5 inch heels walk so many stairs to get out is not the business, and, I kid you not, he told me \""WEAR FLATS NEXT TIME\"".  Are you for real??   I've told this story at least 10x in the past 12 hours and you can bet I'll keep telling it until your employees learn to show some class.\n- I didn't buy any drinks last night but my guy friends did.  Expect to pay $18.50 for a Redbull Vodka.\n- This club is probably 20% walk way/dance foor, 30% stairs, and 50% tables.  Everywhere you look, there are tables upon tables.  I get this is the kind of clientele you're trying to attract, but frankly I found it to be total overkill, especially since so many of the tables went empty.\n\nI had an 8am flight to catch this morning and initially, I was bummed I'd have to leave early to catch some sleep.  Then I actually experienced the club first-hand and was quite grateful to have an excuse to leave well before Laidback Luke even got on.  My friends didn't have the same early-flight excuse but left shortly after I did.\n\nHakkasan definitely has some big issues to work out.  Until then, I'll stick to XS and Marquee!"

1,"This is definitely a 4-4.5 star hotel that is on the grand scale.  The outside of this hotel brings back memories of Venice, Italy albeit all condensed together in the \""front yard.\""  The decor is stunning if not over the top throughout this hotel with a lot of \""wow factor.\""\n\nThere are gondolas that travel through the shops area with singing gondoliers and beautiful \""walk-over bridges.\"".  One thing about this hotel is it is always packed full of people.  The Phantom of the Opera show was very nice and again draws a lot of people.  The shops are upscale but not the top designers.  The restaurants are average to fine dinning with a food court in the casino.\n\nThe rooms set a standard in Vegas.  They are large all suite rooms featuring a sitting area with a sofa that converts to a bed.  Again, over the top Italian decor but luxurious non-the-less.  I believe the smallest rooms are 800-900 sqft and the upper floors hold rooms that can be jaw dropping.\n\nWith all of the decor and the phenomenal club TAO it still is only a 4-4.5 star hotel next to the Wynn/Encore, Bellagio, or Caesars."
1,"Love love love this place!  No where else have I been able to eat my own vegetarian diet while watching my husband blissfully eat his carniverous one!  He says the pulled pork sandwich is his favorite, followed by the ribs.  I am just so happy I can find tofu AND seitan cooked well in this town! I like getting the TV tray dinner, which I still have not been able to finish but gives me the option to ahve a variety of different dishes.  Oh, and the cornbread is AMAZING! Great selection of beers, fun place to watch a game or grab dinner.\nMindy, the server, is awesome too!"
1,"I have been going to Jimmy Johns Sandwich shop for 2 years now.I absolutely love there sandwiches and trust me Im a big fan. But today when I came in I was very disappointed. When I received my #9 I had ask the nice guy at the counter for 4 out of the hundereds that were in the giant box of packets of yellow mustard. He said he was only able to give me 2, 2 packets of yellow mustard for the giant sandwich I had in front of me was a joke. He said he would have to charge me 25 cents for a 5 cent packet of mustard. Thats like going to Mcdonalds and ordering 2 large frys and getting two packets of ketchup to fulfill your needs. When I asked Derek why would he have to charge a absurd price he stated \""Because Jimmy doesnt want you to ruin your sandwich\"". Iam from the greatest country on Earth the United States of America,If I want to I should have the right to put what ever I please on a sandwich. I understand that Derek was doing his job and doing what he was told, so I asked for the \""head\"" manager he directed me to Maranda(mustard natzi) a short overweight bitter woman, you could tell she was picked on in school by the look on her face and it was her mission to get back at the world. Anyways she was sitting there while all this was happening and she heard everything that was said. She would not give me the time of day, all she said was \""company policey\"" then  continued to do what ever it was she was doing. This is not right. I had to buy some candy from a local 7-11 just to get my mustard packets. This was the worst experice Ive ever had at one of there locations."
0,"From what I gather, China Poblano is supposed to be a fusion restaurant--fusing the flavors of China and Mexico.  But it's poorly executed.  There's no fusion about it.  The Chinese dishes come from one kitchen; the Mexican dishes come from another.  But they're completely separate concepts mishmashed into one (loud) restaurant.  Nothing blew any of us away...but the check sure did.  I gather that it's supposed to be served tapas style...but I'm pretty sure that takes away from part of what I love best about eating Chinese and Mexican foods: over-indulgence on the cheap.  China Poblano misses the mark."
0,"I brought my car in because the check engine light came on stating it was a small vapor leak in the fuel system. They quoted me $60 to find out what was wrong with it. Brought it in, and they couldn't find the problem because they needed to a more extensive smoke test to find where the leak was which costs $200. However they said they would deduct the first $60 from the cost and credit the total diagnostic expenses toward the repair. I brought it back for the smoke test and they stated a gasket at the fuel sending unit needed to be replaced which was a $25 part. Total cost was around $240 with taxes. As soon as I drove home, the check engine light came on again for the same problem. Brought it back for the 3rd time, and they stated there was a clamp the mechanic didn't tighten properly which caused it. Great. Soon as I drove home again the light came on again. I went back again for the 4th time and they redid the smoke test. They discover the fuel sending unit itself was leaking and was hoping it was just the gasket. They quoted $270 for the part and 4 hours of labor to change it out. They stated they would only charge me 3 hours because of the prior diagnosis. Unfortunately, I had already paid for 2 hours of labor not 1 hour, but they wouldn't give me the credit as promised initially. In addition, I found out on the mercedes forums that the problem is very common, but it only takes 2 hours to do the job. I confronted them with this and Charles denied it stating it would be a minimum 3 hour job. I went to Schumacher Mercedes dealership and bought the original part for $230 from their parts department and changed the fuel sending unit myself. I followed the instructions posted on the forums by other members and finished the job in an hour and a half easily. In addition, I also inquired about a burning rubber smell coming from the engine. They said it was the expansion plugs at the back of the engine that were leaking oil onto the exhaust - easy fix 1 hour job $200. I found out that the plugs were just plastic caps that costed $25 from the dealer and took 10 minutes to change out - simply pry off with a screwdriver and pop back in. This is what happened when I went there. Wouldn't recommend going there even if their labor rate is $98 or whatever compared to the dealership's $139 - seem to be quoting more hours to do work and not crediting what they're supposed to on diagnosis time or taking credit for screw ups."
0,"If our experience wasn't so bad, it would have made a great skit for late night comedy.  \n\nDrinks: First, we ordered a \""Glass\"" of Cabernet and a \""Glass\"" of Merlot. About 15 minutes later, the over-the-top smiles aloof waitress brings a \""Bottle\"" of Cab and no Merlot. \n\nMeal: It took 50 minutes from placing the order to receive the meal. Other patrons complained to the manager about wait times. When food arrived, we had it bagged in order to make it to next destination.  When we got home, found that the chicken pasta meal did not include pasta, but instead had left over tomato salad and one of the side dishes was not there. \n\nProbably worst of all, the food lacked flavor and there are just too many other superior places to enjoy a great meal."
0,"The Wife and I decided to give Which Wich a try since we were driving past and really like subs. We'll keep driving next time.\n\nOverview (copied from their website): \""Guests use red Sharpies\u00ae to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. They select a sandwich from one of 10 categories, then choose the type of bread, size, cheese, spreads, and vegetables. The sandwiches are prepared to guests' exact specifications and delivered in personalized sandwich bags. After they've enjoyed their wiches, guests are encouraged to draw on their bags with the same red Sharpies and hang their 'artwork' on the community wall.\""\n\nAt first, this seemed like a cool concept, but we were quickly frustrated by the fact that, having just spent time deciding what we wanted to eat and marking that info on the bags, we then had to stand at the counter while an employee inputted each of our orders -- item by item -- into the system. It would have been much faster for us to just place our order at the counter in the first place, rather than repeating the process twice.\n\nWe waited nearly five minutes for our sandwiches, even though there was no line in the place. While I understand that time and care must be put into making sandwiches, I've been spoiled by places like Jimmy Johns and Potbelly where sandwiches are made quickly and taste great.\n\nWhich brings me to the taste of the sandwiches. Meh. I've experienced better. The bread was, at best, forgettable (the Wife hated it). The meat (pastrami) was overly salty, and the sauces lackluster.\n\nOverall, to the question of \""Which Wich?\"" I reply, \""Pretty much anyone else's!\"""
1,"Created by the founder of Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe is like a more upscale European version of it's former self. Open 24 hours, it's a great place to sober up after the wild night.\n\nIt's 4am and we're all hungry. Us being Lucy Y., David G., Sarah A., and myself. Having been here before, I recommended coming here for some early morning grub. We encountered some half naked drunk dudes standing around the restroom outside the restaurant. Good stuff!\n\nWe were promptly seated and I was craving breakfast. Ordered the Smoked Salmon with onions and scrambled eggs, it came with hash browns on the side. Simple and delicate at the same time. Contrast of smoked salmon and eggs together created a good plate overall. Filling enough for bedtime.  \n\nPricier than most 24 joints in the hotels, but the food and service is better also. Keep in mind only the late night menu is available after a certain time."
0,"We waited for about 30 minutes which was expected from the reviews on yelp. We got seated at the counter and ordered, small fried rice, small pork belly rice, gyoza, shoyu ramen & tonkotsu shoyu ramen. \nThe gyoza was flavorful and good! \nThe pork belly bowl was ok... But the fried rice and ramen was a complete disappointment! The soup is nothing but BLAND!!!!! :( no richness at all..\nWill defiantly not be back"
1,"what to order: farm burger, chicken wings, truffle fries\ntip: waiting isn't so bad with the texting system, go drink & gamble!\n\nwent with 4 of my friends on a Saturday afternoon after dayclub. I like the way their seating is set up, you tell the hostess how many, they quote you a time & they send you a text when the table is ready. we were sat within 30min! \n\nwe ordered: jalape\u00f1o poppers, chicken wings, truffle fries and the farm burger. \n\nthe chicken wings were surprisingly really good!! I liked them better than the jalape\u00f1o poppers, which were a little too mushy and I didn't like the sauce. I really liked the truffle fries too!\n\nthe farm burger was really good but I wished they had a side or the option of lettuce, onion and tomatoes.. I was too full to ask. the burger was too heavy on the protein side, it was lacking that fresh taste you get from the vegetables and ketchup.\n\nI would definitely come back and try other burgers, the burger party meat was so juicy!"
1,"I HIGHLY recommend Uptown Bridal for anyone searching for their perfect wedding dress. The staff is really really friendly and helpful. They're all very knowledgeable about the designers and styles they carry. Ali was the one that helped me, and was really patient with me in trying to find my dress - there were two that I couldn't decide between, and she helped me get dressed in them multiple times to compare.\n\nAlso, the day of my appointment, there was a parade going on on the main street out front, so they actually called me up the day before to give me a heads up and give me directions to go the back-way - really impressed me before I even went in. \n\nI went to two other boutiques, but there was something missing from the experience at those two places. One had great dresses but not-so-great service. The other was lacking on both the dresses and the customer service.\n\nSo I was happy when they fit me in to come back in on a Saturday evening right before closing so I could have one last look. My girl was busy, so the owner of the store actually made room for me and helped me try on the dresses - talk about customer service. I ended up finding the perfect dress and am so excited to go back in for my fitting.\n\nAgain...HIGHLY recommend them to anyone shopping for wedding dresses."
1,"I really like this place! The shrimp burrito was quite good, it unexpectedly bit me back, but a few swigs of water took care of that. Other people in the party liked theirs. One remark I can recall is that the burritos were filling. The owner (or I think it was) was very accommodating to our special requests, and explained the menu to us newbies. They take great care in preparing their food and I look forward to trying them for breakfast one of these days."
0,Beware of this gym!!! I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money. I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account. I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense.
0,"This place is always packed in the evening and we had to go check it out. I was a little afraid honestly while waiting seeing so many reviews of just 1 star. The service could use some work, but they seemed extremely busy. There was several table tops of 6+ coming in while we were waiting to be seated on a Saturday Night. One table top of 11 came in as well while we were waiting.  \n\nI don't think they are very expensive compared to Macayo's in the area. The one good thing they do have is the 48oz Margarita's for 2. They definitely don't skip the the alcohol, and their Margarita's are pretty cheap. You can get a 48oz (depending on the style) for at least 11$ which is crazy! I asked if they will serve a 48oz margarita for two for one, and they said they would. I think this could be dangerous for margarita lovers.. \n\nI had their mexican abodabba pizza and it was very good I thought. My wife had their chimmy, and I wasnt a fan of it. I think its just OK in the land of mexican food out there, but their drinks definately stand out on their own."
0,"It was nice to get in for free but i do not recommend this place! I recently went to Studio 54 in spite of hearing bad reviews because girls can get in for free. The Dj played old music; the guys were creepy, hitting on every single girl; majority of people aren't dressed up; the dance floor is so small that people can't dance; the bar is so packed, it takes 20 minutes to get a drink. Leave this club as your last resort and do not expect much! Do not recommend!"
0,"Great look from the street. Cool interior. Good looking menu content. \n\nService: 3/5 (slow and understaffed - seems more to be a kitchen issue)\n\nCleanliness: 4/5 (too many flies)\n\nFood: Ordered a Hillbilly Highrise. sounds good. ordered a large oj ($5) and side of bacon. The bacon would be great if it was at minimum \""warm\""  obviously precooked, left under a heatlamp (must be broken). It is thick cut which is great but when cold you taste and feel the lard coat your tongue and roof of mouth. Other bacon for peeps at table was same (cold and lard(y)).  As for the main plate. I asked for crispy hashbrowns (these are set on bottom then stacked with beef patties, eggs and sausage gravy.\n\nHave you ever had hashbrowns that tasted kinda like fish? it's old oil! they were not crispy either. As for the patties, tasted freezer burned and they were chewy, not chewy like dry thanksgiving turkey, but chewy like bouncy in your mouth.  As a whole, not good. The plate was garnished with pineapple (bruised and soft), the melons, same. obviously old, cut tooooo soon and stored (cold, hot, cold, hot) it breaksdown!\n\nThe server was nice and asked if I would like to order something else, I did look at the menu again, but realizing we waited 35+ minutes for that order, I just could not do it again.\n\nSorry, but I won't be squeezing again."
0,Overpriced and not even very good. They were ok when I didn't know of better sushi options in Phoenix.
1,"We just checked into this hotel, and it's beautiful!  The front desk staff were so nice and friendly.  We're staying in an Executive Suite, so we expect niceness, but it's more than expected.  When we entered our room, our fireplace was already turned on for us - so was the music.  I'm going to enjoy staying here so much---I'm so spoiled!!!"

1,"Best Airports to be drunk in\n1) Narita/Tokyo- Come on, it's made of glass and you can ride the monorail for about 3 hours and everyone's too polite to tell you to get off.\n2) Chicago O'Hare- There's a mother f.ing neon tunnel (put on some The Dark Side of the Moon in that and you'd be bumped up a spot)\n3) McCarran- Las Vegas. You just spent 12 hours in Vegas. It's inevitable, how can you not be drunk? The stone Lizard and Snake make great props and the mesmerizing slot machines make you forget you're waiting for a flight back home while the rest of your friends are still tanning at the pool. Bitches.\n\nLook a quarter! Deposit. Pull. \nCherry, Cherry! Cherry!!!.....Lemon  =(\n Oh fuck. Well at least it's time to board."
0,"Cox sucks. A year ago when I moved into my new place I tried to get internet only. They gave me such a hard time, then I ended up with an Internet and tv package that I didn't really want. Fast forward a year later and my usual bill is twice what it was. Turns out they jacked up the prices, no surprise. \n\nSo I call and cancel the tv service that I never wanted in the first place. Now I have to wait in line at this store just to drop off the receiver. But no, you can't just drop off the receiver, you have to wait for receipt from an agent. And that's where I've been for the past 20 minutes, with 10+ people ahead of me."
1,"It is almost impossible to mess this show up and the Mandalay Bay show did impress. Admittedly, the New York show is hard to match so my perception is heavily biased against the LV production.\n\nThe show's production quality was good, again, a notch below the NY production, but still impressive. The acting seemed a bit flat during the first Act but certainly picked up during the second Act. It may have been an off night or a slow start. I do not want to undermine the efforts of the talent but that was my impression. Notably, the performances of Kissy Simmons and Buyi Zama (Nala and Rafiki) filled the theater with beauty and strength. They, individually, made the show worthwhile. I still laughed and became emotional during the show, so the cast did create an engaging show.\n\nI would not deem this show a reason to visit Vegas but if you are there, I would check it out. The theater is not huge so there are great seats to be had for good prices."
0,"I took my Playstation 3 here after the laser stopped reading any of the blu-ray discs. When I got it back the PS3 could read the blu-ray, but the power button was indented into the PS3 case. I took it back to them and they said it wasn't them and they didn't do it, however, I haven't touched it since I got it from them. They wanted a receipt to prove that I went there to get it fixed before. They had saved their own copy of the receipt, but when the guy took out the receipts he had he looked through the first few then went on to the next set, not making sure to check all of the receipts. I found my receipt later, and gave it to them, then the guy told me he would replace it and said it would be ready in a few days. When I picked it up again, they didn't charge me anything for it, but after playing a blu-ray, a few days after, the PS3 wouldn't accept blu-rays anymore. I decided I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to get them to fix it again, so I won't come back here and I'll just save the $120 they would charge and put it towards a new system."
0,"The theaters are clean, the selection of movies and snacks are usually pretty good.\n\nThe low rating is due to their inability to maintain the audio equipment to have 'assisted hearing devices'.  I suspect that they just don't ever bother to fix them, and it's kind of disgusting because it shows a complete lack of respect and courtesy toward handicapped patrons.  I'd be a little more tolerant if it wasn't the third time it happened.  (Shame on me for thinking things would be fixed, after we boycotted for a year or so...)\n\nWhen told that their equipment isn't working, they just shrug.  A refund was halfheartedly offered after three sets of new equipment (which I'm pretty sure they knew wouldn't work.) but I would've had to leave immediately and my husband was enjoying the movie.\n\nTo contrast, a similar situation happened at the Waterworks Cinema (which is old fashioned by comparison).  When informed that the assisted hearing device wasn't working, the manager was profusely apologetic, insisted on giving us 2 passes that not only were for free admission but any concessions we wanted.  And, oh yeah?  The problem was fixed the next time we returned."
1,Dropped my iPhone 5c last night and broke the glass :( but took my phone here to get it repaired and it only took 30mins!! Awesome place and great prices !
1,Great Italian food. Great Sinatra music playing all night. Everything was excellent from service to desert. Try out the cigar room in the back.
1,"\""You can whip our cream, but you can't beat our cheese!\""\n\nNice tagline, huh?\n\nI thought so... and I also think that Crow's Dairy Farmstead Goat Cheese (made from 100% fresh milk produced by Nubian dairy goats) is pretty fantastic.\n\nI've purchased both the regular goat cheese and the jalape\u00f1o flavor from the Old Town Farmers Market, and was extremely pleased... I hope to try the raspberry flavor next time!  (So far, I've enjoyed this melt-in-your-mouth treat in salads and on crackers and I'm sure there are plenty more ways to utilize it which I will be exploring soon.)\n\nI see on their website that \""their aim is to provide a quality product that the consumer can enjoy in a local restaurant, buy at a farmer's market or come to the farm to purchase. Plans are for the farm to be open for public sales in the spring of 2010.\""  Until then, you can find Crow's Dairy cheeses at farmers markets all around the Valley as well as at BLT Steakhouse, Chelsea's Kitchen, Calistro California Bistro, and Cheuvront Restaurant and Wine Bar.\n\nTry it... and thank me later!"
0,"I agree with all the other reviews. This place is horrible. The office employees are not very bright. It took a month and a half after filling out the application to know if we were approved or not, and we didn't find out until the day before our move in date! And that was with constant calling and going down to the office. They are extremely unorganized, and they are very polite and friendly, until you move in. Then they act like they can't be bothered with you or your problems. They can't keep track of anything, it takes constant calling to make sure they are on top of your requests. I would not refer this apartment complex to ANYONE."
1,Great gym. I loved Becky's Zumba classes and the Functional Fitness 6am classes. What really made it worth it was Cheri's helpfulness in regards to membership issues.
1,"We went out on a Sunday night just for dinner and to walk around the lake and village for a bit. We had 3 people and assumed it would be a little busy in the late afternoon early evening but oh my was it ever DESERTED. We parked in the Village parking garage and just saw a couple other car and walked through a passage to the lower village shopping area and it was almost scary/embarresing how empty it was. Walking through the main shopping area we thought we were in the twilight zone and would be attacked by zombies at any moment. We ate at the Black Pepper Grill which we had the ask the one guy if they were open and sat at a table in a restaurant where we were one of two total parties. Awesome food and service but just plain creepy with no people around especially at prime dinner time on a weekend. We walked over to the newly opened Ravella and it was warm and comfortable and had a great front bar that was had surprisingly cheap prices, but again just a random person walking through the hotel lobby. I really hope Lake Las Vegas comes back cause it has so much to offer...Until then I am going to film a episode of \""Life After People\"" on the property"
0,"In June of 2014 I brought my Luminox watch to Amy's for service. The seal on the watch had failed and water had gotten into the cavity. After a month, I received the watch back. The repair fee was $90.00. Once I had worn the watch for a couple hours the hands in the watch would move freely and rotate around like they were not tightened. I brought it back, and about 3 weeks later I got it back. Same issue happened again, as described above, with the same outcome not once, not twice, but three times. When I returned to pick up my watch the forth time, the owner informed me that they replaced the watch hands with generic parts. These watch hands look nothing like the originals. This was a $600.00 watch! Upon further inspection the watch hands were actually dirty on the green part that glows in the dark, and the back of the watch was put back on, upside down. After speaking with the owner at length he offered to \""take the watch hands out and give me the watch back\"". He also noted that I \""did not pay a dime for the new watch hands\"". He also admitted he had no way of getting the original parts. Don't you think you should tell your customer that?! I left the store and promptly filed a claim with my credit card company. I contacted Luminox directly, $65 to fix the watch from the manufacturer with the right parts! Lesson learned. DO NOT use Amy's Jewelry for any type of watch repair."
1,Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.

0,"I don't even want to waste a lot of time talking about how bad this place is...I'll try and sum it up. \n\n*Dining room was dirty, uncomfortable and hot. \n\n*Service was lacking. 10 min for the first greet. 20 min to order. 30 min for food. Every chance the server had he would go an do his side-work while eating...right in front of us. \n\n*Found a water glass at the table with lipstick. When we asked for a new one the server simply pulled one of the table new to us. NOTE: server man handled the glass at the top...where people put their lips! \n\nFood: Blah. Nothing exciting to report.  Maybe it's because I could get past the server putting his hands all over my glass.  Yikes. \n\nI wanted to like this place..."

0,This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.
0,Poor attempt at nachos. Chips (half plate) cheese n onions for 8 bucks? Sad at best...
1,"Oh good. Another great eggs benny place. My waistline really needed that one... Edinburgh, would you quit it with the amazing brunch options? \n\nNo. Don't. Please don't. \n\nYet another wonderful Elite suggested find, this time courtesy of the lovely Caz H. This tiny little place packs a surprising punch. It's all of six tables - which you will acutely feel on the weekend while you table scavenge with the ten other people looking to feed themselves. Expect to be squeezed in, table poached or on the rare occasion, exiled to the outside seats if you venture here on a weekend.\n\nWhy? Because you've made an excellent decision - they serve up a delightful breakfast. All. Freaking. Day.\n\nBecause i'm addicted, I had to go with a benny option, though the waffles here look pretty killer as well. Opted for a Eggs Royale (smoked salmon benny) and it was darn tasty. Alongside not one, but two coffees (you know it's good when this rare coffee consumer orders a second), it was a lovely little brunch for a decent price.\n\nI had been in here once previously for a smoothie. Honestly, they aren't my favourite but I come from the land of smack-you-in-the-face-green-health-smoothies, so it was just too sweet for my likely. That being said, in the city, they're second only to Hula in this category. If you are a far less picky guy/gal and like a sweet fruit drink - this is likely a good option.\n\nAll in all, another lovely little find for my Sunday afternoons. Thanks Caz!"
1,"I have never seen a Cirque de Soleil Show before, nor any show in Vegas, for that matter. I really enjoyed it. The musicians were top-notch, the dancers were enegetic and exciting, the acrobats were breathtaking. We had a wonderful time. Of course, our tickets were free, so that makes it all that much better!"
1,"I give this a five star only because for what it is, it's BANGIN. I got so,etching called the farmers meal, or something like that. It was MASSIVE. When you order a pancake here they give you one the size of three, and it's actually delicious. They have wonderful crispy home fries. It was just a great and filling meal. So I give it a five star. They cooked one hell of a breakfast."
1,"Wow...considering the mixed reviews here, I had to chime in as well.\n\nI was greeted by a very friendly hostess who offered to seat me, or redirect me to the bar, if I preferred.  My choice should be obvious.\n\nThe bartender was great.  Very engaging, made some good drink specials, and chatted the whole time.\n\nI had the inferno burger, which I thought was delicious.  A spicy burger that is ACTUALLY spicy!  Finally!  I'm sooooo bored with all the lame attempts to appease the masses by marketing a spicy dish that disappoints on the Scoville scale.  (I think I've mentioned that I have to plead with my Thai food servers that I really mean 10....maybe even 11)\n\nOur group also shared some onion rings, fried pickles, and fried mac & cheese.  I'm not a fan of mac & cheese anyway, so I won't elaborate on that one, but the onion rings were top notch.  Great crisp, fresh sweet onions, and good dipping sauce.  The fried pickles were amazing!  I love that they use full length sandwich slices and batter fry them.  I would just order those next time.\n\nI think this is a good little spot.  I'll return there for lunch or happy hour for sure."
0,Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them.
1,"My daughter and I had food delivered yesterday. O my goodness everything we ordered came hot and freshly prepared. My favorite was the Crab Puffs and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. My daughter loved her Fried Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portions were big enough that we shared with my 2 boys when they got home. I had the Combination Dinner, it was a lot of food. My daughter had Chicken, Rice, and Shrimp. Will definitely be ordering front them again. Also they were very friendly. Even answered questions we had about a different dish."
0,"I was excited a new independent restaurant opened around the corner from my house. \n\nUpon being seated at Bootleggers, my arm stuck to the table. It was difficult to get anyone's attention to come wipe the table. https://www.yelp.com/biz/bootleggers-food-and-drink-phoenix\n\nWe ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer, which was very tasty, yet a very small portion for $10, for 10 marble sized shrimp. \n\nOur dinner was comprised of Beef Brisket, Turkey Leg and Cottage Fries.\nThe cottage fries were horrible. They tasted like they were a cheap brand, frozen from a bag. In fact, I buy frozen Ore-Ida fries that are far superior. These were below school lunch grade. I suggest the Crispy Ore-Ida Crinkle Cuts. They are fantastic. \n\nThe Beef Brisket was unlike any I've ever eaten before, and I would never eat this one again. It was cut horizontally, against the grain of the top of brisket. It was one 1/2 inch slice. It looked more like an elongated piece of liver. It was very dry and barely tasted like brisket due to the cut and thickness. The turkey leg was very small, maybe 7\"" long and was also quite dry.  I'm no chef, but I can make far superior turkey, brisket and Ore-Ida fries at home. \n\nIt seemed that the kitchen was very backed up. All the tables were full and everyone was waiting for their food, as well as the servers were waiting and starring into the kitchen.  It seemed that the kitchen was struggling with preparing food for the bar buffet, and dinner service.  After the bar buffet was replenished, table service began to flow. \n\nOur server was friendly, yet very inattentive. I had to wave my drink several times to get the servers attention for a refill, and then when it came it wasn't what I was drinking.  I gave up on trying to have it corrected. The servers passed quickly through the tables without looking or acknowledging their tables. \n\nThe table next to us had issues with their service and getting their full order served as we exchanged exasperated glances. It wasn't until after they were ready to leave that the last dish was finally brought to their table. \n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. If only I could get the servers attention to bring my check.  Finally the server had brought out about five checks, picked them all up and rang them all out slowly at the same time. \n\nI wish Bootleggers all the luck in the world and hope they can make it, and then make it better."
1,"I have to give credit to my husband on this one.  We finally got better insurance coverage so I told my husband we needed to switch dentist.  He was in need of a cleaning before the end of the year, so I told him to find someone as soon as possible.  This was a week ago.  I was impressed that he found this office and he even found a spot for me the same day.  The front office was really easy to deal with and my hygienist Deann was very nice and professional.  The doctor came to do the check up and told me that if there was an emergency, he is the one answering the phone, so no answering service to deal with.  That is awesome.  Although I hope I don't have any emergencies."
1,"This has always been my go-to spot whenever I felt the need to fulfill my craving for carne asada fries. Hands down, they will always be the best to me. Im sure there are other great options to be had, but you'd have to know where to look. In my case, it's a quick drive for a quick fix. Carne asada isn't my only favorite but the Nevada burrito will give you such a satisfying bite, it'll have you coming back in no time! It doesn't get better then your carne asada fries wrapped in a tortilla, so you can enjoy the mouthwatering goodness as a whole. There food is definitely enough to satisfy you, and your friend."
0,"So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.\n\nI came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...\n\nThey let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \""old\"" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.\n\nI realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.\n\nThe Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.\n\nNot going back to Buca, in any city.\n\nAside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back."
0,"Only in Vegas could you make reservations at a place that threatens to charge you $50 per person if you don't show up to be seated at a plastic folding table.\n\nThe service was fine. A little slow but they tend to drag their feet a bit when they're charging you a whole lot for not much substance, it's makes you feel like you're getting more out of the experience I guess.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and watched him struggle through the menu before saying he'd have to ask the chef, which I don't think he ever did because we never got an answer.\n\nEveryone in our party said they liked their meal but no one liked it enough to finish everything on their plate which says something.\n\nTheir prices are fairly astronomical for what you get and I believe that they try to cover up what is basic food with a fancier name. Roasted Corn Soup = one of the cartons of soup from Trader Joe's, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos = raw tuna chunks with a side of commercial grade tortilla chips, Cornmeal Crusted Chili Relleno = big jalapeno popper, Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak = Chili's summer special.\n\nI'm sure there are good aspects of this place, we just didn't see them. \n\nI guess everything in Vegas is a gamble."
0,"My family have been loyal customers of Wynn for many many years. It's been our favorite hotel until today.\n\nThe customer service at wynn lacks professionalism. I was thoroughly disappointed at how a manager handles a mistake that was made by an employee checking us in. Upon check in, my card was double charged for the resort fee. The next day when I approached the checkin desk again to voice my concern, the manager I spoke to was extremely arrogant  and insisted they corrected the mistake so that's all. His apology was insincere and he communicated with a stern face and acted like I was wasting his time, when it was his staffs mistake that's causing me extra trouble.\n\nI've stayed at plenty 5 star resorts and not once have I experienced such horrible customer service."
1,"Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!"
0,"If you Re there for beer, microbrews and such, this is the place for you.  However, if you are looking for a good chili dog, try someplace else.  While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks."
1,Very delicious food here
1,Love my gym!!! Working out!!!
0,"We came here to watch the playoffs. I made a reservation since I knew it was going to be busy. I knew everyone will be looking for a table to watch the games. The host told me not to worry and that my table will be ready. When I got there, I didn't get my table and we had to wait for the upstairs to open. This bar was not ready to host any big games. The bartender that served my margarita didn't make it right. So easy to mess up a margarita..  Food was ok. Regular bar food. They were not very accommodating especially when you have reservations. The hostess just sat everyone that walked in. She had no clue about playoffs Sunday. I should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino. Atleast they give out free drinks!"
1,"This my one of my favorite Spas.  I went years ago when it was called Oasis and it was better then... it was opened 24 hours.  However, I do realize that they have changed quite a bit since my first visit years ago.  \n\nThey offer you everything that you need, a locker w/ a robe, slippers, towels, iced water, fruit drinks, teas, fresh fruit, snacks, lotion, hair necessities (gel, comb, brush, curling iron, blow drier, hair spray), deodorant, razors, mouthwash, cotton swabs - the works.\n\nIt is immaculately clean and I love that they keep the place picked up (towels etc.) really nicely without being in my personal space.\n\nI have had massages and a facial there. One of them was way under average.  I was told that the gentleman was blind.  I would have thought it would have been even better after hearing that.  You know, more attuned to the feel of a persons body needs through touch.\n\nTheir staff was very professional and friendly and very attentive while giving my space to relax and enjoy the space.\n\nThey have their own brand of body wash, shampoo and conditioner called Nurture.  I did like the Oasis' style better because each of the showers had a different set of fragrances in them and I think over the course of 4 days I used almost all of them - Lavender Citrus, Ocean Breeze, Cucumber and on and on.\n\nI do wish they would put the chaise lounges back next to the jacuzzi they were nice to relax on.\n\nI really look forward to going here each time I go to Las Vegas.  Even when I am not staying at the Luxor I go here for some me time at least once per trip. \n\nSee You There!"
0,"The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a \""loaner\"" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be a longer wait. Oh yea they only take cash and don't tell you until your car is already in their position. They will charge you just as much as a legit body ran properly so don't waist your time."
1,"quality selection, great people, good stuff!\n\nneeded a packer brisket to smoke...not only was this one of the only places in town that carried it, but they had a selection of nicely marbled, good looking stuff. despite being close to closing time, i never felt rushed while looking over the cuts to get the 'perfect' one.\n\nother meats looked great as well...will be picking up some lamb shoulder there tonight (only place i called as i knew they would have it), as well as any of my other carnivore treats in the future."

0,"I am so surprised at the good reviews for this dental practice! My husband and I had the worst experiences. I have never written a bad review, but would like to stop someone from this mistake.\n\nWe both went in for yearly basic cleanings. My husband's appointment was a day before mine. At 6 at night they tried to talk him into a root canal that night! He had not had any pain mind you. He called me and I said it was fishy they were trying to talk him into it that night. He said no to that but they did talk him into a deep cleaning. He did half that night and was supposed to do the other half the next day when I went in as well.\nFor my appointment, they took tons of X-rays then sat me in the chair. The doc came in and went over all the procedures they thought I should have. My 2 remaining wisdom teeth pulled, five cavity fills and a deep cleaning. I consider my teeth in very good shape and have had no pain whatsoever. As they were going over their recommendations I noticed on the computer screen everything had \""patient accepts\"" next to it. I said I did not want anything except the basic cleaning that was covered 100% by my full dental insurance. They then went on to lie to me and say that since I \""needed\"" deep cleaning that my insurance would not pay for a basic cleaning. I could not believe it. I walked out with nothing and called my insurance company. They said they've never heard of that and that I am fully covered for one basic cleaning a year and they'd never deny that. I was shocked. \nI could go on and on but the short of it is that we ended up with a $400 bill for my husbands deep cleaning AFTER insurance paid another $400 hundred dollars!!\nThey are major scam artists! They take your electronic signature and transpose it onto receipts! Never sign anything electronically while lying in the chair getting the procedure done as they had my husband do!\nWe went to AT Stills since then and the professors told my husband they had even botched his deep cleaning! \nPlease re-think choosing Tempe Modern Dentistry!"
1,"OK, so living in Las Vegas has taken some getting used to.  Especially the whole strip mall thing, which means lack of character to the shopping areas.  \n\nSo imagine my surprise when looking for a place to have dinner with out of town friends, that we pulled into a parking spot in front of Pin Kaow and walked through the doors and were transported into a beautifully elegant, dining experience.\n\nNot only is the restaurant beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive, dressed in Thai attire.  And the food... OH!  The food.  It's wonderfully delicious!  My party and I had assorted curries and appetizers and nothing disappointed.  My San Diego friend, who is very finicky, LOVED his duck curry and had it again when we returned 3 months later.\n\nThis is definitely a little ray of sunshine in the land of strip malls."
1,"Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.\n\nEach regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc."
0,"Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale.

They told us we needed a  new timing belt and a whole bunch of other stuff we knew was a load of crap b/c we had literally just had the timing belt and water pump replaced a few months ago.  Liars!  Had the car towed to our regular guy (inconvenient, because he's far away) but not after an $89 fee just to have them look at it (and give us bogus info).  Wanna know what the problem really was?  A radiator hose that had come off.  C'mon Fletcher's, that's LOW."

0,"The entire staff at this office is completely incompetent. I went here in Jan 2012, and after waiting AN HOUR past my appointment time, I was finally taken back to the exam room. I had been experiencing a sharp ear pain and all I wanted was some medicated ear drops.... Dr Mendelson prescribed me NASAL SPRAY. In addition they made me do a hearing test which came back normal (which btw that lady treated me like I was 5 years old and special needs). I think the staff should take the hearing test themselves because THEY DON'T LISTEN to anything their patients tell them. I left the office in tears."
0,"I had read previous reviews from yelpers and took there advice and called 15 minutes prior to my arrival. When I got there, they still hadn't put the pizza in the oven.

The nine orders of people here are getting uptight about this.  I'm just seeing people walking in and out of this place.\nWhere is the management of this establishment? Although this is a franchise, there should be some type of responsibility for the bad service they provide. The corporate office should investigate what kind of people are running this franchise..\nIt gives Little Skeezers a bad name."

1,"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.  \n\nThe Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  \n\nThey even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.\n\nI usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.\n\nTime and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!"
0,"This is literally the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Shame it won't allow me to give them zero stars. My cable doesn't work half the time. With my cable internet, I need help with the wireless because the password printed on the box won't allow my other services to connect. They promised me they'd help me if I needed it. My neighbors signal strength is twice as strong as mine and mine is the box sitting right in the same room. And to ice the cake, I've been calling for three days and still have been unable to get a human being on the line. Disgusting. Absolutely insulting. As soon as I get in touch with someone, I'm canceling this service. They can come get this cable box and modem/router out of my house. I cannot believe for what they charge us they cannot pay a human customer representative or at least have a service where a person calls you back in the order your call was received. I don't need Cox anymore at all, with Hulu, Netflix, amazon Prime, etc, so they can kiss off!"

1,Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!
1,"Delicious tapas, but the paella needed some work.\n\nI came here last year with some girlfriends and we had a delicious dinner of a variety of tapas. Because of my past dining experience, I made another reservation for my birthday dinner this past weekend. \n\nAs I remembered, the tapas were delicious. We had the albondigas, ahi tempura, and the yellowtail with jalapeno. All were super flavorful and tasty. We also ordered the seafood paella and added shrimp. For a $60 dish, I expect to be blown away. But, the paella was really al dente - almost crunchy. The seafood was good, but not great. About half the mussels didn't open up either, so I was sure to discard them. \n\nI would definitely go back again for tapas, but I'm steering clear of the paellas."
0,"I'm a native San Franciscan, so of  course I've been to Crustacean and Thanh Long in San Francisco. Both restaurants are to die for, but this location's food is nothing like either one. I went to Vegas about 3 years ago for a friend's birthday, so of course we had to check out the place. We ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles. The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab. Plus it was a tad bit more expensive. The location was nice, though. We decided to order a bottle of wine and just made the best out of the evening."
0,"Pros:\nWell, at least we have a bus.\n\nCons:\nLong waits inbetween buses/infrequent service.\nRidiculous fare prices that seem to go up every 2 months. \nHORRIFIC routing.\nGives priority to The Strip/tourists.(Well isn't that surprising?)\nAssumes everyone who lives on the far north, west and south sides has a car.\nThe monorail failed, so now they're using bus riders as a scapegoat by raising the bus fare.\n\nI hate Las Vegas public transportation. It's truly, utterly ridiculous. I don't think i'm ever going to get over how I have to take 3 buses to get to CSN on Charleston just because they refuse to place a bus on the major street nearest to where I live."
0,"You know a burger is bad when you take a bite and think to yourself, \""Wow. I've had hospital food better than this. In fact, I've had vending machine hamburgers better than this.\"" I'm not exaggerating. \n\nWe wanted a quick, simple pub grub meal for our last dinner in Montreal since we have to be up early in the AM. Since La Cage Aux Sports is right across from our apartment rental, it seemed to fit the bill. \n\nWe should have known when we walked in on a Friday night at and the place was COMPLETELY empty, save for two middle aged guys holding up the bar. Husband and I chose a seat at the other end of the bar, and upon sitting down noticed that most of the bar was dirty with crumbs and wrappers. I'm not sure why the bar would be so filthy considering there was nobody in it, but... okay. \n\nI ordered the Prime Rib burger. The burger had many flaws, but the most grievous sin was that it was burnt. Seriously burnt black. It tasted just like the kind of burger you'd get in a vending machine: the bun was your typical super-soft wonderbread kind, and the meat was standard factory-issue. I don't know why they would call it a Prime Rib burger when the beef had none of the juiciness or flavor of prime rib. It tasted more like the burgers you get in the frozen food section in a bag of 10 patties. I'm not above digging a Costco backyard burger, but burning it into a lump of charcoal is unforgiveable. I ate three bites, which is amazing for a girl who can eat practically anything. \n\nMy husband ordered the Hot Chicken Sandwich, which were two pieces of thickly sliced white bread (also of the spongy wonderbread variety) with chunks of chicken in between. The sandwich was then covered in gravy and then topped with peas. The bread-chicken-gravy monstrosity itself was barely warm, but even worse, the peas were cold and mushy. So. Very. Gross.\n\nDespite these huge shortcomings, the bartender/waitress was really nice (though mostly absent). Being tourists, we didn't have the guts to send the food back, so we just left our entrees mostly uneaten and hightailed it outta there after finishing our drinks. \n\nDinner ended up being cookies and chips from the Couche-Tard a couple of blocks away. Sad to end our great Montreal culinary tour on a bad note, but all the other awesome meals we've had here made up for this giant dud."
1,I've been coming here over a year now and they are fabulous. They are very clean and even if theirs a line of people the wait is never long. Always pleasant and polite.
0,"wow. this is the worst place I ever order food from. 1st the food came cold, & when spoke to the manager Joey he said - WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST,  then he insulted me, & was as unprofessional as a manager could be. He thinks making excusing & insulting people is part of saying sorry. I would tell everybody do not order from this place, as long as this guy is in charge. He is a joke of a mamager."
0,"Very subpar in every aspect.  I'd like to give it one-star but I'm strangely in a generous mood today.\n\nHad the ham and cheese crepe.  The crepe is overly sweet; very stingy on the fillings; a paper-thin sheet of ham and some sort of runny, bland tasteless cheese.\n\nThe coffee tasted as if it had been sitting in the thermos since early morning-which it probably was.\n\nOverall not good and expensive-$16.  Granted it is Montreal and it is on a prime location.  Still $16 is in no way justified for the lousy crepe."
1,"Performance art with amplified tuned percussion, humor, audience participation, and yes, toilet paper.\n\nThis was a great event, a private showing of BMG sponsored by my company.

Very entertaining!"
0,"I was sort of reluctant to write a bad review because Velvet is so cute and convenient -- I really, really wanted to like it. But I felt compelled to write a review because my eyebrow wax at Velvet was the worst I've ever gotten -- and I have huge eyebrows so I've gotten loads of eyebrow waxes. \n\nTo be fair, I've had a problem with skin being torn off in the past. I usually treat it like no big deal because it happens relatively frequently and it's usually just a thin patch right under my eye. So I'm aware that it's a possibility whenever I get a wax, and I'm usually pretty cool about it. But what happened at Velvet was just unacceptable. \n\nThe wax took off the top layer of skin under one eye, and half the skin under another. The wax was apparently down bizarrely close to my eye -- way beyond where I've ever had eyebrow hair. It hurt like hell and I've had to wear my thick-rimmed glasses for days so that nobody will be suspicious. It's still red and I'm terrified it'll scar. \n\nBasically my point is this: if you have sensitive brows or if you've had a problem with skin being torn off in the past, I just wouldn't go here."
0,"Is it possible to rate an establishment with less than 1 star? The security team here is a joke. I came in with a pocket knife (I am a woman mind you) only to have it confiscated at the door. This wasn't too much to ask as I understand the need for a safe environment. I do want to make it known that I carry my pocket knife everywhere and have never had it confiscated at any of the bars on Fremont. I forgot to get it back that night but came back the next day to grab it. \n\nThe only person that was available to talk was the barista that worked the counter at the coffee shop. She informed me that the knife was potbelly locked away in a safe because she couldn't find it. She took down my information and told me she would call once my knife was found. She called me with in a few hours to let me know my knife was there and safe. I was unable to come on Saturday night because I had to work. I came back on Sunday and Monday during the day and found the establishment  closed on both of hose days. Because I work and go to school full time, tonight was the first day I could come back. \n\nI was greeted by security and waited for about 15 minutes for the manager to come from upstairs to open the safe that my knife was supposedly kept in. After waiting for the manger for 15 minutes, the manager informs me that there was in fact no knife in the safe. This left me very confused. After gathering my thoughts and confusion, approached the manager with my question about the whereabouts of my pocket knife. After a few minutes the director of security became involved. The director went on to ask me why they would even bother putting someone's knife in safe to begin with. I was just as confused about that as he was. I went on to ask him why several people would tell me that my property was put in a safe and why the where about of my property we're know one day and unknown the next. I also asked his if he was concerned about his employees taking property from customers, specifically weapons. \n\nBoth gentlemen were unconcerned with the fact that a weapon was missing and that a customer was very unhappy with losing property at their establishment. Both of these gentlemen need to be taught a few lessons on how to talk and deal with customers. I am very upset and am looking into how I can get this resolved. This security team is very unprofessional in every way possible. I can get past the value of my knife, what's harder to get past is the unclear communication about the situation and the ignorance of the incompetence of their own company and team."

0,"I read the negative reviews and my exact thoughts were; \""Well, some people are jerks and nothing makes them happy. It probably isn't as bad as they say.\"" Wrong.  Save yourself some money, soak some cardboard in warm water, place it on a warm corn tortilla, and eat it.  It isn't that the food tastes bad.  It's that it doesn't taste like anything at all.  I got a taco platter with three different types of tacos, pork, chicken, and beef.  They all tasted exactly the same, like an empty, warm, corn tortilla.  The only reason I gave them two stars was for the excellent wait staff.  Doesn't make up for the flavorless food.  Wouldn't even feed the leftovers to a dog."

Plenty of antiques but also lots of western wears and other stuff. It's set up kind of like Black Lion, with lots of little cubicles from different sellers. Just row after row. I kept getting turned around. Of course my wife knew exactly where we were! They have a self serve popcorn machine at the front. Really good popcorn!

0,"My family and I have eaten here a few times.  We feel that the food is adequate and return every now and again for a change of atmosphere from our regular restaurants.\n\nLast night, we had a group in from out of town so thought we'd take them to Four Peaks.  We called ahead and spoke to a gentleman who told us that \""We are never busy on weekday afternoons during the summer\"" (Um, was he being sarcastic?  He sounded sincere...) and that \""There is a big parking lot that most people don't know about behind the restaurant and to the east.\""  He also said that reservations were not necessary because they were not busy, nor did they expect to be.\n\nWe were surprised when we arrived and the \""big parking lot\"" was actually very small and entirely occupied.  In fact, it was so cramped that it required driving backward for a significant amount of time to exit because there was no room to turn around.  The only parking we were able to find was probably 1/4 to 1/2 mile away down the street.  Since I am hugely pregnant and my sister has a small baby and it was 113 degrees outside, our family members dropped us off in front of Four Peaks while they went to park the car so that we would not have to walk in the heat.\n\nWhen we approached the hostess (who, by the way, is located outdoors), we had to wade through a decently-sized crowd (also waiting for tables).  We were told that \""until the majority of the party arrived, we could not put our name on the list.\""  In a normal restaurant, this would only seem fair because customers can sit or stand in an air conditioned building.  However, we were only 1 person short of having the majority of our party there and that person was parking the car.  The only reason he was not there yet was because this facility does not bother to provide its customers with a place to park their vehicles.  Having lived in the DC area for the last 6 years, I can say that this is to be expected in a big city but in Arizona, it is unacceptable to me.  Most every other business has to pay for/provide parking for their customers.  What makes Four Peaks so special?\n\nMy mom asked how long the wait would be.  \""We cannot tell you until the majority of your party is here.\""  Based on their silly little policy, I guess this would make sense.  She asked, \""If the person is here within 5 minutes, how long would the wait be?\""  We were told 25-30 minutes... which is far from what we were told when we called ahead.  Given, I understand it would have been impossible for the man we spoke with 30 minutes earlier to predict a massive influx of customers immediately before we arrived but at the same time, it does seem a little more than ironic that this would happen on this very day within 30 minutes of our telephone call.  I can only deduce that he was being dishonest.\n\nMy mom asked if we could wait somewhere with air conditioning since we were there with a pregnant person and a baby.  The hostess pointed to the bar area, which was not an option for us because we were there with two minors.  So, basically, we were given two options: stand outside in 113 degree weather and no shade with a pregnant lady and a baby for 25-30 minutes, or leave.  We chose to leave.\n\nUnfortunately, since parking was such a nightmare, it took us some time to reconnect with the person who drove as well as with the other two vehicles in our party that were just arriving.  It was a serious mess.  Had it not been so terribly hot, it would have just been inconvenient.  Factor in the heat and it became a health hazard.  \n\nA little customer service goes a long way.\n\nWe will not return."
1,"After playing eenie meenie minne mhhhoo, I weeded Butters over 5 other breakfast restaurant. It was a little whiles away, but I am sooo happy we chose it! Our server was Rafael. Cool, calm, collected, took our order, gave me some good highlights of the menu.\n\nFood came, literally within 10 minutes, and we were diggin' in. I ordered the chorizo omelette, chedder grits,  and it also came with pancakes. I never had chorizo omelette, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, it is a tad oily, but that is from the chorizo, however the veggies and egg balanced it out. CHEDDER GRITS delicious! My boyfriend stealth the rest. I cried. Pancakes, fluffy, buttery, melts in your mouth- probably the best set of pancakes ever. I ate it all. Then I cried. \n\nWe don't quite live in the area, so I am quite bummed that we'd will probably never have Butters again. It was a great choice for us, we enjoyed the service and food. Thanks Butters!"
0,If you're vegetarian this place is not for you.   The food sucks.  I can make better veg byrani and paneer tikka masala at home.   I gave one star for naan roti.  Least they got that correct. I would not come here again.   I was expecting good food similar to Shalimar in northern California.
1,"You've got to book with Liz!\n\nIf you have curly hair (or even not) she is the best in the burgh.  Nails it every time.  Love her personality and attention to detail.  I really feel like she listens to what I want but will tell me what she thinks, in a kind way. She's energetic, attentive, and just really knows hair.  \n\nHave been back multiple times and each time I leave happy: cut, color, and all.  Probably the first time i've actually stuck with a stylist.  Thanks Liz!"
0,"So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment."
0,"I went for the first time ever on Tuesday night with a group of friends. We sat down to order food and drinks. It wasn't a particularly busy night, and workers were just standing around and goofing off. We sat at a table and the server did not seem excited in anyway to take our order. I ordered a beer that took over 5 minutes to get to me. There is no reason it should have taken so long. She also was slow at getting us more drinks when we were low. Our food arrived pretty quickly though and we chowed down. We were ready to play some games after the beer and food, but we ended up waiting and waiting for the server to come by. She never did so we ended up having to grab a manager to get our tab. BOOOO, BAD SERVICE. I was not impressed.\n\nThe games were a lot of fun, and the happy hour is a tremendous deal. I'm severely disappointed the service wasn't better, otherwise this review would have been 4 stars."
1,"Yonaka is good VERY GOOD.  You need to come here for some delicious tasting eats.\n\nCome here for their Happy Hours.  There's a separate Happy Hour menu.  They run from 5 pm - 6:30 pm and 11 pm - 2 am.  I've only been to their 11 pm Happy Hours which doesn't get to busy.  Sit at the bar if it's available or at one of their tables though they both work out good.  \n\nA must have is their Crispy Brussel Sprouts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg#3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg there are better pics but this was mine. So good and so refreshing.  They're brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint, and puffed rice all charred up together. Didn't really care for the puffed rice but so good.\n\nAnother must have is their Tea Brined Ribs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q again there's probably better pics.  They're pork ribs in a citrus citrus-honey-tea glaze and sesame.  Sweet and tasty, not your typical BBQish pork rib.\n\nAnother must have is their Karaage  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#4SDCYEHrg0maFggCW_1T5g  I didn't take a good pic so I stole one.  They're this fried on the outside and juicy on the inside fried chicken pieces with jalapeno, mint, basil, and onion.  The best way I can describe it all is like fried frog legs but not really.  You bite into them and after you past their fried outsides it feels like it burst opens with it's moist insides. I don't really know how to explain it just try it. Spicy, yet refreshing. \n\nWho am I kidding almost everything is a must have. Here's a few more items I've had with a pic.\nThere's Gyu Sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw#8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw \nA Seasonal Sorbet Selection http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw#yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw \n\nEat everything slowly and in small bites that's how I'd eat it all. Nice interior and excellent service and very friendly staff. They have special daily items. And there's sake.\n\nIf you need a quick phone charge while you eat there's a power outlet next to the tables near the hostess counter.  It's right there so why not use it just don't go setting up shop there.\n\n3 more hour 'til 11pm I'll be there haha"
1,"Insanely awesome. All the meats have a beautiful smoky flavor. Though their sauces are good but not standout, its totally fine because the flavor and juiciness of the meats obviates the need for sauce.  Pulled pork sandwiches are big enough for a standalone meal.  Great bottled beer selections. Great staff. Great location, worth a trip from wherever you are coming from."
0,"This place does not fulfill the \""ultimate ice cream experience.\""  The manager is completely rude and inconsiderate to the customers requests. I go to this Cold Stone several times because the other ones are too far from where I live. I have found hair, bugs, and even broken finger nails inside my ice-cream. The place has cockroaches and the lobby is never cleaned. Every time I walk in, it is a disaster. The tables are sticky with ice-cream and so is the floors. The workers all tell me they dislike their boss and all want to leave.\n\nWhat kind of franchise is Cold Stone running?\n\nI do not recommend this Cold Stone at all!  I stopped going last month."
1,"Great atmosphere, nice staff. A bit pricey for what you get but it's all organic and healthy. My wife and I love this place."
1,"Holy smoked provolone I love this place! The only close second is Libretto's and their location in Ballantyne leaves much to be desired on taste and service...although they do have nice outdoor seating and ambiance. When it comes down to just taste I pick Tony's. You know pizza is good when you don't want toppings, side dishes, condiments, etc. When just a plain slice of hot cheesy goodness is heaven in your mouth, and you start wishing you could eat your weight in it. \nI am not sure if it's true, but when Tony's first opened one of the employee's told me their crust was so crispy and good because they use water from New York. I am not sure if this means they ship it here or have some sort of reverse osmosis time/space travel machine, but it's great. Tony's crust HAS what many \""New York Style\"" pizza restaurants in the south lack...crunch. Your pizza should have so much cheese it runs of the slice, the cheese should be so salty and delicious you could eat it alone, the sauce should marry the flavor of garlic and oregano on your tongue, and if you have to fold the slice to get its entire girth in your mouth then it should snap almost in half! I grew up mostly in Massachusetts, but I come from New Yorkers and I know good pizza...Tony's is good pizza!"
1,Awesome happy hour! Their microbrewed beers are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday Night Football.) They also have $2 well drinks and wine as well as a great selection of bar food for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with coffee beans and cocoa nibs. It was a delicious and different bittersweet ale with coffee and chocolate overtones. The service was friendly and fantastic!\n\nWe were only there for drinks this trip but will definitely return for more awesome beer and to try some of the yummy bar food!
0,"Oh dear, oh dear, where to begin....\n\nOnly out of laziness do I come here as often as I do. Situated no more than 200 yards from my work, if I'm going out for lunch it's an easy fix. And admittedly I do love their Pear, Rocket and Walnut salad... and that's about the only plus I can muster I#m afraid.\n\nIt's hard not to compare Let Me Eat to Thyme, which occupied the space in its previous incarnation. The former is managed by one of the latter's old staff, so I think that alone gives me licence. And with this in mind, I can't help but think they've looked at what Thyme did and tried to emulate it at half the cost. Unfortunately it shows.\n\nRolls and Paninis aren't filled quite so generously as they once were, salads are smaller, soups less extravagant. The whole set up smacks of a bunch of first-timers trying to make more money by spending less. \n\nOn my last visit I had Chicken Noodle Soup, which was chicken stock (fair enough, I'm a fan of that) and about 4 noodles and... well, let's say I'm STILL looking for the chicken! Thyme used to offer thick broths and meaty beasts packed with flavour and ingredients (Red Thai Chicken, Meat Ball, Smokin' Chicken.... these are soups!); Let Me Eat offer think, stock-based half-efforts.\n\nOne morning I opted for toast, a bargain at 50p you would think. Only both the bread and butter had been frozen overnight, so the bread cooled very quickly, and the butter was simply a clumped into the centre of the bread and the lad sandwiched it all together in the hopes it would melt into the bread by the time I got to work. Alas, it did not. Woeful.\n\nIt's a shame, because the staff are very warm and friendly, and I'd like them to do well. But to succeed with this venture they're going to have to invest in better produce and deliver heartier portions. Otherwise they will inevitably follow the path of the superior Thyme. If they couldn't make it... these guys don't stand a chance."
0,Thanks dude with the glasses. You were tacking in charges without explaining anything. Oh and usps does give you a tracking number bro. 70 cents. Thanks a lot for not offering all of your services. I would've left zero stars if I could have. The dude at the cash register was so rude and uninformative.
1,"We came back for the fajitas......and weren't disappointed at all!\n\nThe fresh chips, salsa and beans, and grilled onions & peppers were delicious and a great way to start the evening.\nWe both ordered the fajitas for two with pork and chicken.  My pork was packed with flavor, tender, and most amazing.  I'm totally not a fajita kind of guy, but you give me this place as an option; We'll be back!"
0,"Cost does not meet expectations. My $52 NY strip steak was more like a $28 - $32 NY strip. 4 people for dinner, $688 with tip and 2 $100 bottles of wine. I'm really disappointed with Bobby Flay. We ordered the wine, they bring to the table, then bring to the back to open - not cool.  The next bottle, I questioned them  about this (I'm not a wine snob / foodie snob, but my wife went to J&W so I've learned to recognize right from wrong over the years).  I also travel extensively for sales throughout the US and internationally.  I've had more than my fair share of steaks. The next bottle he opens at the table and pours the taste into a white wine glass - strike two. There was plenty of sediment in the wine, so I ask him to decant it. Again, before I can say anything, he rushes off to the kitchen to decant and brings it back. Strike three.  Low quality service attributed to POOR management. NO way that they should be getting away with this for the price they are charging."
0,"After foregoing the 45 min wait to sit inside, I decided to try the outside take-out window. You would think that on the last Friday of the year, when Vegas is more crowded than usual, there would be more than one person working the counter. Well I thought wrong as I stood patiently in line in 46 degree weather. I could see one guy taking orders, working the cashier, AND preparing the food. After a 25 min wait I finally approached the window only to be told half the menu items were sold out! Really?! So I ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate to see what all the hype was about. I am sad to say it was not worth the wait or $11! Very dissatisfied. The only positive is we didn't wait 45 min to be seated inside."
0,"Midway into the show, I realized I was at the David Copperfield MAGIC show not a comedy show. D.C's attempt at being funny was pathetic. AND I was seated in front of the speaker and each time when he was done was a trick a man would scream, yaaa and whistle hella loud. How lame is it when you have to have a recorded person cheering you on and to play the same thing about 20x's as if people are really that dumb to notice it's a recording. I agree with all the other reviews that the 10 minutes or so segment of his career was very self absorbent on his part. Ok we get it. You're a famous magician.\n\n\nI would not put it past him if the audience chosen to be part of the magic tricks were planted. Everything just seem fake and super cheesy!"
0,"I really like the triple order of cheese sticks at Toppers.  Their pizza really sucks, but the cheese sticks are pretty awesome.  I'm not exactly the most adventurous eater all the time, but i decided to try the mac and cheese pizza.  \n\nObviously they were copying Ian's in that department, but I figured since I like the Ian's pizza, i would try Toppers.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nOMFG, the first bite was awful.  I knew there was something off right away.  I lifted up the noodle cheese crust thing, and I realized that the whole crust was covered in some sort of orange glue.  Seriously, the pizza was covered in some imitation cheese-wiz.  I say imitation because cheese-wiz is better that the orange shit that was on my pizza.  And I ordered a large!  I actually threw the rest of the pizza away, because I wouldn't feed that shit to a dog."
0,Terrible service!! Rude manager! Lost a customer for life And the manager didn't care
1,"Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out. \n\nThe staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude) \nThe food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it. \n\nI don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast. \n\nThe waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us."
0,"Whose moronic idea was it to put a Sainsburys where Peckhams used to be??? Not only is there a (larger) Tesco a block away, there is a proper sized Waitrose about 10 to 15 minutes down the road. \n\nOk, they probably paid a lot of money to someone to do the market research and found that there's enough of a market to warrant opening another grocery store. Fine. But if that's the case, it needs to have a schtick. It needs to cater towards, say, the lunch and ready made meal crowd. Instead, this incredibly tiny Sainsburys thinks it's a proper sized store and stocks all types of items. As a result, it seems to have absolutely nothing reasonable.\n\nSo booooooooooo to this Sainsburys.  Bring back something with soul, or at least something that stocks more than 20% of my shopping list."
0,"This was my second time here, the service was dismal both times. We went in for the appealing happy hour, however we were not even offered a menu. \n\nCrystal the bartender appears to me miserable with her job. From a business prospective it doesn't make too much sense not to refill Customer's glasses. Putters management should be embarrassed by the service offered at their establishment. The DMV offers quicker, more friendly service.  \n\nAfter having an empty beer glass for 20 minutes I decided that it was time to cash out go to a bar that appreciates having Customers"
0,"The guy working Oct 18th turned then open sign off more that 20 minutes before the 8pm close time posted.  Went in and asked if the store was still open and the response wad \""I guess I could make something.\""  Lucky we only wanted drinks.  Owner should be pissed!"
1,"Mmmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm...Never Fails...\n\nThis place is UNBELIEVABLE for breakfast and Lunch (i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it).  \ni have only been for lunch twice, but both times were fantastic.  The first time i had the Burger (wonderful) and the second time i believe it was the Halibut (could have been Seabass) and was equally as delicious (i have posted a photo).\n\nWhat i really want to talk about is their Breakfast though...OMG-favorite spot in town.  I am a huge eggs benny fan and they have this Mediterranean version that is out of this world.  It's on Focaccia bread with prosciutto and this red bell pepper hollandaise sauce...SO GOOD (i have also included a photo of this dish).  Also, try their green eggs and ham.  :)\n\nHope you all enjoy this place as much as i do!!  Bon Appetit!"
0,"I used to love Ruth's, $10 haircut! And out the door in less than 30 minutes! \nI am a simple gal with simple needs. A $10 haircut is perfect.\nBut they have raised the price to a shocking $18, almost double and then an added tip? Eek.\nI still got a $10 haircut that took less than 30 minutes, but it cost me $25. \nI'll be going to the salon schools now. I would prefer Ruth's $10 haircut."
1,"I am writing an update & up-ing my rating for two reasons:\n\n1. Shortly after I placed my order in the store & wrote my review here on yelp, I received a phone call from the General Manager of the store, Mike (which was startling at first since on yelp we would never display our phone numbers, but he got it through my order)....  Mike made the situation right with me and offered to Fedex, at no charge to me, my purchase directly to my home.  He was incredibly kind and concerned about my irriatation. That kind of customer service is to be commended and praised!!!  Yes, the corporate part of the company should modify it's online & gift card policies.  It is in my experience that when interacting with clients and customers, you need to make a transaction as easy, as quick and as pleasant as possible!!  \nThe situation I had was out of the store's control, but yet Mike still went beyond the norm to correct my less than happy experience.\n\n2.  The product I ordered exceeded my expectations (I haven't set it up just yet), it is gorgeous and the online picture did not do it justice!  I'll post a pic after it's up and running.\n\nI've given Lamps + my business before and at this point I will continue to do so.\nThank you Mike, for being a good manager!"
0,"If I had to sum up my meal in two words: odd brunch. I started the meal with a kugel & strawberries based on another yelper's review - ate almost the whole thing! Would def order it again or serve it for guests at a brunch. Yum. The matzo soup tasted OK, felt like it was surrounded by canned chix noodle (ala Cambell's) though. Entre was holishkes (bland cabbage rolls with chunky marinara sauce), the sides seemed like random afterthoughts and portion size was enormous. My daughter ordered the kid's mac & cheese with a side of applesauce (which is always served in a ridiculously tiny cup). The wait staff were friendly and accommodating. It can be overwhelming and claustrophobic on a busy night but Sunday night was as chill as it gets. Next time I'm sticking with my fave dish there: open-faced tuna melt. Can't go wrong there.\n\nThe menus just kill me... I have learned over the years how to navigate them quickly but seriously Restaurant Impossible needs to come in and revamp here! A simplified menu featuring well made dishes to compliment some home made ice cream would have an immediate positive impact. That and some cleaned up, contemporary, functioning decor would really breathe some life into this place! We'll never stop coming here but will enjoy it MUCH more with some improvements. I'm rooting for ya Ella's!"
0,"I've been to Vs several times so that I could give them a fair chance. Each time I have found my experience to be lacking. The haircut was decent, not what you expect from a Barber I said to take off an inch they took off 2.  The customer service was atrocious. I've been to many different barber shops and expect a high level of service.  I expect the barber to try and make small talk with me even if its just asking what I do for a living.  Not only did the barbers not try, but they were rude and would speak in Russian to each other rather than interact with me.  If your going to a barbershop.  I recommend Gio's at 64th street and Bell or there is a shop at Tatum and Cave Creek that is great as well."
0,"You're definitely getting what you pay for staying here.\n\nI booked one night here prior to moving to a better hotel to save some money.  Thanks goodness we stayed only one night!\n\nPro:\n- Cheap price for a good location on the Strip\n- Room was a decent size, lots of extra space (probably because of the lack of furniture)\n\nCons:\n- The room felt like it was incomplete and could have used some extra furniture like more seating and mirrors.  The few furniture pieces that were in there were outdated and decrepit.  Opening and closing the drawers took a lot of effort because the wood kept sticking.\n- The bathrooms were horrible.  The shower didn't drain well so by the end of a bath you'd end up with the tub water being well above your feet.  At first we couldn't find tissue in the bathroom so we had to use toilet paper, but we later discovered the tissue box was oddly placed in the wall behind the towels.  If we hadn't used up the towels we probably never would have found it there.\n- The rooms have the motel style heater / AC rather than central air with thermostats.  In order to circulate air in the stuffy room, we had to keep it on all night but it was so loud and noisy that it kept us up.  Even worse, when we turned on the heater it let out some nasty, chemical smell that stunk up the room.\n- The elevators are old and slow.  The hotel doesn't have that many floors but the amount of time it took us to go from 1 to 11 equaled about 3x the amount of time it took us to go from 1 to 54 at our other hotel.  Plus, the sounds the elevator made has us all laughing that we would drop to our death at any minute.  On top of that, one of the elevators was broken in our tower so the wait too forever.  Luckily another guest, and not the staff, tipped us off that we could use the other tower elevators    \n- The casino was also stuffy and much like the rooms, air doesn't seem to circulate well there either.  Maybe it was the small size and low ceilings but we felt like we couldn't breathe whenever we walked through there\n- Definitely more of an older crowd that stays here.  If you're looking for the 20 - 30 yr old Vegas experience you won't find it here\n- Checking in took forever!  We got there on a Thursday afternoon and the line was almost to the door.  Took us 30 minutes to get through the line and check in.  I thought it was just like that when we arrived but it seemed like every time we passed the \""lobby\"" there was always a long line."
0,"I am so upset right now that I can barely write this. \n\nBeing a loyal customer since day one and recommending Amena to both family and friends I thought my business meant something to the owner. I, at the very least, thought that my loyalty would buy me honesty. I was wrong. \n\nA couple of hours ago I went into Amena to get some tabbouleh. Rosie prepared it. When I got home and tasted it, it was FANTASTIC!!! It was so good that I decided to go back and get another batch. \n\nThe owner was there and when I told him how good that Rosie made it, he told me that everyone makes it exactly the same. I replied that it was not exactly true. I've had it many times when it had way to much lemon, to little of this or to much of that. However, Rosie's was perfect and I asked him to please let her make it for me. He agreed. I went around the corner to see it being made and to my disappointment and surprise, he was making it. I told him that I wanted to try it before I paid $12.00 for a large. Sure enough it was loaded with lemon and I told him so. He said he'd retry. Second attempt; just as bad. \n\nHe justified his lie by saying that Rosie was preparing another customer's dinner. I informed him that since I made a special trip to get more of Rosie's tabbouleh I would have been more than happy to wait for her to finish with her customers. \n\nLet's break this down. Over arrogance and dishonesty the owner lost a loyal customer that has been patronizing and recommending Amena to many, many people since literally day one. That's the definition of stupidity. I'm also posting this on Yelp and any other review sites that I can. \n\nI'll now give all of my business to Afandi on West Charleston. It's closer to my house anyway."
0,"I was excited to try this place out.   Seating is very limited and wait times are around an hour.   After waiting for an hour to be seated, We waited another 30 minutes for a server to come and get our order and drinks.  When food came out it basically In-and-Out burger.. Food was gross..   Tried to talk to the manager but could get anyone's attention because they are so understaffed..  Will not be going back."
0,"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. My boyfriend had service with this company on a quarterly basis. They were instructed to call each time they were coming so we could have someone meet at the house to let them in to do interior and put the dogs away for the exterior. Right off the bat they would just show up and then call saying they were there when no one was clearly there to put the dogs out. They did this for months! Then they just starting leaving their service slip saying they did the back yard and would call to reschedule interior yet we never received a call. They could not do the exterior of the backyard due to a lock on the gate that we have so they were only servicing the front yard and not calling to reschedule anything. We tried calling them to find out what's going on and nothing got resolved. They then stopped servicing all together cause we refused to pay for a service we were not receiving. We then received a letter saying they wanted us to pay them the remainder of the contract (mind you a contract we never received) and it was no small amount or they were sending us to collections. I have since called them spoke to a Robin and I asked her to pull all the service tickets and also the so called \""contract\"" who informed me on 9/5 that she would email everything. 9/5 & 9/6 came and went and nothing received so I called and spoke to Robin again who told me give her til 9/8. 9/8 came and went and still nothing! Now, we have to fight with the collection agency because they wont cooperate. I DO NOT recommend them to anyone! I do not know of any pest control company that has contracts anymore other than 1 and that is only if you get termites. Other than that no one has contracts. They can not provide us with the signed service tickets nor this \""contract\"". Fed up and frustrated!"
0,Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.
1,"Only been one time, but it's safe to say I had an above average experience! I ordered the half pound Jalape\u00f1o Jack burger with a side of onion rings. The burger entailed a perfect spice, high quality meat (from Midwestern meats), and flavorful cheese. The onion rings were really great too! Decent portions here, I was definitely full. \nMy only problem is that my bill was $11 and change. A bit pricey for a no frills in and out styled place that caters to those who need a quick bite to eat after work or another event. I didn't even order a drink, mind you. Regardless it's but a minor set back in what was a really solid burger! I'd recommend it to others."
1,"Yellowtail is an exceptional restaurant with excellent food and incredible service. Some of the best sushi in the city. It has 1 of the best terrace views to watch the fountains at bellagio. The atmosphere was stellar and there were gorgeous people everywhere in the restaurant. A must try is the Kobe beef tataki, the big eye tuna pizza, and the Kumamoto oysters. The food was exceptional all around. I will def be going back sometime soon."
1,"This place is not only adorable, but delicious. You order at the counter and grab a table. They have a sweet and a savory breakfast menu, with a number of unique and fun drink options, including a 25 ingredient Bloody Mary. \n\nI loved the sweet potato pancakes with mascarpone and fresh strawberries. The cheesy BBQ pulled pork grits were also amazing!  They also have traditional eggs, bacon, potatoes and sourdough toast, which are good portions.\n\nThe restaurant is open for brunch and late night, for breakfast anytime. Definitely coming back!"
1,"I like SF Supermarket almost as much as I like Diho.  It's smaller, a bit more chaotic and a little bit grubbier, but not as chaotic or grubby as 99 Ranch.  Not that chaotic and grubby are huge minuses in my opinion.  SF Supermarket has more Vietnamese items than Diho or 99 Ranch.  I have a feeling I'll end up shopping at whichever market is closest to where I plan to eat any time I'm headed to that side of town."
1,"Very good quality / price ratio. Warm and friendly welcome, good effort to understand my broken English. Well located, very good comfort room and spacious. The restaurant on the 27 th floor very well. At recomander."
1,"My family and I love working with Allison. She helped us find a rental home and a year later help my husband and I buy our first house. Allison is very professional, knowledgable about the housing industry as well as the areas and neighborhoods in Las Vegas and Henderson.   She is easy to work with and will make herself available whenever you need her.  She just makes everything seem easy and stress free. Please allow Allison to help you with your housing needs. Whether it be to find a rental, buy a house or if you want to rent your home. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I like this place. When giving ratings to sushi restaurants in Madison, it's always hard to know if I should base it on a Madison scale or a national scale. In other words, if Sushi Muramoto delivered the same quality sushi in california, they'd probably only get three stars. But being that we're in the midwest, they deserve their four stars. I'd have to say that Sushi Muramoto is one of only two sushi places in town that serves decent quality fish.\n\nMy only complaints about the food are: 1. the red sauce they put on the bottom of some rolls is WAY too overwhelmingly spicy. It takes away from the taste of the roll. 2. you could tell that they used the shittier hamachi for the negihama roll compared to just the yellowtail sushi. I love love love yellowtail so I'll usually get two pieces of sushi as well as a yellowtail+scallion roll. There was a noticeable difference in the quality of fish they used for each :( Also, 3. I ordered coke and got pepsi. I know it's not THAT big of a deal but it's a big pet peeve of mine, so I thought I'd mention it anyway. Read my tagline. I hate pepsi.\n\nBut this place gets gold stars for not being overpriced. I feel like some of the more upscale sushi places can get away with charging outrageous prices for items that should be cheap (e.g. miso soup or inari). Here, I found that they don't really do that. So props to them.\n\nThe restaurant has a good vibe and a cool lounge you can hang out in while you're waiting for your table, which you'll probably have to do. I'd definitely come back."
0,"MESA,  AZ  PHOTO  RADAR  TICKETS  EXPOSED  AS  FRAUD\n\nIllegal police 'speed traps' are nothing new, but the increasingly low levels to which governments will stoop, to trick their constituents into believing speed traps are foolproof, know no limits - at least in gun-slinging, trigger-happy Arizona. \n\nThe Mesa Police Department has installed several photo enforcement cameras in anonymous locations, often near school zones.\n\nOne trap, at Skyline High School on Crismon Street between Southern and Broadway, consists of a pole with two signs mounted vertically: \""SPEED LIMIT 35 WHEN LIGHTS ARE FLASHING\"" and \""SPEED LIMIT 45 OTHER TIMES\"".   The problem is the lights don't flash, ever - making the posted speed limit 45 on this otherwise 7-lane, high-speed highway that runs, unfenced, within feet of the school campus.  \n\nOne citation sent to a local resident driving a Chevrolet Suburban in February indicated her speed was \""approximately 46 mph\"".   She was charged with \""speed not reasonable and prudent\"".   The \""ticket\"" was allegedly \""signed\"" by someone named \""Joseph Bonacci\"", whose badge ID #, coincidentally, end with \""911\"", under the guise of \""reasonable grounds to believe\"" a violation had been committed.\n\nFor those who can't see it, \""photo radar\"" is a ticking time bomb left in the terminal at the Airport of Due Process. \n\nFirst, \""approximately 46 mph\"" is not a legal standard of measure and, therefore, not evidence.  The operative word here - \""approximately\"" - is vague and ambiguous.   \""Approximately 46 mph\"" could be 47 mph or 45 mph or any other speed close to 46 mph which - absent the flashing lights - can not amount to conclusive proof of a violation of the de facto 45 mph limit.\n\nSecond, \""speed not reasonable and prudent\"" is an opinion open to broad interpretation, and not an exact measure: what is reasonable and prudent under one set of conditions may not be reasonable and prudent under another. \n\nThird, the statement, \""reasonable grounds to believe\"" clearly evades the mandatory language, \""violation committed in my presence\"", the required wording under which all law enforcement personnel issue traffic citations.   If it didn't happen in an officer's presence it's hearsay, which is inadmissible.\n\nAnother complaint last December charged a retired doctor driving a light-colored Nissan with the same \""speed not reasonable and prudent\"".   The same fake witnessing officer alleged the crime took place \""on Southern between Franklin and Brimhall\"" in the city of Mesa.\n\nIn researching this story we went in search of these locations to verify, photograph and document them.  \n\nIn the instance by Skyline High School, we maintained a day-long vigil on a typical Tuesday, with classes in session, monitoring the lights from 7 AM to 4 PM and found none flashing.   A random check of neighbors, whose homes are within the proximity of the light poles, produced no one who ever recalls seeing the lights flash.\n\nIn the second instance, we drove the length of Southern Avenue in the city of Mesa, eastbound and westbound, and found no streets named Franklin or Brimhall.  We interviewed a local Code Enforcement officer familiar with the area, but she never heard of any streets named Franklin or Brimhall intersecting Southern Avenue.   Finally, in desperation, we even went to the Mesa Post Office and - SURPRISE! - they had no record of any such streets intersecting with Southern Avenue, either.\n\nAll speed control enforcement equipment is mandated by law to be regularly re-calibrated to ensure it is operating accurately.   In most instances this must be done after EACH use.   Because of the cost, few law enforcement agencies bother.   Any member of the public has the right to see the latest re-calibration documents for any given speed control enforcement device.   If the device has not been re-calibrated, its accuracy cannot be relied upon, and any violation must be dismissed for lack of evidence. \n\nEPILOG:\n\nAn increasingly corrupt government - from local politicians to coin-operated Congress and the military - is becoming America's most vocal complaint about over-reaching government abuse of citizens' constitutional rights.\n\nMeanwhile, the credibility of Mesa's police department and city officials continues its southbound flush down the toilet of no return: their website claims to provide helpful links indicating red-light and speed enforcement locations and schedule.   However, these links have been disabled and no information is provided - amounting to one more false promise. \n\nIf you should receive a camera-generated traffic ticket, always assert your 6th Amendment Constitutional rights.\n   \nAnd if you think you'll just plead guilty, pay the fine and everyone will go home happy, think again: you'll have a chargeable traffic conviction on your record and your insurance premiums will quickly head north with all due dispatch.  \n\nAnd for fines ranging from $250 to $500 for each alleged offense, it is NOT worth it."
1,Based on Yelp reviews we stopped by and checked this spot out. The portions were big and the food was cooked to protection. The service was spectacular or I would have given it 5 starts. Our drinks were empty half of our breakfast and it took them 10 minutes to cash us out. I would go again to try something else on the menu for sure.
0,"I am not a big fan of Las Vegas shows because they do not interest me.  Mystere is the first cirque du soleil show I've been to and that's only because my gf took me here for my birthday. After watching the show I had a real conundrum about writing a review for this show because cirque fan boys can construe my opinion controversial. \n\nLas Vegas is a town for people to come to spend money to get entertained, so my review will primarily focus on the value proposition of the ciruqe shows. Is this show worth spending $100-150 for 90 minutes? No. There isn't any unique acrobatic material in this show that isn't available on the Internet or on tv shows like America's got talent. The filler part before the next act of the show is being prepared is really not that funny.  I will not go into details about the show since it my spoil the show for some. I think I can get more entertainment out at a movie theater for $10. \n\nI honestly think that ciruqe shows are a scam created by casino industry to get more money out of people's pockets."
0,"If you want high quality suits and good customer service, DO NOT go to this store!!  My family scheduled a Scottsdale trip at the end of the school year for our kids. In our rush to get out of Seattle, I only packed half my swimsuit.  The closest swimsuit place to our hotel was Everything But Water in the very upscale Kierland Commons.  My first impression was friendly, helpful and attentive service.  I found a suit that I loved with the necessary underwire in the top. It was close to $200  but I figured a quality suit is worth the price. I even bought a cute cover up that the sales girl suggested. Fast forward two days. After day two of swimming, I took off the suit and realized that one of the underwires had ripped through the fabric and had almost come completely out of the suit. I immediately took the suit back to the store. I thought for sure they would allow me to return the suit because it was clearly defective. No way!!  They only offered to exchange the suit even though you could see that the new top would have the exact same issue. I said I did not want such a poor quality suit and I wanted my money back. Still no refund. To make matters worse, my original sales girl kept smirking at the other sales girls as if I was trying to pull a fast one. I left with the new top because I had no other choice. I felt completely robbed!! \nI come from the land of Costco and Nordstrom where customer service is tops. This store should take a lesson.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter posting this review here and on the company Facebook page, I was contacted by Michele at Everything But Water corporate.  She was amazing!!  She contacted me personally, apologized for the inconvenience, assured me that I would be given a refund and let me know that my experience did not reflect company policy.  This was all done within a week of me arriving back home.  Do I still think that the service I received at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale (by one particular associate) was awful? Yes, hence the 1 star rating.  However, the company took great care of me after the fact, (Michele in particular) so I will be checking out the Bellevue, WA store to see if I have better luck in finding my perfect suit.  If Michele reflects the overall quality of employees at Everything but Water, I give them 5 stars!!"
0,"It took forever to have my order taken. The guy behind the counter takes my order and then walks away. When I receive my order it is all wrong, when I brought it to his attention, he want to argue with me.  Then another coworker comes over to try and help, he leave and then tells his cowork they are just trying to get things for free but how is that when I already paid for my order. I paid for avacado and there was none in there. Why should I get be charge extra and not receive it.  I have gone here before many times but when I see they guy working I will not return to this establishment."
1,Great fried chicken. Don't plan on doing anything after though because it will give you a serious case of the idis.
1,I was traveling for work and have always had a thing for irish bars making it a point to visit when possible\n\nI visited this place twice on my trip and was extremely happy both times \n\nA larger very irish themed space (with several real irish accents!) live music and several full bars.\n\nI had prompt service getting seated immediately (table and booth) great service my glass was never empty. Also an amazing scotch list (you must ask for it but they have good descriptions) \n\nThe fish and chips were great (and LARGE) their scotch eggs and sweet potato tots were awesome as well (first time I had seen them in tots form) overall cooked to perfection and about as non greasy as this sort of food gets and done perfectly (one of the first times scotch eggs did not just fall apart when I cut them)\n\nWill attend again!
0,"Please do not waste your time and money with this establishment.\nMy friends and I thought it was going to be a good time.\nWe actually enjoyed ourselves at first. We even opted to do VIP bottle service. But that was a bad idea. Smirnoff and Bacardi bottle service? Ha.\n\nBut one would think that if you dish out $$$ for VIP, the establishment would treat you well, right?\nNot at Rockhouse.\n\nThe guys in charge were rude and all around D bags.\nWe didn't have any problems with the girls working, though. They were great.\n\nDear bouncer,\nNext time someone is dancing, don't tap them on the shoulder and say \""Keep it for the bedroom\"" just because the one dancing is a guy. And then don't go on and talk about the law against lewd acts in public. Last I checked, this place was a club.\nDon't treat your VIP like children.\n\nBuy your guitar drinks a block away at Cabo Wabo in Planet Hollywood.\n\nAside from the bad experience. The place is small and you have to leave the club to go to the bathroom. \""Rockhouse\""? I question why they call it that when we heard NO Rock music.\n\nDon't waste your time and money on this place."
1,"Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person."
0,"Blah. Wow, is it just me. Went to Vegas for a quick trick (haven't been there in a while) and had an overall poor experience with food. I thought Vegas was picking it...trying to play with the big boys like NYC, San Fran and L.A. It's just not happening.\n\nFor the prices at this place, you should expect more. $18 for a salad...no creativity whatsoever, no unique ingredients, not organic, etc.\n\nEat lunch elsewhere. Only thing that was good was their onion soup--and I don't care for onion, but this one was decent."

0,"Ok, time to bring these reviews down to reality.\n\nNote: I am not an Hawaiian food expert so if you are, take that into consideration.\n\nThis Resturant has Kitchen nightmare written all over it.  The Resturant itself is in TOTAL disrepair.  Lights and air conditioning don't work, the carpet is filthy, the tables are scattered with outdoor lawn chairs, cables hang from the ceiling, decor is beyond decayed.\n\nFOOD: based on reviews here, I had the Hawaiian plate.  The pork had over 1 pound of pure fat in it.   Maybe that's the Hawaiian way, but for me it looked totally disgusting.   My wife had the teriyaki bowl.  Parts of it were burnt and afterwards she was complaining her stomach hurt.  Rice was ok.\n\nDETAILS\nResturant:  1/10 (this ain't homey -- it's rundown)\nAmbiance:  1/10 (scary!)\nService: 5/10 (a little slow but friendly)\nCleanliness: 1/10 (board of health should be concerned.)\nFood: 1/10 (we were trying to determine what was editable.

1,"I love this restaurant, I've been eating here for years (when it was still at Barbary) and not only is the food great but service is like none other!  Get the dover sole if you like fish and lamb if you like meat.  Delicious onion soup and salads are made tableside.  Its pricey but well, well worth it."

0,"my gf and i are avid bww patrons, i'd say every weekend we partake, however lately we've been experiencing a lot of problems with their pick-up / carry-out service which we often place orders through.\n\nfairly recently we've been having issues with them getting the order right.  typically they forget utensils, missing orders of celery and / or ranch, give us the wrong flavor, etc - but the line was drawn for us when we placed a 24pc wing order only to see that there were 12 wings in a 24pc box and the other half of the order was not included after coming home, relaxing in front of the tv and getting ready to eat.\n\nnever had we really experienced a problem with dining in (with the exception of the occasional lag of service when it's a little crowded) but all of these mistakes with carry-out has started to rub us the wrong way.\n\nwhen picking up an order, always always ALWAYS double-check right in front of them."
1,Amazing!  I'm here for a few short weeks from NY and I was recommended this place by a guy i met at an antique shop.  Superb!!  Everything fresh and delicious.
0,"This place is super sketchy. It's not in a good area of town. Everyone in there looks like a junky that's already used to shooting up, so sticking a needle in their veins is no big deal. There was no sense of direction, nothing. \n\nA friend of mine decided we wanted to donate our plasma and make $50. We walked in, and the place was chaotic. To our left, there was about 10 people standing at a kiosk. Next to them was 50 people in line waiting for god knows what. Then to our right there was a desk, and passed that was a waiting room. \n\nMy friend went up to the desk and told the guy (young Asian guy with glasses) we were new and weren't sure what to so. He was immediately annoyed. Asked for our id, proof of residency, and social. We handed them over and he said we needed to get our veins checked out. I said my friend took phlebotomy and she said I had good veins, just trying to be friendly and start a conversation. He rolls his eyes and said, \""well be the judge of that.\""  Well excuse me! \n\nWe sat down in the waiting room and cops was on. Everyone in there looked like they probably came from an episode of cops. About 6 of us got called back to get our veins checked. The asshole Asian dude was there, and he was complaining to the guy checking us that he had no reception, and when he did get reception it was shitty. Umm, aren't you NOT supposed to be on your phone at work?\n\nThe back room we were at had everyone donating plasma. It looked really sketchy. None of the phlebotomists in there looked happy, or like they even cared. 90% of the people donating looked like they were gonna take the money and go buy some dope as soon as they were done. My friend and I decided to leave. We had a really bad feelings and decided that risking getting HIV or hepatitis c was not worth the $50. We will not be coming back or recommending this place."

Unless your ok with the surf portion being one shrimp and a tiny scallop. \n\nFood was average to ok.\n\nBest part of this restaurant was the restaurant cool setup. Wouldn't come back to eat maybe just a cocktail.\n\nDidn't really feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nHostess was all over the place and having a drink at the bar on duty. Also when we walked in she was on her phone. Not really professional.\n\nServer was good. \n\nWouldn't come back unless I was going to have a few drinks late night.

0,"Worst experience for a first timer, which just made me a last timer. I will never go back to this place. They couldn't get any of my orders right. I ordered 2 Salmon sandwiches, ended up with only one, but was charged for 2. Then I thought a coffee sounded good, they got one of them but forgot mine, so after I reminded them, they couldn't grasp what a blended decaf peppermint mocha was. Once I tasted it I sent it right back and asked for my $ back. I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."

0,"Our stay here was decent, but I don't think we would stay here again.  I was running the rock n roll half marathon so I was thrilled how closely the hotel was located in relation to the finish line, and that was the main draw.  \nWe took the airport shuttle and our driver told us the hotel does not have a designated drop off area for shuttles so we had to be dropped at Harrah's and walk our bags over to the hotel which was a pain.  There were also no real signs directing you from Harrah's.  \nWe knew there was still construction happening so we specifically asked to be in a room that wouldn't have construction views or noise.  Well, we were placed right outside the construction and there was a chute right outside our window that chunks of concrete and building debris were thrown down.  It woke us up at around 7:30-8 on Monday morning and was so loud we were startled out of bed thinking it was an earthquake or something.   \nThere still seemed like other things that weren't completely finished.  The toilet ran for hours after being flushed and there was no info book in our room to reference for check out times, etc.  \nThe location was nice, close to the promenade, Starbucks, monorail, etc.  That's the main advantage I would say."
1,"I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food."

0,"Store manager Clinton does not represent Michael Bollig's vision of friendly or professional as stated on the website. Clinton was extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory. While arranging the delivery of my dryer we encountered a miscommunication and the coordination of delivering my dryer became complicated. Instead of Clinton taking responsibility for the miscommunication he made every excuse in the book and tried to pass the blame onto me. As I tried to explain the situation he talked over me, raised his voice and was very condescending. I expressed my dissatisfaction with his lack of customer service; however he did not seem to care. On the other hand, the delivery driver was very nice and accommodating. He waited over an hour for me to get home to make up for the miscommunication. I appreciated that greatly and displayed my gratitude with a tip. I was disappointed to notice a ding on my wall from the installation of my dryer after he left. I guarantee Clinton has cost B&B Appliances a lot of money by his lack of customer regard and therefore loss of future business.

1,"I tried this place for lunch today and really enjoyed the food and the pricing. The owners' little girl opened up the door for my wife and I. The whole family seemed excited to see customers and was very hospitable.\n\nThis place occupies the old Meatballz (next to Habanero's) and is very modern and has pleny of tables and elbow room. They cook the usual assortment of Chinese dishes and serve Sushi as well. This place is fast food that is cooked to order. They probably have over 30 dishes that they prepare. \n\nI had the Sesame Chicken, which was served with fried rice and  a vegetable egg roll. There was a heaping portion of chicken and it was delicious. My wife had an out of body experience with the Shrimp Lo Mein. She couldn't believe how many shrimps there were plus she was raving about how tasty the noodles were. All of this for about $8 per person (we had one soft drink). Also they have Diet Dr Pepper which is a major selling point for me.\n\nNeedless to say, we will be back to try the rest of the menu."

0,"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\n\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\n\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."

0,"I typically use Arizona Import Specialists in Tempe, AZ. Unfortunately; I had a gas line bust on one of my dual tanks. It was a Saturday so I used my AAA road side assistance (12 year member) to have it towed to The Car Shop. With the great reviews and the AAA recommendations I did not hesitate to have the work completed on my 1987 V-10 Custom Deluxe. They completed the work in a timely fashion. After I pick up the vehicle I filled the tank with gas and it didn't work. I took my truck back and they reviewed their work and the manager informed me that the switch was malfunctioning. I asked if they had tested it after the \""repair\"" work was complete. They said, \""No\"". It is common practice to test something that has been fixed. I spoke with the manager and we had a disagreement about what was wrong with the truck. He refused to fix it and wanted to charge me an additional $200.00 to fix something I already paid him to fix ($326.00). Needless to say I took my truck back to my original mechanic and they solved the problem right away. Problem resulting in a kinked hose - the one they replace. The arrogance and dishonesty from the manager was nothing short of a disappointment. I understand the dynamics of the repair and was willing to work out our differences but this man insisted the malfunction was not caused by the work he had done. This is a great example of a shop with great technicians/mechanics and terrible management.     \n\nyours truly,\n1987 Chevy Truck \nNM"
1,"Don't let the word \""grocer\"" in the name or the sandwich/salad-based menu available online fool you. This isn't just a deli or a grocery.  With the 7 or 8 daily specials on pasta, beef, and seafood, this is quietly one of the best Italian restaurants in town. \n\nNot to take away from the sandwiches, salads, or other antipasto, all of which are excellent and priced under $10. But the white board specials menu is where it's at. The specials range from risotto with shrimp, mussels, and sea bass, to homemade meatballs, to veal ravioli, to tuscan-style steaks. Specials range from $10 to $30. Wine available for sale on site, with a corkage fee for wine. You wouldn't expect it at this counter service-only spot with a sandwich-heavy menu and just a few tables, but this is a unique, fantastic, and authentic spot (particularly when the owner/chef and his friends are sitting nearby loudly speaking Italian with soccer on the TV!)."
1,"A friend and I went after lunch rush and before happy hour. Service was great, even in off hours. The Brie and fig flatbread was amazing. Surprisingly generous amount of lobster in Mac & cheese as well. The waitress successfully helped us choose beers, there were many choices of microbrews we hadn't had before. The ambience is great, beautiful tables. Wasn't sure if a place named pizza lounge would be good, but it was great. Classy, but fun.   We are looking forward to coming back."

I got the nachos and the chips were very stale but my friend got the burger and it looked really good. Good atmosphere. It's or after work hangout, if we can get everyone together more often.  :)"
1,"Very good.  Nice staff, good bar food selection and nice space.  I am reluctant to eat at a restaurant in a strip mall BUTTT this place was very good.\n\nThe food was good.  Loved the homemade mushroom soup.  The waitress was VERY friendly.  The clientele was relaxed and subtle.  \n\nAs I wind down my year in Wisconsin I can definitely say this place is very Wisconsin and for that I appreciate it even more."
1,"I will say this. This is against anyone who says \""The shuttle waits too long\""...Its this and that. Look, if you don't want to pay $6 for a SHARED VAN SERVICE...then go and spend the expensive hourly luxury cars per hour. Look. This is a very clean bus, more like a party bus without all the bells and whistles but it sure does not come close to a rink, clattering competitors shuttle. Their reps from start to end were very helpful and courteous and this was at 7am! Bright and early.\n\nAll and all, I have found the company I will use for all of my LAS needs. I recommend this company to anyone who wan"
1,Food is great as is the service.  The restaurant is large so there is usually no wait.  This is a great family spot.  Give it a try.
1,I trust Almar's to fix our three cars. They have been honest and upfront about repair options and costs. I called today when my Honda Pilot wouldn't not start. Andy was so helpful and gave me some ideas about what may be wrong. He was able to fit me in and replaced my battery quickly while I waited
1,"This joint packs tons of character in such a small space. With art covering the walls and a quirky type of jazz coming out of the speakers, the atmosphere is simultaneously fun and mellow with friendly baristas to match. Small groups will find it more spacious outside on the patio, but there are a few tables inside. Solo sippers have more freedom with all the counters and barstools along the walls. If you don't intend to get cozy, MadHouse also has a drive-thru; if you do, it's open all day and all night.\n\nTheir sizes have normal names! A medium blended drink comes in a 24-ounce cup, the equivalent of a Starbucks venti in size, but its contents are full of creativity and taste. Their grasshopper is a subtly minty mocha combination. I like their crushed coconut mocha, but have much more of their menu to try. I've only indulged in their blended drinks, but their brewed coffees and sandwiches tempt me every time! \n\nIf you want to use their internet, let them know when you order and you'll receive a one-time use code. The time limit is based on how much you spend (e.g. $4-7 = one hour of WiFi, $10+ = four hours), so the more you pay, the longer your WiFi privileges stay. \n\nI haven't settled on a favorite drink yet, but I've discovered my new perch."
1,"I love this place.  It caters to my OCD.  I like to have things in places where I can find them.  My hubby is always amazed, whatever he is looking for in our home, if he asks me, I know exactly where it is.  I am now organizing the twins bedroom, they have tons of stuff that need to be contained."
1,"My family and I just returned from a spending our 1st week  at The Grandview, Las Vegas. We loved the accommodations. Anything you would need and most of your wants are right there at our disposal.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted so kindly and directed to the front desk, where we met Steve Stephens, who was courteous and humorous  all while being professional.  Mr Stephens got us checked in in a matter of minutes and we were on our way to spending the most relaxing week ever.  \n\nWe stayed in a 2 bedroom (double everything), the housekeeping was immaculate.  The decor was just as we remembered from the previous year's tour. The bedroom mattresses fit our bodies like a nice warm hug :).   The jet tubs are awesome and every girl should have own vanity like the one in the bathrooms.  The staff the grounds were all very profession and courteous. \n\nNow, they gave us one complimentary week (on one device) of Internet. But they wanted like $50 additional for the 2nd device, that is extremely pricey.   The property is grand, however, the workout room is tiny (only one for the whole property)  and the issue of parking were our only disappointments.  For this reason, I wanted to give a 4 1/2 stars, but that's not possible here and there was no way I'd give The Grandview 4 stars only, so 5 stars it is :) \n\nThat's pretty much it!  I would encourage all of my friends and family to buy a timeshare here at The Grandview."
1,"I would come here every saturday if I could... it's the best place I've been to in Vegas. It has the Pussy Cat Dolls performing in the lounge and a great patio overlooking the strip. The whole place kind of makes you feel like a celebrity and it's not overly crowded. \r\n\r\nBut my water cost $7!!! For God's sake, get your drinks while you are gambling instead!"
0,"Was in one night for a show next door, but decided to go cheap.  Cheep it was!  All show and no go.  It's a beautiful hotel from the outside, but I think It is just old now, and service didn't help.   We were getting a \""non smoking\"" room, but we got to the room and it was really stinky and smokey.  I called and they said just come down to the \""manager's desk\"" and they will get us a new room, so we hiked down and not one person was willing to help us.  When we finally got to someone, she rudely said go to the desk at the very end.  We did, and no one was there.  Waited 10 minuted before going to here again, and she was just annoyed at this point with me.  She told me to wait there and someone would help me.  So I did, and about  10 minutes later, someone stumbled down to us and told us to go the the OTHER SIDE!  If you have been here, it is a long desk!  Especially when you have 2 full bottles in your bag, ha ha.  \nOverall, just a bad customer service experience, maybe if we were there 1 hour prior, it would've just been an old hotel and not so horrible.  Would I stay again?  Only if I HAD to save money and the show was next door.  Other than that, yeah no."
1,"Visited Arizona with a couple of architect friends, so the Phoneix Library had to be a stop :)  The outside of the building isn't nearly as impressive as the inside.  But wowie, when you're inside, it's like a whole other world.  The details and attention to spacing are amazing.  Not to mention it's a LEED certified building (green building) which is pretty cool.  If not to check out books, you gotta at least check out the building."
0,"Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience here... I took my Mother to lunch for the first time and we both ordered salads. The cashier asked us if we wanted to add chicken - we both replied \""yes\"" and she said \""cold or grilled\"" - we both said grilled. Our total bill was a little higher than expected so my mom nicely asked why. The girl was extremely rude and said, \""grilled chicken is more.\""  and basically laughed at my mom for even asking the question... We were not rude, we did not ask for it to be taken off the bill - just a simple question. I've worked in the service industry for years and it rubs me the wrong way, because she was completely polite while asking a valid question. I have had lunch in the actual dining room and I had a wonderful experience with a MUCH more friendly staff, so I will just stick to that instead."
0,Stay away from this company. The customer service reps like to lie.I had my hours cut so I went online to skip service for last week. I got the confirmation email saying it was skipped then it showed up anyway. I called right away and was told I was going to receive a refund in two days. When I called to check on the refund they told me they gave me a store credit instead. I told them that the money was needed for bills and needed the refund. They said ok and took my card for the refund. I still haven't seen the the refund and called today and now was told I should see the money on Monday. Thanks winder farms for making my gas payment not clear.
1,Been to Yama twice and both times were awesome! My husband and I ordered the all you can eat sushi. The sushi were quite delicious and they also had a variety. Will definitely recommend.\n\nMy only complaint is that the price for the children's all you can eat was the same as the adults.
1,"Weekly brunch #4 brought my friend and me to Mimi's Cafe today.  First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.  \n\nWhat's nice about Mimi's Cafe:\n1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).\n2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.\n3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.  \n4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.\n\nThere WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not)."
0,"What a disappointing experience!  I had the fried chicken with sweet potato waffles.  The chicken was ok but it was a weird pairing with the sweet potato flavoring of the waffles. For sides, I had macaroni and cheese and green beans.   The macaroni and cheese was only ok and the green beans tasted like they were right out of a can.   The biggest let down of the evening was the red velvet cake.   It was pink and tasted like a jello poke cake."
1,"Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge."
1,"I came to the Jean Georges Steakhouse for a group dinner hosted by some guys with whom my firm does a lot of business.  The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu. \n\nThe table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary. \n\nI chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. \n\nHow disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.\n\nMy dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. \n\nTwo comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?\n\nOverall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place."
1,"I love Farm Basket! They seriously have the best fast food fried chicken. I tried this place about a year ago because I had a groupon and I keep coming back. I usually get the fried chicken dinner with roles, mashed potatoes, and French fries but today when we went through the drive thru. I ordered the chicken fingers meal. Omg it was amazing! Crispy chicken strips, juicy not greasy and it was all white meat chicken. The honey mustard sauce was awesome as well. I also ordered for the first time there cheesy fries. They were so good I didn't want to share! Shoe string French fries with gravy and cheese. I was in carb heaven! And I'm usually not a gravy person. This place is amazing I would recommend to go here when you're having a craving for fried chicken."
0,"(My fiancee and I stayed here 3 1/2 weeks ago. I'm just going to be brief and go over the pros and cons of the place because it was nice, but not \""great\""; we'll probably stay here again if we can't find a better option-)\n\nCons:\n\n1.The Weather: \n\nBe warned! Vegas is a *desert*: We went in May thinking it's be cool-ish and mild-ish: It wasn't!! It was very muggy (It rained) and very, very windy-felt like the inside of a hairdryer every time we went outside; the hot, high winds (Gusts up to 60+ mph) made \""walking the strip\"" very unenjoyable. Our bad and we'll more than likely not go there between the months of May-August next time, but still; I hate being cramped up inside! :/\n\n2. Our Trip (Cut Short due to the Weather): 2 stars off\n\nMy fiancee and I were booked here for 4 days but ended up leaving a day early due to inclement weather. I know it's not fair of me to take a couple of stars off, but we had really been looking forward to relaxing poolside and getting a cabana each day, only to find the pool open only 1 day out of what would've been 4: Blah. :/\n\n3. The Weird WIFI and \""Fine Print Resort Fee\"" Charges: 1 star off\n\nAdditionally, they have this Game that they play where they \""say\"" you get \""Free WIFI\"" in your Room but you're charged the fee for it and it's \""taken\"" out of your Resort Fee at the end...something like a charge-back it was explained to us..Yeah, okay, sure sounds shady...BUT I want to clearly state that after looking over our statement after our Trip, we were charged-back the WIFI fees..but we had this nagging, in-the-background-uncomfortable, \""will they charge it back or not\"" feeling, which put a small damper on our enjoyment. I also think that they should've been way, way more \""upfront\"" about the Resort Fee vs. making it a \""fine print\"" item that you kind've..discover upon checking in. :/\n\nPros:\n\n1. The Oyster Bar: Pretty decent, I've had better, but not bad for Vegas.\n\n2. No nasty smoke smell\n\n3. Clean, quite rooms (Albeit slightly worn down)\n\nAll in all, my fiancee adores this Casino and wants to stay here again. Me, not so much; there's plenty of other places to stay that I'd like to check out..."
0,"From the moment you arrive at Luxury Suites international you realize that what you paid for makes you less valuable as a guest than going directly through the hotel. The luxury suites are privately owned therefore you will not get the same service as the others staying in the hotel, something you should be aware of if you choose to reserve through amazon or travelzoo. The \""customer service\"" reps: Natasha and Nicole don't have a clue how to make guests feel welcome. In fact if you booked through Amazon or Travelzoo you will soon be aware that other guests booking directly with the hotel are treated differently. Sometimes it's difficult to put your finger on a person's attitude but in this case there is a bit of animosity for those who took advantage of a special. The hotel is nice but I can't emphasize enough, if you feel that Nicole or Natasha the two \""customer service representatives\"" have an attitude, it's time to call the hotel directly. Natasha treats guests as if they are asking for a handout. While the hotel itself has some wonderful qualities the team at Luxury Suites will make you regret booking through them. Whether you need a pillow, housekeeping or a razor (like most hotels will give you) you will be told told by the signature that this is not their concern. Better spend a few more dollars than dealing with these woman who believe that discount guests are more of a nuisance than a valuable part of their business. Furthermore, if you book through Luxury Suites International, a \""balcony vista\"" with a view of the strip is more like a view of another hotel. Beware as all rooms are non refundable. Live and learn."
0,"The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). \nWhat should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat."
0,"I guess I'll start with the good. \nThe service was excellent. The waiter was incredibly nice and we got a complimentary lettuce wrap appetizer since it had been a while since we had visited. The waiter was attentive and really nice. Even offered to get us a GF lettuce wrap for my boyfriend. \n\nThe mediocre: the food. \nIt was okay. I guess. You know what you're getting when you go to a PF Chang's and I must have forgotten it's just bland. My boyfriend said his fried rice was good. But how can you mess up fried rice? \n\nAnd, the bad. \nThe floor was disgusting. It was covered in food. I watched someone clear a table and just push the food onto the floor. No one came by and swept it up. It wasn't just one part of the restaurant. There was food all over the entire floor and this is no exaggeration. It was really gross and off-putting. \n\nThere are other restaurants to go to down on Mill that are much cleaner."

0,"This review is for Delta Mechanical -- both AZ & CO. I live in CO but also dealt with the corporate office in AZ. I've tried to keep the review concise as possible...but the reality is, I could have written 10 pages on how disconnected the company is and just how little client service is to their organization.\n\nAs a third-party installer to Home Depot, Delta Mechanical was contracted to install a toilet for me and my family. I placed the order and scheduled the install one week out for an 8-10 AM delivery/install to minimize delays or issues.\n\nAt 8:30 on the day of install, I received a message from Delta Mechanical that they didn't have the necessary information to complete the scheduled install. I talked to both the installer and the corporate office to try and resolve. \n\nUpon my first call to the installer, I learned that although he might be a pro at installing toilets, he was anything but when it came to customer service skills.\n\nWhen I asked him what the problem was with the order and what he might need from me, he basically said, \""I've already moved on to my next job. Nothing I can do.\"" \n\nUnderstandable, considering the mix-up...only, he had ZERO interest or motivation to help. I asked that he call dispatch to find out what the issue was or where the disconnect occurred....to which he made it clear that he was busy and that he was already on his way to another job. WOW!...so, I was kind enough to give him a piece of my mind and how unprofessional that attitude was when facing a customer.\n\nThat's when I called the office directly to explain my frustration, having had to take off work for the original installation time and then to be told by the installer that helping me couldn't be fit on his plate at the moment.\n\nThat's when the customer service representative mentioned that she had called me \""one hour\"" prior to delivery to discuss the issue...the only problem is that she was in a different time zone, so it really was only 20 minutes before the schedule install time.\n\nSo, I quickly learned that I'm probably working with people who aren't quite ready to run a business or to handle customer service issues or problem solve. She said she would have to review the phone call order and \""get back to me\"", but offered no estimated timeframe or next steps -- one hour? one day? one week?\n\nClear to say that my frustration continued to grow. \n\nDelta Mechanical tried to blame it on Home Depot, but I sat at Home Depot when we originally placed the order and confirmed that all of the information had been given to Delta Mechanical.\n\nWhen talking to the customer service representative and eventually the Delta Mechanical Manager (George Ramos), they confirmed Delta Mechanical only looks at orders the day of installation, which makes ZERO business sense and probably a good reason as to why I'm as frustrated with them as other reviewers. \n\nI'm still baffled how an order placed 7-days in advance cannot be reviewed or confirmed prior to 20-minutes before install. SERIOUSLY!\n\nMr. Ramos' plan to fix it included me rescheduling my afternoon (already after rescheduling my morning) and to give me their \""New Client Promotional\"" rate with an added $20 off. Now, my bigger question was, \""Why am I just now hearing about this  promotional rate now that I'm an unsatisfied customer and nearly two hours after the first sign of incompetence on Delta Mechanical?\"" Rhetorical question of course.\n\nI let him know that promotional rates are for customers looking forward to doing business with Delta Mechanical, and that at the moment I was pretty dang far from that...having taken off work, rescheduled my weekend, and after spending two hours on the phone bouncing from installer to customer rep to manager while experiencing some of the most dreadful customer service ever -- without any resolution, other than $20 off their promotional rate they failed to offer upon my initial order and giving up my afternoon on top of the morning already wasted.\n\nMr. Ramos' response was, \""It sounds like I should just cancel your order.\""\n\nTalk about CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nI did call Home Depot back and we're in the process of making the situation better, including using another third-party installer instead of Delta Mechanical.\n\nI know I'm just one customer/voice, but I let Home Depot know that as long as Delta Mechanical is a third-party vendor, I will be taking my future purchases somewhere else.\n\nAgain, we're in the process of finding a remedy in conjunction with Home Depot, but the ONE GUARANTEE I have at the moment is that Delta Mechanical WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, thankfully!\n\nPlumbing and HVAC aren't my specialty, which is why I wanted the pros to do it...but take a lesson from me, there are a lot of companies and people who can install plumbing infrastructure the right way without leaving a soiled taste in your mouth. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with another company that has a better overall rating that TWO STARS on Yelp...you won't regret."
0,"Recent Friday eve....solo dining....2 other diners present at 7 pm. That should have been my first clue that this would be forgettable meal. Started with very small dinner salad with a tasteless \""cilantro\""? dressing @ $3.   Entree of bowl of Posole. Broth was very flavorful, but contained just a few small bits of pork and over cooked, bland posole.  I was stunned when I received the check....$12 for the soup!  No wonder this place is empty. Mediocre, boring food at outrageous prices. Whoops, just remembered how crappy the coffee was."
1,"Court Curios is a small, quirky shop on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. It sells a number of curiosities, from vases and crockery to an assortment of antique jewellery of all shapes and sizes.\n\nPrices vary depending on what you're looking to buy, but it's definitely one to keep an eye on as they have some unique items on offer. Some of the rings are very expensive but extremely regal. With its less expensive gifts, its great if you're a tourst looking for an alternative gift to take home!\n\nTucked away towards the Castle, it's a wee bit of a climb up the hill but worth it if you have been sickened by the rest of the Cashmere shops on the Royal Mile. Old, unusual jewellery at its finest!"
0,i dont know if the management changed again?  the place smells of cleaning supply when you enter. the buffet is horrible. its almost like the dishes are fightng for the worst tasting food competition.
1,"Delicious food.  If you are opting out of wine, try the cucumber honey lemonade.  It is so crisp and refreshing!  You cannot go wrong with the bruschetta--my favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese.  I could have done without the toddlers on either side of us, but hey, when in Gilbert."
1,"My boyfriend has taken me here twice and I really loved the food both times. It didn't take long after we ordered for our food to be done. The strawberry limeade is a DELICIOUS drink but I didn't really love the miso soup, wouldn't order it again. The dish I ordered was the beef and broccoli...AMAZING both times. First I ordered it with fried rice which was okay, the second time I ordered it with regular brown rice and this was better. I just felt like I could enjoy the perfect flavor of the beef and broccoli more when the rice \""had a little less going on\"". \n\nWe will definitely go back to Ling & Louie's for the food (and the limeade) but I really can't say much about the service here. The hostess was friendly both times but the wait staff wasn't great to us either time...not rude but nothing to rave about either. Also it was a little awkward for me to have most of the staff in my direct line of sight standing in the kitchen area either A) eating, B) fooling around with coworkers, or C) standing around doing nothing...both times we were there. \n\nThe food is awesome though, so we'll be back!"
1,"You know what? This place ain't half bad. At least not as bad as how all the reviewers have been making it look like. But it seems like everyone is bitching about the general \""inexperience\"" of the security staff above anything else. I got let in pretty quickly and even had a nerdy stocky lady bouncer give phone directions to my friends over my phone without attitude or trouble.\n\nIf you read my other reviews, you know it's very difficult for me to speak positively on stuff like this in general. So congratulations Hakkasan! You didn't piss me off! And you put a smile on my face!\n\nAsians almost never smile!\n\nHowever, we did have comped tables thanks to a friend that has close connections with the senior staff in this venue. So I am reviewing this place based on a pretty concise VIP treatment. \n\nOur host is fairly attentive and so is her busser. Never, once, have I ever needed to ask her to fill my drink when I was going dry. Which was a issue I had at 1-Oak where I had to fill my own glasses.\n\nThe best way I can describe Hakkasan is that it's just like Tao. It has a Asian theme, and has a restaurant downstairs. However, it is not as douchy as Tao. Now given, I seen a few catfights between girls jump off right in front of me in the hip hop room, and this being my first day, it does embarass and make the club look bad. But hey, at least I didn't get into a fight for the bathroom line like I did in Tao (read my Tao review), because there are more than FOUR bathrooms with NO LINES!\n\nAnother reviewer is complaining about the \""bitchiness\"" of Asian girls in the club. Personally, I never had this problem because not only do I NOT talk to random Asian girls that are looking for their rich White Knight with a green card, but I have my own friend circle of hot Asians with me :p \n\nThe key is building your hot friend networks OUTSIDE the party scene, because anyone who thinks that they can get laid on the first night of meeting a girl at a club will just catch a nasty case of herpes, and HIV if they are unfortunate (:\n\nI enter the club with people I know, and leave the club with the same folks. And for anyone I met that night, ill hit them up the next day after giving them time to think about me (:\n\nThat's how you stay safe, and not missing any kidneys the next morning!"

We have been going to East Side for years, The previous owners Jerry and Peggy were awesome. Made you feel like you were going to Uncles pizza place and now its like the soul of the pizza and the place are gone. For a NY pizza Joint cirque de soleil decor does not work nor does it distract you enough to notice the food, the pizza, the environment and oh by the way the portion size is not the same anymore. The staff is loyal and doing their best but the new owners just don't get it and unfortunately just don't care."

0,"This is a English/Scottish hyrbrid pub with a tad bit of Irish thrown in.  I am a huge fan of bangers and mash and so I couldn't wait to try out everything.  The hosts and servers were great and we were promptly seated.  There is a fairly new, clean interior that is split into a bar section and a dining section with some overlap depending on the group and what they are looking for.  I liked the atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we settled on the following items:\n\nGaelic four onion soup\nScotch eggs\nOpen faced roast beef\nBangers and mash\nDraft Rootbeer\n\nThe Onion soup is NOT a French onion soup.  It is its own entity with its own ingredients and flavors.  Over time, I have learned to just expect a French onion knock-off when it comes to onion soup.  Kudos to Piper's Pub for doing something different.  There is a large crouton with stilton baked into it.  It tastes quite good with the soup.  My only issue with the soup was the onions -- they were not completely tender.  Is it possible to have the onions in the soup cooked a little longer to completely soften them up? I know this is a personal preference and I would probably order the soup again but I would only consume the broth.  \n\nWhile eating the soup I ordered a draft rootbeer.  Completely excited about having a good, fresh rootbeer.  I was somewhat flustered to find that it was somewhat weak when I tasted it, though.  The flavor was there, but why was it so watered down?\n\nMy first time having Scotch eggs.  It is a hardboiled egg encased in ground sausage, fried, and then served with hot sauce.  The flavors were interesting, but it was difficult to get past the flavor of the exterior.  It tasted overcooked and bordered on burnt.  Is this normal?  As we finished this novel, new appetizer our entrees arrived.\n\nBoth entrees looked awesome.  Spectacular presentation for both entrees.  I went directly for the sausage and my palate left me perplexed.  The banger they use has a heavy-handed spice.  I tried the sausage with the half-mashed potatos and the gravy in differing quantities and couldn't get past the flavor endemic in the sausage.  I had to stop eating it.  I was able to split the open-faced roast beef with my friend.  The gravy was good.  The half-mashed potatos were good.  The roast beef was good.  WHY did the bangers have such a high dosage of this anathemic spice?  \n\nHo Hum.  Will I return?  Yes, I will give Piper's another try; I will just make certain to steer clear of the bangers."
1,"Rula Bula has an excellent menu (I recommend the Rosemary Salmon Salad), great beer selection (Boddington's!) and wonderful service. The staff here is superb (and delightfulyy quirky!!!) and I love the Irish/Gaelic music; it serves as a great workweek lunch reprieve!"
1,"What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:\n\n1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.\n\n2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking versus using decor to convince you that things are better than they are in reality."
0,"We couldn't believe this place. A tiny taco costs u $6. Come on, PLEASE. I ordered the noodle that the bartender recommended, It's so small that i thought \""it's gotta take 4 of these to fill me up\"". When we wanted separate, he gave us a weird look. Come on man. you never asked us if we wanted separate checks. \nSave your money, take a cab to Chinatown (2 miles from the strip). and get some real Chinese (or Vietnamese, or Korean)."
1,"Birthday celebrations should be done up big and Beso definitely fits that description. From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.\n\nWe got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.\n\nWhen the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.\n\nFor entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.\n\nFor dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  \n\nThis is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele."
0,"I waited for an awesome meal at a place I visited over a decade ago.  I remember the prime rib, crab and seafood from before but I was disappointed in the selection this time. It had more Chinese, Mexican and fruits than I remember.  I saw no real potatoe dishes other than mashed.  Sushi wasn't good.  However the prime rib as great, crab was abundant and calamari excellent.  Pre-made salads were not good.  My husband is a meat and potatoes and he barely found stuff to eat.  I would like to see a price that matches the lack of selection.  I would like to see more sushi that tastes good and more hot crab than cold crab."
0,Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.
1,"DAAAYUM!!! The previous reviews of this restaurant were very good and I set out to try it before...but it was closed. I forgot about it for a few weeks and decided to give it another shot this afternoon for lunch. I am so glad that I remembered this place!\n\nI am not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The place is in the back corner of a little strip shopping center which was otherwise non-descript and I would probably have driven past unless I was specifically looking for something. As I approached I saw a nice size patio with outdoor seating. It was a nice day and I was tempted, but I went inside. The dining area was very spacious containing several tables without being overcrowded. Another thing that stood out was the smell. It smelled really good and it further increased my hunger.\n\nThe table was big, which is a good characteristic for me. I don't know how many places I go and they stick the big dude at the little table. I also thought the menu was cool. Nice thin wooden cover with an expansive listing of sandwiches, entrees, beers and wines. I would love to go back for the wine dinner, but being lunch I just ordered a sandwich. Another nice touch was the silverware. The waitress brought the silverware to the table in a mason jar. It is something different and really makes the place cool. Great atmosphere.\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich - which I don't care for chicken salad, but I did have a taste and it was good. Chicken, apples, nuts - very hardy. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was piled high. Good solid bread, thick meat and an incredible taste.  I had the potato salad side and my friend had the pasta salad. One thing I liked about both salads and the chicken salad also was the focus on flavor and ingredients. These items were not loaded down with mayo like so many other places. Instead, this restaurant let the main ingredients do the talking - the chicken salad made the chicken the focus item, followed by the apple and nuts. No heavy mayonnaise. Same with the potato salad - you tasted the Yukon yellow gold potatoes. The bread & butter pickles as a garnish took me back to my youth. My grandmother in Southern Ohio canned bread & butter pickles annually. Yum.\n\nI had to go for dessert, but I went with something small. I went with the lemon bar - sweet, tart and tasty. I wouldn't go specifically for the lemon bar as I might with something like Oregano's cookie, but this was a good finish to the meal. The sandwiches were both $8.50 (and well worth it), the lemon bar was an economical $2. Another cool & funky aspect of dinner was the smashed bottle serving plate. I like quirky little touches like that which help make the experience unique and memorable.\n\nReally the only thing that might be a fraction of a reduction for me was that it was a little loud and made it challenging to hear the conversation and the soda was a standard 20 oz bottle rather than a fountain drink. Small things and not really distracting from the overall excellent experience. I will definitely be back to this place many times. If you are in or around the area, stop by and make sure to give this place a try!"
1,"This is a great option if you just want to grab a good lunch at Kierland without mortgaging your house. Its essentially the non-chain answer to Paradise Bakery. The restaraunt was clean and inviting. My wife had the Chef's salad which was large and had lots of meats and cheeses. I had the \""American Grilled Cheese.\"". The tomatoes were fresh and ripe and the bacon was thick and cooked properly. You can also get an ice cold beer if you want. There are also some great specialty sodas available.\n\nI would go back for lunch and I reccomend this place for anyone who doesn't want to break the bank for lunch at Kierland."
0,"I've been to Black Bears throughout California and this one was not nearly as good as the others.  \n\nThe biscuits were hard and dry and I just was not that happy with our breakfast here. \n\nThe portions are still crazy big but the quality of food and what you pay more just aren't what I had expected.  \n\nIf you are going to be a chain restaurant of sorts, everything should be consistent and this location is definitely not compared to others...."
0,"Not sure it is real or fantasy in mind of somebody.  I  pre-purchased detailing for my mid-size SUV through Groupon. To make this short, it is next to impossible to contact them. Oh, you can call or text, but be prepared for no answer. If you do contact them and they arrange to come to your place, be aware that most likely they will never appear.  This review is based on my calling or texting them repeatedly and setting up two appointments with them to come to my house. On neither occasion did anyone appear.  Unless you want to waste your time, don't do business with this so-called business. For me, I hope I get my money back from Groupon. Then I clean the car myself."
1,"A premiere outdoor shooting range in the East Valley. Well managed, and affordable memberships and per visit prices.Multiple ranges: The main public range has covered shooting benches with target holders from 25 to 300 yards with three clay bird throwers for Shotguns, A Practical Pistol range with 4 bays from 25 to 50 yards, A covered 40-position Smallbore Range to 100 meters, Covered long range rifle and pistol silhouette ranges to 500 meters, High power rifle range to 500 yards,Sporting Clays Range - 16 stations.\nBut probably the best thing about RSSC is the competitive shooting matches it hosts. I would guess it has more matches in a month than some ranges have all year long (okay, I exaggerate). While it hosts several Major matches through the year, it's membership is comprised of many world-class shooters, so even its local matches are a cut above the rest. It's like going to your local golf course and being able to play a round with Tiger Woods! I've learned so much just watching these guys and shooting next to them. What a blast!"
1,We just moved to the area and were looking for a good place to work out. We decided to try the rec center and got a 1 week trial period. We worked out at different times during the day and were always able to get a treadmill or elliptical. I love that the classes are included in the month to month membership-no contracts too!
1,"This is among my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The Queen Charlotte roll is my personal favourite. It does get extremely crowded at nights so If you're at the bar, ask for Stephanie. She is a solid bar tender who will make you smashing special cocktails that aren't on the menu. Enjoy. \n\nBut be prepared to buy more than 3 tapas per person or you will spend a lot and leave hungry."
0,I give two stars for a decent wash. I got the basic wash it was 14.99. As soon as you pull up they are trying to upsell you and get you to replace your windshield. Even when they were giving me my car back they tried to get me to have my leather seats detailed. I find this very annoying and if I shouldn't have to say no thank you more than once. I had to ask to have the marker they write on your window washed off. They also missed bird poo that was on my door. My door handle was broken prior to going in but they hid the handle under my seat and when I asked where it was they tried to say it wasn't there when I arrived. I don't like being called a liar. Will not return.

1,"Fish and Chips anyone? Had that and the quesadilla last night, both were delicious, but i'll admit I feel a little sluggish today. Place was clean, well kept, nice waitress. We went on a quiz or trivia night, so the mood was pretty mello. Tap beers seemed pretty standard for a pub. I will definitely go back for a nightcap as it is an easy walk from my house."
0,First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.
1,"Now it is my turn to write a review! I had my appointment with Paul! He did the most amazing tattoo in memory of my brother, Darryl. I had to incorporate my favorite thing as well Hello Kitty. His imagination & expertise to it to another realm & exceeded beyond my wildest imagination. Well worth a months rent, lol. Thank you to every one there for being so incredible & wonderful! I LOVE this place!"
1,"This place never disappoints :) always looking forward to this place when we fly in from Hawaii, and it's the guaranteed spot to go to on our list :) and the people remember us :)\n\nEvery time we went there we had great service :) this last time we went was the first time they got out orders wrong lol, we ordered Hamachi nigiri, but instead the lady brought us Hamachi collar x) wasn't a bad thing, cause we decided to just eat it, and now we have another favorite on the menu to order haha :D\n\nEveryone should come here atleast once :) and you'll be coming back again and again for more ^_^\n\nThanks again Sushi Mon!!! See you guys again next year! :)"
0,"Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \""better\"" treatment. \nWe showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful. \nThe \""waitress\"" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \""wow she is so not personable\"". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \""yes\"". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group. \nNeedless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday."
1,"Amazing food! Have been here twice. Very intimate setting, good service & great food. \nGarlic & spinach Nan was so yummy! So is the chicken tiki masala."
0,"I went here because it was 3am, I had been sick for almost 24 hours to my stomach and wanted some answers and/or relief. I don't have insurance so I was trying to do the responsible thing and avoid the ER. I took a cab all the way there because I don't have a car and I was the only one there when I got there. I filled out the paperwork and about 10 minutes later they brought be back. The doctor took almost an hour to come in. Keep in mind my belly was killing me and I was nauseous. Basically he told me they couldn't do any tests and that I should just wait it out or go to the ER. He seemed annoyed when I asked questions. He wrote me some prescriptions and I had to wait for awhile in the waiting room to get them. \n\n\nFor the only 24 hour facility in Phoenix, I'm really sad that they can't provide better service. I'm going to my regular doctor today which I should have just waited to do so."
0,My buddy and I have been there a few times. It's a good location. That's about it. The happy hour food is subpar. Drink prices are alright. It's usually pretty open so that's why we go there. Then again with the poor food and lackluster service that could be why.
1,"Excellent food, excellent service, good decor...it's a win all around!\nFour of us enjoyed dinner at Wazuzu this past weekend, and we didn't stop raving about it all weekend long.\nThe sushi dishes were delicious...very fresh ingredients and different than any sushi we've had before (and we eat a lot of sushi here in San Diego).\nThe drunken noodles were a huge hit! And don't miss the crunchy roll! Amazing!\nWe also had the pleasure of meeting Jet, the head chef, and he was very nice and thanked us for coming in. \nOverall one of the best dining experiences we've had in Vegas and we can't wait to go back!"
1,I had a peets coffee and the bread n pastries smelled awesome...off strip find... I will have to go back to indulge in the pastries and update accordingly...
0,"Where do I start... Oh yeah. The people watching at this place is wonderful. The abundance of tweekers and crackheads is amazing. With that aside, it's a Mcdonalds! That's all I have to say about the food. The service was not good at all , the staff seemed overwhelmed with a small lunch rush. My order was missing a hamburger ( the main part of one of the meals I ordered), an apple juice (part of a kids meal) and cup for one of the drinks. They did fix it quickly. Oh there was an employee in the dinning area making the floor super sticky ( I think she was mopping with a mop bucket that had cleaned up a spilled soda, just a guess) so that was nice. So I would definitely would not recommend you try this particular McDonald's.  In and out it's just across the street."
0,Went for lunch. Wife order Cobb salad. I order prime rib open face sandwich. Slow but food finally came. Wife looked salad and said no eggs or avocados  waiter said they were out. I could not cut prime rib with steak knife  did bring another. Worse than first. Left hungry
0,"Not that great.  The build up by others was just to big for them to live up to I guess. The beef is dry aged with good potential, but they sear the meat.  It needs to be grilled on flame.  The sides choices are limited and tired.  Wine list was great though.  The staff seemed to be focused on their regulars vs other guests.  Bill was over $250 for 3 which in itself is not outrageous, but the overall experience was poor.  Too bad, as the locals really push this place."
0,Management here SUCKS! They would take a to-go order by phone claiming they're too busy. Taking a look around they're not busy at all.
0,"It's such a shame really... I used to enjoy going to Howies Restaurant, enjoying there changing menu but I have to say that when I went last week I was quite disappointed with it all really.\n\nI should have known that it was going to be less then a great evening when we ended up seated next to the doors to the toilets, surely it would make sense to screen this off or have a whole other door to the them as the last thing either myself or my dinning companions wanted to see while we were eating was the loos, kinda puts you off of your meal a little bit.\n\nThey also had everyone squeezed into the same side of the restaurant for some reason, so we were left having to scoot our table even closer to the loos when the table next to us was filled and there was little room left to maneuverer on one side of the table.\n\nHaving received a bowl of bread with not quite enough in it to evenly share out and even less butter we all ordered from what looked like a rather good menu.\n\nI went for their tomato and crab soup which tasted mostly of pepper and was served so hot that my bowl was still steaming when the other people in my party had long finished their starters and i was left trying to conquer my molten soup alone. I have to say I was very disappointed by the soup as i love fresh crab but feel that it's sweet flavor was just lost.\n\nMy hope was now resting on my main of pan fried tuna, but again I have to say I was already concerned as when i had ordered it i had asked if it came still pink in the middle, which I have to say is one of the best ways to have a lovely fresh piece of tuna, but the waitress looked at me like i was speaking another language. So when it arrived it was safe to say it was very much cooked all the way though, but to my surprise that wasn't what shocked me the most. What really got me was the fact that it had a huge piece of bone in it. Now I have eaten tuna, a lot, in various places and I have never ever been served a piece with a huge bit of bone hanging of one end of it, in fact it looked more like a pork chop. It's saving grace was that it actually tasted alright and wasn't as dried out as it looked.\n\nAll my hope in a nice dish was gone by this stage and the pudding didn't fail to disappoint either as i was promised a chocolate and cherry fudge tart, but the cherries must have been misplaced some where as, while the chocolate was lovely and not too rich, there was not a hint of cherry in the dish at all. And strangely it was accompanied by a raspberry compote, is it too much to wonder why they didn't do a cherry one? Perhaps that would have helped to draw out the flavor of the cherries that where hiding somewhere in all that chocolate.\n\nI just feel that maybe Howies have become a little complacent, I do remember having fantastic meals there and the service was good enough to match. Maybe they need to do something to reinvent themselves, they certainly need to find themselves someone who can fillet fish properly.\n\nHowies is definitely somewhere that I will not be in any hurry to go back and visit, there are just so many other places that do what they try to do so much better."
0,"I switched insurance a couple years ago and needed a new ppo doctor, this office was the one my gf used.  From the start, I had bad experiences with this office.  I was never assigned a doctor and always given a random doctor or nurse.  I have 2 different tests done that required 3-5 business days for results.  Both times I did not receive a call back after 10 business days and had to call more than 2 times for my results. \n\n My biggest complaint however comes from my last visit.  On that day the office had a \""$50 see the doctor sign outside\"" the office was absolutely packed with people that did not have insurance.  I waited for 45 min before I sent to the back and waited another 45 min.  I finally left because I had to go back to work.  I paid $25 for the visit and was charged a $50 \""no call no show\"" fee.  They would not remove the fee from my account.  \n\nThis office is ran extremely poor starting at the front office.  Even without my latest issue I was ready to change doctors.  I would not recommend them to anyone."
1,"So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \n\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!"
1,"I love the Bellagio! I stay here every year for a week-long work conference, and look forward to it all year. When I come out on vacation and stay with friends, I always end up here for a drink, or to play a little Blackjack.. or even walk through the flower display.\n\nThe Bellagio hotel has more people staying the night every night than the total population of the town I grew up in. Seriously. It's a great place to sit and people watch (I recommend one of the comfy chairs by Jean Philippe's Patisserie.) The fountains are a must see.. with shows running on a regular schedule to a changing music selection.\n\nBellagio.. it's the definition of Vegas!"
1,Went there last night and had the meatloaf.it was very good. The service was good and the staff was very friendly and engaging.
1,"Five guys is a great alternative to fast food burgers without getting mixed up in the world of \""gourmet\"" burgers. Their burgers are very tasty and are available with a huge list of free toppings unlike most places at this level. Get some free peanuts while you're waiting for your order? Yes please. Although I enjoy the burgers, I think the fires are worth equal mention. They come in regular and cajun variety and I've never seen anyone who actually needed to order a large. The regular is plenty, even to share. The menu is pretty basic but they do have a hot dog and a grilled cheese option for those who aren't into burgers. I will say that for me it is kind of a toss up between Five Guys and In N Out, but I seem to find myself here more often."
1,"Excellent!  Love this place. My former \""go-to\"" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.\n\na. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.\n\nb.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.\n\nc.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.\n\nd.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.\n\ne.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. \n\nI love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great."
0,I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though.
1,The food was delicious. Got the red curry with beef. Wife got fried rice. We'll be going back.
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE KA! =D\n\nVisually stunning, amazing and wonderful acrobatics, colors, music and costumes. The whole show was really fantastic and it was great that there was a storyline. Although it could be a little difficult to follow at times, the scenes are really amazing. One of the best shows I've seen in Vegas and it definitely competes right up there with Cirque's O. I have seen Love and Le Reve and I don't think they were as technically amazing as KA. The theater itself is impressive enough and the show blew me away.\n\nA few things to note: \n-The show is about an hour 45 minutes (totally passes by so fast!). Don't go on a bathroom break! You'll miss stuff. \n-Bring a jacket, because it does get cold in theater.\n-Look EVERYWHERE. The sets are designed for all the seats in the theater.\n-Look for deals on great seats! When I went I saw a promo code on travel zoo for 30% off orchestra seating. It was a great deal and we had really great seats. I've never paid full price for Cirque tickets because there are usually deals on every one of their shows. \n- Check for seating online and by telephone. I also called in and spoke with someone to book my tickets to the show. They gave me better seating then the ones I found online. So it's good to do both to snag better seats!\n\nKA is soooo good that I would totally watch it again. =)"
0,"NOTE: A duplicate of a review of this place under a different name.  Just noticed that this place is listed under two different spellings: Grand Canal Cafe and Gran Canal Caffe...\n\nAt first glance, it's a charming little \""neighborhood\"" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.  \n\nOnce inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.   \n\nBut I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.  \n\nWe had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.  \n\nThe service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.  \n\nOkay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a \""neighborhood\"" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.  \n\nWe might go back, but I'm not sure..."
0,I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.
0,I gave one star because the food was good.... Service terrible. My husband and I went out for our last date night for a while before welcoming our son into the world. We were seated quickly and a server introduced himself because our server was busy with a big party needless to say we had FOUR different servers which is ok but our appetizers bread and entrees came out within 5 minutes of eachother. Frustrating to say the least then the server came by and asked if we would like our filets put under the heat lamp while we finished our appetizers both of us enjoy our steaks medium rare/medium so a heat lamp is deff not a solution. \n\nI'm not one to complain but if I am going somewhere spending over $30 a plate I'd enjoy not being rushed through our entire meal. Will not be returning anytime soon.
1,"Not bad for a local fish fry.  I had Steve's platter and the portion was plenty for each item.  The wife had a two item combo and had more oysters than anyone could assume in one setting.  The kids enjoyed the kid menu items.  We had about a 25 min wait that was not expect, but went fairly quickly as they moved consumers in and out quickly."
1,"The servers there Kenny, Joe, bus-young man David, are excellent, efficient , knowledge about the flavors etc on menu.  We (3) had the enchilada plate, #10 plate, and tostado plate, each plate was 2 meals in one.  The flavors are very mild, so I could enjoy the flavor, and NOT the spice, it was EXCELLENT! We go after church, extra hungry, so we are really are very happy to get it the food hot and FAST! The restaurant itself is clean and open. You can NOT beat the price there and the food is INCREDIBLE!  Good menu selection.   Great portions.   This will be \""OUR\"" to go place on Sundays!"
0,"My first time at FarmerBoys, just so so. The Pastrami sandwich was good as was the milkshake. The onion rings on the other hand, were terrible. The cracked corn coating was very thin and fell right off \n\nHad to wait in line after being served to ask for mustard and a fork. This was a 5 minute wait for items that should be readily available for customers. \n\nNot sure if I'll be coming g back."
0,Great place. BUT horrible service. Although it was a game day Sunday and it was full they only came by 2times to check if we were ok and needed something and every time we asked for something we got a different server!!!
1,Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.
1,"went for restaruant week.\nabsolutely fantastic.\nthe filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.\nthe creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. \nthe staff are very professional and friendly. \natmosphere compliements the entire experience.\ni hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!"
0,"Not worth the time, much less the price of admission.  The VIP package doesn't add anything of value.\nIt's a colorful game of waiting in line, dodging small children. The \""training simulations\"" aren't calibrated, so you can't play them without encountering more glitches than hits, making the 40 minute wait that much more bitter in hindsight. \nThe registration was broken, so we didn't get several of the features of the expensive package or any of the personalization that is supposed to be a feature of the whole Experience itself.\nThe opening scene had to be restarted several times because the audio and video didn't sync up.\nThe room transitions were poorly managed, with a bored looking person in a SHIELD t-shirt letting the music play a few loops before pressing the button to open the doors, making for a really engaging and immersive time, imagining you're in training for an actual government contract job, waiting for the instructor who is running behind due to a pile of paperwork and red tape.\n\nDon't waste your time, money, or sanity."
1,You will not find more honest business people than the owners of Select Glass. They stand behind what they say and do. I will do business with them again and again.
0,Get the chicken teriyaki bowl and skip everything else. I just got the tempura and teriyaki combo for lunch. The tempura was a carrot and a zucchini i think. Then some long thing with a shrimp tail but I don't think shrimp are pencil size. There was two CA rolls that were marginal but they do not give you ginger or wasabi. Wtf?\n$10.82 for lunch just not worth it. \nThey need more lunch specials.
0,"I ordered flowers through ftd.com  this company was suppose to handle the order.  On Valentines day FTD and I tried to call to find out where the order was, NO ANSWER.  The next day when I spoke with them the excuse was that they were busy it was Valentines day.  Really who would of thought that would happen.  They never delivered the flowers, even though everything was at a premium.  STAY AWAY"
1,"I love French cuisine!!! I am so happy I found a home cooked French cuisine in Charlotte. I am so happy I finally experience this place! My first impression as soon as I walk inside the door, I instantly feel warm, cozy and right at home. We had an early dinner on a Saturday night, probably the third table to be seated. The hostess immediately sat us at a very corner of the restaurant with a window view to the outdoor garden patio. My back was against the wall sitting on a very long wooden church bench, a pew. Within 30 minutes, the place was packed and the tables were filled up.\n\nI was hungry and saving my appetite all day. I proceeded to order a chicken liver salad that came with a nice warm poached egg on top. I also ordered a glass of risling. The moment I took my first bite, my palet were opening up to total heaven!!! It made sitting on the church pew feel  more heavenly. By far, one of the best salad I had in Charlotte! (True meaning of Yum Salad. It is a famous salad in South East Asia). If I can lick the juice of the plate, I would. Luckily for my date, the waitress brought the spoon for me to scrap every juice of the dressing left on my plate!! YUM!!! By this time, the French owner came over and introduce himself as Fabrice! Very nice guy.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the duck breast with artichoke, cooked as the chef would recommend. The duck breast was plumb and juicy, slightly more cooked than what I was used to, but it was still delish! The cream sauce was slightly heavy for me as I took my time sipping on my merlot chatting with my conservative attorney date who was not too familiar with French dining. He ordered overcooked steak and french fries! Bless his heart!\n\nI love this place and  the location which is close to uptown and on a trendy mixed cultural district of Charlotte, Central Avenue!!"
1,"Please don't hate, but I like Chipotle... Sure it's owned by McDonalds, sure it's not authentic Mexican food, but still it's very tasty. Nothing special about this particular location: it looks like any other Chipotle restaurant (maybe a little nicer?). The nice thing about it, though, is that I get the same burrito that I would buy in NYC for $2 cheaper..."
1,"This aint your basic grocery store. Actually, to tell you the truth, I did not really start coming here until this cookie butter craze took off. \n\nThis last visit, I was actually there to get some Mac n Cheese in the frozen food section because I have had some at somebody's house before and it was just brought up in a recent conversation (Yelp Talk strikes again!). \n\nIronically, there just happen to be some Speculoos Cookie Butter available on the shelf. Since I already had the regular cookie butter at home, I got the Cocoa Swirl this time. I was a bit surprised that there was any Speculoos at all since people pretty much grab all of them as soon as the store opens up.\n\nIf you are not in a rush, I recommend you take your time shopping here because not only will you discover new things, you will also learn that the employees here are very helpful in anything that you might be looking for.\n\nBesides your basic grocery items, you will find that TJ's carries other things that even the major grocery stores don't carry. These guys might not be the biggest stores, but they house a lot of goodies that people come here specifically for. Things like various nuts, vegetables, spices, pickled items, chips, etc. \n\nSo get on up and check this place out any time you pass by one or are in the area. Stock up on some goodies!\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #41"
1,Everyone there is so pleasant.
1,Ok I gotta stick up for this restaurant ... Seriously people need to stop with there bitch fits... I'm glad I don't listen to others.\n  So my bf and I just moved to the neighborhood and I love Chinese food so for lunch today we ordered from here... Man on the phone extremely nice order showed up in less then 30 min like he said... Food was scorching hot and delicious :) take advise from someone in the food industry and order from dragon wok!!!!!!!
1,YES YES!  Do wish they brought back the jalapeno mashed potatoes! But every time they rock my world with the goto FISH TACO!!!!!
0,"I gave this restaurant 2 stars because my husband's main course, (Gigot d'Agneau) was wonderful -- but mine, (Steak Frites) was awful. (I rarely do this, but in retrospect, I should have sent the dish back.) Not sure what happened here, since it is a simple and classic preparation -- but I needed a new, sharper knife to cut the meat and, even then, it was a sad and tough thing, permeated with connective and vascular tissue. A nice pink hangar steak, it nonetheless was flavorless and disappointing, served with a pile of unremarkable frites that were saved by truffle bits and oil. That said, our first courses of Beignets de Fleurs de Courgettes, Salade de Tomates and P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne were all delicious and beautifully presented. Also, a good word needs to be put in for our server, who was attentive, warm and knowledgeable in every respect, including wine recommendations. He brought us a complimentary pineapple-lemon tart, a nice gesture, but far too tart to eat beyond a few bites.  Reading all the other reviews here, it seems we hit on a bit of bad luck, but since there are so many dining options on the Strip, I doubt we will return to Bouchon Bistro nor recommend it."
1,"My wife is very particular about the noodles she enjoys eating and this place delivered. Not only did it delivered on the noodles, China A Go Go has very good tasting food. I had the lunch special, orange chicken with Chow Mean and Rice - DELICIOUS. The service was fast, always a plus in my book.\n\nI did not have a Yelp account and hardly review anything any where. I had to do it for China A Go Go. This is going to be a definate stop every Vegas trip.\n\nThank you China A GoGo!"
1,"I love this lounge/bar. It's a unique place in Vegas - it has a view to die for, the music is excellent and you can actually carry a conversation with minimal \""what did you say's\"". Most bars in Vegas are too dark (ie:Caramel), but Ghostbar was perfect. The crowd is fun and its a large enough of a place to.....errr.....hide and its a small enough of place to locate any lost friends. I make sure to make this place a \""must go to\"" venue in Las Vegas"
0,"This show was awful.  I've been to many Cirque shows and I have no idea how they allow this show to exist.  There were minimal acrobatics, just a lot of toplessness and bad jokes.  That's $88 and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back."
0,"Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained, wanted to wear flip flops in my room. Towels scratchy. They need to raze it and start over."
0,"Expensive, glorified bar food and crappy server. The view was great though, right across the Bellagio fountains. Be fair warned, food is mediocre. They need to really fix this place up. How disappointing."
0,The food was not all that.  The customer service was just okay. Don't get what all the rave is about??
0,"Visited with my family, 3/15/2012. Service was horrendously bad. Food was disgusting and  WAY overpriced. Over $140 for a lunch for five.\n\nAn establishment whose chef has appeared on Top Chef should be serving food that is, at the very minimum, edible. At best, the experience should be something I want to remember and enjoy. Unfortunately, not the case here.\n\nHow does one screw up a Caesar's salad? What the hell is a Caesar's salad doing on the menu at a MEXICAN restaurant, anyway?\n\nFurthermore, don't let me believe at the front door that I'm going to find Meican food on the menu, when in fact, you're serving Central and South American food, with no mention of any of the Mexican food standards.\n\nAll in all, a thoroughly unenjoyable, disappointing experience."
1,"From the street this place looks tiny, but make your way down the stairs inside or the (slightly) rickety metal steps down from George IV bridge and you'll find an elegant dining room where they serve one of the best lunch deals in Edinburgh: a starter, mains, and two sides for about seven quid.\n\n\n The food is upmarket without being pretentious; and if I can't speak of their desserts that at least tells you the portions are more than hearty and didn't leave any room to try them! My companion qualified her starter of tomato and basil soup as pretty much a meal in itself.\n\n\n Very good service too in formal yet relaxed surroundings. Don't watch the large clock on the wall and let your lunch hour go..."
1,I eat here all the time you get alot of food for a good price. The teriyaki chicken is very good. There macaroni salad is the best I've tasted out of the few island places I've had in the area. The crab puffs are also very good.
0,"I have them such a glowing review before. \nI am really disappointed.\n\nEven though my first customor service rep was wonderful, this time I got a really rude lady named Tracy.  I just did not like the way she talked to me so much so that I just didn't even book a second trip.\n\nThere are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now.  Companies cannot afford to have the worst customer service.  I did call  Detours.  They were quite helpful."
0,"I lovED this place so much, I forwardED their 20% off promotion for lunch to my whole department, I strongly recommendED all my friends, family, and clients this place, that's why I have to write this review.\n\nI came to this place for Happy Hours and dinners. Always a pleasure especially the dinner on Thursday, 12/26/2013. The holiday special: Surf and Turf (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs) and lemon base seasoning sea bass WERE phenomenon!!\n  \nI therefore took my friend who loves fish and seafood here tonight and ordered the same things. I called before we arrived to make sure they still serve (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs). Before I ordered, I confirmed with our server, Barry, for the sea bass. Barry told us sea bass is always on the menu.\n\nI hate to say that, but the fish was chewy and definitely not sea bass. I showed Barry the picture I took last time as I am a Yelper and never skip the picture of good food. Barry was not attentive and told me next time just to show the picture first and the kitchen will make the same fish. -- If it's a dish always on the menu, why do the costumers need to show the picture to make sure getting the same food and quality??\n\nThe disaster hasn't ended. The steak was way too raw that we didn't even finish a quarter. The king crabs were warm in most of part but with dry and FROZEN part. \n\nOur server, Barry, only had 3 tables at that time, and he spent 98% of his attention on one person of one of these 3 tables. After I reflected him about the fish and showed him the picture and after he witnessed the untouched steak, he just avoided my table!! Barry apparently doesn't care about the clients like the previous servers I met here before.\n\nThe only right thing for tonight is the food runner, RIGO, who is awesome, professional, and much more attentive than Barry. RIGO greeted every table he served, made sure the guests were satisfied, and RIGO was the only person who asked us about the untouched steak. -- Thumb up for RIGO!!\n  \nI am not going back to this place no matter how much I lovED it when there is no consistency of food and welcoming service. I have better way to spend my $100 + bills."
1,"I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu"
0,"My husband and I went to see Jerry Seinfeld at Comerica. First problem is that while he stood in line for beer, I had to stand in another line for liquor. And turns out, the line I was standing in wasn't even for liquor, but beer and some other random malt beverage. The liquor line was on the opposite side from the beer - it would be nice if people had a little more info.\n\nThe bartender that was running the liquor portion was ridiculously slow. I mean, so slow the wife of the guy in front of me left to go stand in line at the bathroom and came back before their drinks were made. OMG.\n\nThe seats are super tiny, very close together and pretty much have zero leg room. I'd hate to be tall and be sitting there. I wanted another drink but I didn't want to get up for fear of having massive leg cramps and not being able to walk back.\n\nOur view was decent, however the sound quality was terrible. Every time someone would talk into the microphone, it would echo all over the place and so we were listening to each joke twice."

0,"I set up an appointment on WAHOO because my finger nail Got torn back and pulled out, after waiting and arriving they refused service. He said \"" I  dont remove nails, go to the hospital.\"" What's the point of an urgent care if they refuse Non emergency treatments. Since I had to choose a rating they get one star instead of 0"
1,Amazing food! Went there for my first time and food was fresh. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Mexican food & have had a lot but this place is awesome! The service is great & fast but the seating is not quite roomy. Although it didn't stop me from enjoying my food!
0,"I can't write about the food, because I left before we even got sat. But we got there at 6, and at that point, it was a potentially an hour wait. We had issues with even giving the hostess our phone number. I walked away thinking that I wouldn't even get called due to the fact that she kept getting our number wrong. Sure enough, after 40 min, we went back to see how long the wait was, and she apologized. She apologized that she called our number and it was the wrong number. She would seat as soon as she could. That turned into another 45 min. We joined a group of people leaving for the same reason. The wait. I'm sure the food is good, but I didn't get the chance to try it. We went to Anthony's and got sat right away. Great food. Great service. The only thing was the selection was minimal for $25. Even Sushi Mon had a better selection for $21."
1,Good guacamole and the carne asada was very tender. Good salsa.
0,"Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah..."
0,"Wow, things change really quickly over in Chinatown. \n\n1st time I came here, I had such a good time that I gave this place a 5-star review. After my last 2 visits..Now, I gotta give it only 2 stars. \n\nThe staff was rude this time around. Very anti-social and easily irritated. \nThe staff was constantly making fun of customers behind their backs. Calling them all types of degrading names and making fun of their hair, clothes, etc. I found their behavior to be very out-of-line. \n\nFood was still really good. So they get 1 more star. \n\nI don't understand why this place attracts such a shady crowd?  People all around me were loudly talking about sexual topics, drugs, and screaming profanity in the air.   I really don't mind that atmosphere because I use a lot of profanity myself, but this place is designed like one of those fancy 5-star restaurants, so I would expect a more upscale crowd.  Infact, I enjoy that kind of atmosphere when I am at a  dive-place like \""Ellis Island\"" or downtown, but \""Pho Kim Long\"" is a fine-dining establishment with it's giant neon fish tanks, marble tables, and chandeliers. I know I am in my 20s, but I have a lot of friends who are 60+, and one of my friends is actually a former civil rights activist from the 1960s. I felt really  bad having a man of his integrity have to sit there and listen to drunks and typical vegas-trash talk so much sh!t around him.  \n\nThis sucks because now I gotta find another 24 hour Pho place. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know."
0,"I had them twice now (about 6 months apart) and actually ordered the same items (as their photos of their other items werent very appealing).  \n\nI ordered their grilled cheese with hot dog/sausage.  I liked the idea of the sandwich more then actually eating it.  You would think after eating it the first time and not enjoying the grease of the oil coating my mouth, that I wouldn't subject myself to eating it a second time (even if it was 6 months apart) - I blame my fiance! \n\nI rather make this sandwich at home where I can control how much oil/butter to use just to make the bread toasted... toasted bread does not mean you need enough oil to grease your mouth and your fingers..."
0,Hair in our sushi. All servers with their long hair down? Not fresh. Not good. Won't be back.

0,"We (party of 6) stopped in after my son's graduation for an early dinner.  Just before we stopped at Starbucks for an iced tea.  My mother still had her iced tea when we walked in and the bartender immediately said that we could not come in with the iced tea.  I asked to speak with his manager and he said \""he will tell you the same thing\"".  We walked out and went across the parking lot to NYPD and spent $125 on dinner & drinks and had great service.  I will NEVER come back to this place.  *** Update *** Following is a message sent to me from what was obviously an employee of APC:\n\nWell not to be rude but it is against the liquor laws to have outside food or beverages In a restaurant and I know first hand there is a sign outside the door there that states it. So if you get mad at a restaurant for following the rules then you are not a customer that restaurants want.  Tara S\n\n* Just another reason to never go back and to make sure I tell all my friends and family about the experience."
0,"Diablo's was a Disappointment!  I wanted to have a relaxing dinner and a few drinks with a few of my colleagues from work.  We decided to give this place a try since none of us had ever been here before.  To our surprise, the service was terrible and slow, the appetizers were the greasiest things I've ever tried, and we were so put off by this place that we actually didn't even order dinner.  Not to mention that we were sweating bullets in our seats, I get that LV is hot but crank up the air for your customers.\n\nWe were seated promptly by a hostess at the door since we had a reservation.  We were a party of 12 and they had a nice big table set-up for us.  The waiter then didn't appear to take our drink order for at least another 10mins.  Then he didn't come back with our drinks for another 10min.  We knew we were in for trouble at this point so we ordered our appetizers quickly since we assumed there would be a wait.  We waited about 20min. before we saw our waiter or our appetizers again.  At this point we were 40min. into the meal and hadn't even been asked if we wanted an entr\u00e9e.  We all agreed to eat our apps. and get out.  30min. and a burger joint later, I finally got to eat dinner.  \n\nI'm sure this place is a good place to grab a beer on the strip but don't go here with expectations that the food or service will be good."
0,"5 years ago when I lived in this area I love the Montana Meat Company.  Sadly, that has changed.  I have dined there twice within the last month and it seems everything has gone south.  Food quality, food portions, service, speed, friendliness... all have grossly deteriorated.  Montana Meat Company is now on my personal list of \""never again's\"", which is not an easy task to accomplish.  If you are in the area and looking for a decent steak there are few options, other than Giuseppe's on the weekends or the Summerlin venues which are a bit further of a drive."
1,"Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)"
0,"I have to tell you that it pains me to give the restaurant by this name such a crappy review rating. I have been to two others of these in southern California and they are both 5*s in my book (and everyone I go there with every time I go down to visit). So, maybe I had high expectations. But no, I think they truly earned a 2. They may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me. First impressions are SO important. \n\nWe went on Friday morning pretty much during peak breakfast time for most that do not get up at the crack of dawn. It was about 930am. We fully expected a wait for breakfast and as we suspected we had one. The young man functioning as host had a rather unique method. He did not write anyones names down, he just tried to remember who was who and in what order, even as people filed in. I guess it seemed to work ok as we did not hear any fights and got seated in a timely fashion. (Thank goodness for being a party of two and being able to sit at a little table.)\n\nI knew ahead of time what I wanted to order, though I was concerned that it would be too huge for me, would take a long time to cook, and my leftovers would have to sit in the car all day. I ALWAYS order the apple pancakes. They are my favorite. I just love them. Even if they take 30-45 minutes to bake and are humungous. Imagine sauteed apples with a pancake/cake batter poured on it with lots of cinnamon, baked in the oven. Yes, its sooo good. Usually. I was quite happy to see that they had a option of a Junior apple pancake, smaller version of the same goodness I usually like. They should all do this.  SG ordered a regular egg dish, which also comes with some pancakes. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, my pancake arrives. BURNT! So, if I had gotten it about 5 minutes earlier, it would have been perfect? Ironic. I thought it would be ok, but I could not eat the charred edges, they just were too burnt. Steve's meal took another  5 minute to come. My meal is the one that takes forever and then its like they forget the other order. I noticed this at the neighboring table and blew it off until it happened to us. They need to time things better. My food would have been cold if I was polite enough to wait.\n\nOur service was also pitiful. I had to get up and get the syrup from the bus station myself. Coffee refills were few and far between too. But, we were headed to a ball game, so we probably did not want to have too much coffee on board. I did notice the service at the neighboring tables with a different waitress appeared to be much better than ours, but I can only rate our experience. \n\nWe will likely not be back here. There are lots of breakfast options elsewhere and I can save my Apple pancake as a treat for Socal."
1,The pastries are works of art .... We almost hate to bite into them since they are all so beautiful. The croissants are delicious also. I have suggested this bakery to numerous friends and EVERYONE has been impressed with the beauty and quality. A true GEM!
1,"My boyfriend and I were apartment hunting in Ohio for a week and Brenda was an enormous help in taking care of Mo and Mew. She came to our home, even though it was a little out of her service area, and made sure the girls were fed, walked, and played with. Brenda is fast on her feet and even noticed some things that we had forgotten to take care of before we left. Her communication skills are awesome and I felt like I knew what was going on at home while I was away. She even sent me a text on one of the first days of her visits to let me know that Mo and Mew were doing great. I really feel like my fur kids couldn't have been placed in better hands."
0,"I went to this restaurant once before and had an enjoyable experience. I realized that most of the experience consisted of alcoholic beverages, so this may have clouded my judgement. At the time, the restaurant also didn't have very many people. Tonight most restaurants were crowded, so we decided to come here. I ordered a grilled salmon plate, and it was okay. I love salmon, but left wishing for more flavor. Most of the vegetables were onions, which I thought was a bit odd. Even the fried rice was bland. This restaurant has a tepan section, so I was anticipating flavorful rice. I would give this restaurant a solid okay. On a positive note, the servers are very friendly."
0,"If the room had been cleaned properly, this hotel would have easily earned another star. I would consider staying here again, but if the room is not clean I will take the time to complain and get some of my money back. I added some photos I took of our room at this hotel that might get taken down so let me describe them for you: One photo was of the carpet in between our bed and the nightstand, which was dirty and some of the debris included a glowstick (how do you miss that?) and a pretzel. If you don't clean up food it attracts bugs! Which leads us to the second picture, which was of the top of the nightstand and some disembodied insect parts i found there. Mostly legs. It was gross. Also there was a long hair dangling from the lampshade by the bed. CLEAN your hotel rooms! This hotel would be great if they hired a competent housekeeping staff. Location was nice and the amenities were just fine, but for the state the room was in I would say that I definitely overpaid."
1,"I love this place- esp. the breakfast. I started out with a Fat Boy bloody mary. It has bacon. And string cheese. Yum. I ordered the crab Benedict and it was delicious. My dining partners ordered the Denver scramble and prime rib hash. Both said their meals were great. We ended the meal with cookie dough egg rolls. They are evil, but soooo goood. My usual favorite dessert is their 6 layer carrot cake. One thing to remember is that the wait on Sunday morning is long. Do not walk in and expect to be seated in less than a half hour. They have a lounge area where you can get drinks while you wait which makes the time go a little faster."

My two kids loved it and it was clean. \nThe third time we visited we showed up at 10:30am (they open at 9) and there was no one there, no lights on, no sign on the door. Three other moms and their children came at the time I was there and we took our business elsewhere.\nThis was just a start to the unprofessionalism.\nI noticed on their PUBLIC BUSINESS facebook page that the owner seemed to get into a dispute....a rather rude dispute... with several customers. They posted a random post about Andrea Yates killing her kids then refused to apologize if it offended anyone and basically that they didn't care and didn't need your business if you disagree.\n I can overlook a lot of things when it comes to a business, but blatantly disrespecting others and being unprofessional is where I draw the line. \nBottom line, We enjoyed playing there the couple times we went, but good luck going during business hours when there is someone there. And don't like them on facebook unless you want to be disrespected. PlayGrounds in Peoria will be getting my business from now on even though it's twice the drive."
0,They ran out of CHICKEN!!!!!!  Had to wait 20 minutes. Nuff Said. \n\nMichael was the manager btw. I vote for him being the worst manager of all time. Do I have a second? \n\n This location should be named Kentucky Forgot Chicken
0,"Horrible service.  \n\nCould not understand the clerk taking my order, then of course it wasn't what I wanted.  The clerk then tries to blame me for the mistake - what???  \n\nThe person making my drink acts like it's such a pain to make what I wanted.  Then, she makes it wrong again anyway, so I just had to walk away, with no drink, or else many awful things may have come out of my mouth!"
0,HORRIBLE customer service. My sister and I went there after having no success at finding a brides maid dress from David's Bridal. No one greeted us. After browsing for 10 minutes I finally had to find someone to help us. I told her what we were looking for and she just brushed us off. It was a terrible experience. That alone caused them to lose our business. They get 2 stars because the dresses were beautiful and they had a decent amount of accessories to chose from. I would never suggest this place to anyone.
1,"Went here for my birthday with my family.  On all accounts, it was amazing!  For one, Scottsdale has needed a good tapas place.  Now we have it.  The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and funky, and the food is fabulous.  My mom loved the chips and guac.  The guac was nice and limey.  My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.\nWill definitely be back."
1,"I did remember two things that bugged me. \n\n1. No free Wi-Fi.. I expect free these days\n\n2. The fountain in the kiddie pool  is like a well with water coming out. Kids are attracted to it and naturally they are going to climb on it and play with it. The life-guard kept yelling in our direction every-time a kid started playing with the fountain, which happened often. \n\nKids that age don't know that a life-guard is yelling at them. You can't really hear what they are yelling anyway because it's too far. I figured it out by body language in that when a kid got on the fountain the guard was focused on him/her whistle in hand.\n\nSo either let kids play with the fountain or remove it. What did you think kids were going to do?"
1,"We went here after golfing and all of us though this place was great. We're from Phoenix and only wish this place was closer. Service was very accommodating and attentive and the food was fresh, hot and very delicious. Prices were right too! The next time were in the area, we would return for sure."
1,"It was awesome, service is what you expected from this type of restaurant.\n\nThe atmosphere was very differant and fun.\n\nI hope they are around for a long time to come."
1,"Was in need of a serious hair cut and beard trim and my brother recommend that I go here , Freddie was the barber who cut my hair and everything came out clean ! great service , great vibe, definitely will be coming back to this barber shop , would really recommend to anyone , these guys know what they are doing !"
1,"My family and I have been coming to Lush Burger often over the past few months. Our experience overall has been great. The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is consistent.\n\nThe lunch special is 2 dollars plus the price of the burger you order. I usually get the Lushburger classic (normally $8) with sweet potato fries and an iced tea. I like my hamburgers medium to medium well, and Lushburger delivers. The sweet potato fries are fantastic, and you can get the iced tea in a giant to-go cup to take with you after you leave. So for $10 I get a great meal. Sometimes my mom and I even split it.\n\nYes, the burger is pricey. But in North Scottsdale, it's pretty hard to get a lunch under $10 that isn't Subway or In N Out. And you can only eat at AJ's and Wildflower so many times. I tried the new BluBurger location at the Summit (North Scottsdale and Lone Mountain) but was not impressed. Around the same price but the atmosphere and quality was lacking."
1,"How on earth have I not reviewed this gem! Do not be fooled by outward appearances.  It is very unassuming but once you get inside, it is a beautiful steakhouse.  They have not one but TWO happy hours!  My friend and I come here to spoil ourselves.  $30 each for a nice steak a side and glass of wine. They have a fantastic wine list and a steak to please everyone.  They will cook it any temperature you want...including gag..blue :)  But if that's what you like, you can find it here!  Be naughty and get the cookie sundae.  Ooey gooey chocolate chip cookies covered in creamy vanilla ice cream.  You're welcome."
1,"I am a busy man that needs instant gratification when it comes to lunch delivery.  This place gets the job done!  At other locations, I've accidentally had an ingredient added or chips forgotten... They always correct their wrong!  Whether it is running you what they had forgotten (5 minutes or less) or giving you a credit for the next time you order!  It's fast, fresh, convenient and I have never experienced any negative customer service.  Keep up the good work!"
0,"Please take note: This is the first review of any type that I have ever written.\n\nKitchen 56 reminds me of a movie.  Of course, I will have to qualify that statement, but first let me say the following; in all my years of eating out Kitchen 56 gave me an absolute first.  In an attempt to be hip, if an 'open kitchen' concept can be considered as much, they offered me a glimpse into their inner workings.  What amazed me and my girlfriend was they weren't - working - I mean.   Each 'chef'   was inexplicably  staring out over the dining area, seemingly without a care in the world.  Now this place must seat 120 people with 3 'line cooks/chefs' so either they were incredibly good at their jobs or there was more to this story.   Unfortunately, before I could ponder this any further, we were seated and promptly attended by Sarah.  She was certainly the highlight of the evening and thus, through the act of choosing drinks and placing our order my previous observation evaporated.  Then the food arrived.   It was now that my previous observation bubbled back to the forefront.  The math is pretty simple.  Three line cooks + 120 people = multiple micro-wave ovens (which doesn't have to be a problem - or does it?).\n  \nI had the pork (tender)loin, which it wasn't.  It came with potatoes, which technically they still were, but not for much longer.  These things tasted like they had been re-heated, refrigerated, re-heated and refrigerated for about a week.  So in my attempt to eat those things, I inadvertently saved a complete stranger from a similar fate.  \""I took a potato for you!\"" (bravo for my good deed)   Alas, Kitchen 56 staff will be forced to make another bushelful  for next week's victims.  No I don't mean patrons.  (too harsh - Monday and Tuesday probably patrons, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday - definitely  VICTIMS!!)  So one way or the other, everyone wanting to eat potatoes at Kitchen 56 will get an opportunity! \n\nI know it seems a little insane to talk about the potatoes, but here is the rub, my girlfriend's Mac and Cheese was prepared with the same loving care!  So here we are, full circle and Kitchen 56 still reminds me of a movie.  Remember a time when you couldn't wait to see a certain new release?  You know the one, the one you never saw because David Edelstein or Roger Ebert reviewed the film and said that \""__________(fill the blank with your favorite star) was sleep walking through his/her performance.   Guess what? KITCHEN 56 is that blank.  Wow!  And a last word to those guys staring off into space, the ones standing behind all that fancy commercial cooking equipment pretending to be cooks, don't let the door hit you on the way out.   \n\nNow it would be all well and good to blame the cook staff and they must shoulder most of the blame.  But I have to ask who is testing this menu?  I won't even start on the small salad (oh alright - fresh and easy - rinse before eating)  \""What we have here is a failure to communicate....\"" or maybe \""This is a trickle down economics problem.\""   Be it a movie quotation or political rhetoric, either way..... Kitchen 56 you are a 1out of 56."
1,Everything on this menu is awesome! The cucumber salad I highly recommend!!
1,Our favourite Japanese rest in our neighbourhood.  Small place.  Nice sushi and sash ini selection.  I enjoyed Udon noodles there last time I went...but the Tempura was a bit on the soggy side.
1,"Good ribs, amazing hot links and service with a smile!"
0,"I remember having a great experience at the Mandara Spa a few years ago so I decided to make an appointment for a massage during a recent voyage to Vegas.  Unfortunately, that experience didn't happen this time around.\n\nMy Swedish Massage was $115.00 for 50-minutes but with a 20% service charge added, it came to $138, which is not bad.  My massage therapist was great, he had me sample the different oils that they use and asked about target areas.  Although, he didn't work on those target areas longer than I had hoped, it was a nice massage.  One thing that irked me little was when he used his arms on my back, I could feel his arm hairs, which kind of felt like sand paper but no biggie, it's a guy thing.\n\nThe spa itself has significantly gone downhill.  The lounge area used to be a little more plush, with nice seating and furnishings.  Now it has three microfiber couches, a coffee table and a side table holding a huge 32\"" tube tv and a VCR...yes, a VCR.  Their beverage station offers lemon water, hot tea and in the mini refrigerator, there's a bunch of mini cans of juices, but no bottled water.  Apparently, they keep the water behind the counter.  Hmm...doesn't juice cost more than water??\n\nThe sink area offers your basic amenities, nothing fru-fru that's for sure.  It almost feels like the sink area at your local gym.  You know, kind of stale and industrial feeling.  The restroom area is out in the open so you can hear (and smell) everything.  The showers are in a separate room/area, which is very dimly lit, but the shower stalls are private.\n\nThe hot tub is pretty huge and can fit about 22 people, so the sign says.  But it looked quite dingy and could certainly use a good scrubbing.  The cold plunge is the size of a normal hot tub and was quite cold!  In the same area were the Sauna and Steam Room...which smelled mildewy, nothing minty or eucalyptus smelling like it should be.\n\nThe spa staff was alright, they were on the young side, just out of high-school type.  So, they were nice but, not quite refined for the atmosphere.  One of the guys who I thought was restocking the refreshment area, was actually standing there and texting until I glanced over at him.\n\nMandara or Paris needs to revitalize this spa because with all the other awesome hotels and super duper new awesome hotels around them, they're just going to fall way behind."
0,"This place is fine, but I think if I ever go again it will be because it is the only thing in its area that has late-night food. Otherwise, I don't think it's anything special for regular lunch or dinner hours. It's not bad, but I don't think it knows what it wants to be. Food is good enough: hot beef sandwich, vegetarian burger, calamari, fries. Everything was fine, just not really \""special.\"" The best thing was the small side of coleslaw, in my opinion. There are many other more exciting restaurants in Madison. That said, the prices were reasonable, and the place isn't pretentious."
0,"took my sis and the kids here for a quick bite after shopping and i was very disappointed.\n\nThe location is like any other RR in cleanliness and atmosphere, your basic family friendly sports bar.. but this visit was just terrible.\n\nThe waiter forgot half the stuff we ordered, brought mixed up sides, and a wrong dish all together... took forever and then the manager came and corrected everything after we had to wait...\n\nWe were very specific about a couple of things, like the temperature\n for the little ones food and it was ignored.\n\nDining with little ones is always an adventure no matter what you do, so it helps if the staff understands and does their best to make the process painless.\n\nI probably won't come back here."
1,"So far, the best part of my traveling day! Valet parking is included, so I just drove up to the front door and someone unloaded my luggage for me and parked my car. I walk into the lobby to register and there is NO line to register! The clerk was as nice as can be, answered all my questions without seeming put upon, explained my package (more on that later) and reminded me that the bottled water in the room frig was FREE, can you believe it, FREE? And they have some great packages. Mine was $75 a day which included breakfast each morning as well as a $25 pool credit, drinks or lunch at the pool. I had to look pretty hard to find this package but it was there, offered by the hotel on their website. I really like Las Vegas. But I don't like the long lines to register and the worn out rooms in the hotels on the Strip. I have a new hotel when I come here. The room is beautiful, a King bed with quality linens. Two comfortable chairs and a small lounge area. I rode the elevator up with the housekeeper for the floor and as we got off the elevator she said to me, \""Welcome the the Aliante. If you need anything, please call me and I will get it to you!\"" OMG! OMG! After the fiasco at Fox Car Rentals I feel like I have arrived in paradise."
0,"I don't know why the comments about the donuts here are good.  For me, it is gross.  I bought an chocolate donut when I pass by, $4.  It is super oily and greasy.  Very dense, too.  The chocolate topping is made with chocolate , butter and walnuts, I think, very greasy,too. And the donut itself doesn't taste much,  Neither salty nor sweet, quite plain. I shared with my husband to see what's his opinion, turns out he just took a bit and the rest went to the garbage.\n Won't go back again."
0,"A casual American restaurant located inside Mandalay Bay is a great option for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\nThere is a to go bar to order off the limited menu, which has sandwiches, salads, juices and coffee. I dined in for lunch on Saturday and the service was horrible. It was not busy at all, yet the waitress was very slow to take our order and to deliver the check.\n\nI ordered the mushroom bleu burger, which is exactly how it sounds, a burger with bleu cheese, mushrooms, jalape\u00f1o, lettuce, onion and tomato. It is a bit pricey for a typical burger that did not stand out.\n\nI would try this place again and try another dish with another server, but it didn't give a lasting first impression. I recommend it to hotel guests not wanting to leave the hotel, but there are other restaurants in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes including another burger joint."
1,"Freed's Bakery has amazing options to choose. Special occasion Cakes, Birthdays, Weddings and a lot more. The designs are amazing and they have skilled designers to create anything that you request. They also offer cookies, pastries, holiday treats, ice cream and more. They are pricey but with their perfection I  wouldn't expect nothing less. Also the staff is very kind and willing to let you sample a cookie if you are nice. Oh yeah and there known around town and the world."
0,"I had lunch here today with family from out of state.... They had a friend with them that is a big Harley Davidson Fan..  The restaurant is decked out in Harley D,,, well duh,,, but its nice,,, they have motorcycles on lifts that continuously circle the whole restaurant...  They are the previous yr's model that are for sale, so 2011 are in there now but will change in june..  \nWhats with all these chain place, like Planet hollywood, Chili's, Outback etc... All the food at these places taste the same regardless of where you go... GHAK... I ordered the BBQ plate for 2, included one free starter which we got the spinach/artichoke dip,,, ehhhhh marginal at best... the plate included  pork ribs, bbq chicken, smoked sausages, pulled pork, and i think beef brisket with corn on cob and 2 sides.. served family style...\n\nSausage-  pffffft,, spicy but not very good\nRibs- were decent,, on par with ribs at fridays, chillis, etc\nPulled Pork-  decent nothing to write home about\nchicken-  best meat on the plate, juicy tender but still ehhhh\nbrisket- total fail if it was brisket/ tasted different than the pulled pork so i dont know\n\nOther plates at the table were a\n\nburger--- ehhhh \nfrench toast- looked good,\nturkey wrap- nice sized, but who messes up a wrap..\n\nAll in all,, decent place to go if you have guests in town and want to see another typical Theme restaurant and in the immediate area, buy a drink skip the food....  Hope this yelps.\n\nPS... they added a 17% gratuity automatically,,, i thought this was odd especially when it was just 4 adults and 2 kids one being 16months.... didnt notice till i looked at it outside... i figured,, the waiter made 32% gratuity on us..  Also, to park behind the place is 10 bucks, but they will credit you 10 bucks with your parking tix..."

0,"Horrible and very slow service and they messed up my order. They were not crowed either. Ordered a Cobb Salad and server brought me the wrong salad then tried to ask like it was right- left off bacon, cranberries, and walnuts. Had shredded cheese on it which it doesn't come with. Wrong dressing on the side! Server wanted to bring me bacon, walnuts, and cranberries to add to my own salad. Why not bring me the lettuce too. Why not have me go in the kitchen and make my own! Will not be back to this one again!"
0,"The House of Tricks is aptly named. They have a box full of \""tricks\"" to get you in the door along with many to make sure that you don't return. \n\nDon't be fooled! This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!\n\nI made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of \""no service\"". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!! \n\nTheir overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any \""wow\"" from the food. The only \""wow\"" you will get is when you see the bill!!\n\nIn this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!"
1,This is the best sushi place I've ever been to! The food is amazing and the service even better! The prices are great and they have half price sushi all day weekends and after 5pm during the week!!!! There are so many amazing rolls for you to try!! I have been coming here since 2010 when I used to live here!! Every time I visit Vegas which is about 7 Times a year I always come here!!!
1,"Kind of like Japanese tapas (Izakaya?), you can get all sorts of interesting small dishes, like orange salmon canapes, oishii lobster (our favorite!) - including strawberries and served with shrimp chips, and many others.\n\nIn a city with a bad reputation for sushi, Oishii manages to put together a very interesting and solid selection of quality dishes, and is still reasonably priced, at least in 2010.  Definitely a neighborhood go-to spot, and at the same time unique enough to please visitors to the city too.  Definitely to be recommended.\n\nGreat for groups too, as they have a decent amount of space, and I think they have 1/2 price cocktails on Thursdays."
1,"My girlfriend and I thought the show was great. It was really entertaining, and if you're fascinated with magic and illusions, you'll love the show. David Copperfield knows how to involve the audience and has a great sense of humor.\n\nThere were only two, slight downsides. I wish the theater/seats were better. I sat at a table with chairs near the stage, and they aren't positioned very well, so you might need to turn your head/body away from the chairs back rest. However, if there is room, you can move the chair so it's easier to sit directly facing the stage. They are 'doable' but I would love to have been in a theater with better seating. This doesn't take away from the quality of the show, though.\n\nThe next was the fact that the drinks were really weak! We ordered their 'large' size, premium drinks, and they were really watered down.\n\nOverall, a great show!"
0,"This airport is only coveted for the destination that it leads its fliers too... the view of the Strip is the only thing that redeems this hotel. The tacky slot machines in the center of the terminal is one thing, but they dont even have a smoker's lounge (its vegas for god's sake!) There are not that many options for food at the airport. Also, it is a TINY airport with a lot of traffic and THE TRAFFIC LINE OF DOOM in itself is a catastrpohe. To its defense, you can drink while you are in line, which i saw many people doing."
0,This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.\n\nBe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream.
1,"Food was excellent! Service not so good. I had the Kalbi  burger & the wife had a Bachi burger. Both were excellent, but a little under cooked for what we asked for. The kim chee on my burger was just right, not over powering. We went on a Monday evening. There were 8 tables occupied & 3 servers. I had a beer & we both drank water. The water was filled once & the napkins we asked for when the food came never arrived. That was the extent of our servers attention. Beer & water were dropped off as she took our food order, she dropped off the burgers. That was it. The manager brought the appetizer & we had to ask him for the check after we finished eating, after waiting 20 minutes. Don't recall who filled the water, but wasn't our server. I do recommend this place as the food was great. I will give them another try."
1,"My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!"
0,I want to start off by saying I didn't attend the Luau. I stayed at the IP during a very big convention and couldn't find rooms anywhere else.  I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.
0,"I had some pretty high expectations for this buffet and i was disappointed. For the price 30 per person on a weekday and considering this buffets' location i expect better. The food was just OK. Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price."
0,You get what you pay for. Police where called to the room next to me. The rooms had a nice modern touch to them overall was a nice look however I did get bit by a bug while I was there.... Not cute.
0,"As far the the check-in process went, it wasn't bad, but  no one was really pleasant. After we were issued our room keys we began what seemed to about a 15 minute walk to our room. Our particular room was the absolute farthest from the elevators, so it was a loooong time. \n\nNow on to the room condition!\n\nThe bathroom tub and floor were dirty, I didn't want to even walk around barefoot or step foot in that tub.We had a broken phone, broken lamp, dirty shower curtain.\n\nAfter seeing how dirty the bathroom was and seeing how our lamp and phone both didn't work, we immediately decided we didn't want to spend a night in this place. I immediately went back the front desk to check out. I explained the condition of the room to a different women at the front counter. She too was rude and unaffected and unapologetic and had to go \""see what she could do\"" in terms of refunding me my money. Horrible service, filthy rooms. Take your money elsewhere where it's appreciated and your room is clean\n\nI ended up getting my $150 refunded and walking down to The Venetian where I was warmly welcomed and given a 30th floor suite for $170."
0,"We (8 friends) have been coming to this restaurant for several years during our annual Vegas trip. The service and food are always great. Not anymore. We reserved a specific table 3 months in advance. When we got to the maitre 10 mins before reservation time he said he would not seat us until the whole party was here and by the way \""you need to be aware that we need to sell the table again so don't take too long\"". Incredible. He would not sit 4 of us (the rest were shopping for a few minutes) AND he had the gall to tell us to hurry up once we sat. This at a place that typically sets us back at least $150 per person. So our table sat empty while the rest of the party arrived (15 mins). Of course we had told the maitre that if he sat us before the rest arrived we would start drinking and eating. He still refused. When he finally sat us, I politely thanked him and asked his name. His answer? \""What is YOUR name?\""  I gave it him and he just looked at me, refused to say anything and left. This is truly apalling service for any price level. Clearly these guys feel like their full house (and mostly tourists) justifies them giving unacceptably bad service. Spend your money somewhere else, where they will actually appreciate it.\n\nPost-meal update: The stone crab legs were ok and the King crab was amazing. Mac and cheese always great and two people said they would come back just for the banana cream pie. Our server, JJ, was funny, nice and professional. As usual, after countless crabs legs and bottles of a really nice white, we paid ~$150 per person and would be well worth it except for the maitre'd interaction, which really soured us on the place (I upped it to two stars because of JJ and the great food). The owner has contacted me, which is always a good sign of managers actually caring."
0,"Well just having spent the past weekend at the valley Ho, it was interesting to compare the two hotel concepts and restaurants . Both being old outdated hotels remodeled into somewhat trendy urban hot spots. I walked into the lobby and was pleasantly surprised by the decor. Artsy in a \""raw\"" sort of way. Exposed ceilings, cheap local art for purchase on the walls, a view of the really cool pool area, then walked into the \""gallo blanco\"". I was 1 of 2 people there. I sat at the bar\nI sat down and scanned the menu that was on the chalkborarded walls. The server handed me a wine list. I had vino blanco from Argentina. It was ice cold and served in what appeared to be a Riedel \""o\"" glassware.I  Liked this. Things are going well at this point. Then I ordered just one Fish Taco. I wasn't real hunger so this small taco was the perfect size. It was served on a small corn tortilla, the fish was halibut and it was nicely grilled. If I ordered it again I would have them hold the white sauce that tasted like \""miracle whip\""?? the fish was so fresh, it would have been perfect with just the avocado, and lettuce. Conversation was going fine with the server unitl for some reason he asked my age, which I thought was odd. then from there the conversation digressed into some political and philosophical debate?? I was just looking to unwind with some vino and food and to relax. I guess I may give Gallo Blanco  another shot to try some other things on the menu, but I would probably bring a friend along next time, and avoid the politics :)"
0,"No thank you. I don't like sounding like a snob or suggest that it is not possible to run a successful Japanese restaurant if you are not Japanese, but this place is horrible.  These folks aren't Japanese and their inexperience with the food shows.  The sushi rolls are very sloppy and loosely rolled, the crab is not crab, but Krab... Fake for sure.   The worst was the yakitori. Don't bother, because it is really a teriyaki shishkabob with broccoli and squash. The meat was over marinated and under cooked.   Run away and don't look back, there are plenty of authentic places around that don't cost any more than this place and will give you real Japanese food. The only thing Japanese about the place is the beer.  Very disappointed and won't bother a second time."
1,"The museum also has an area that is filled with really cool shirts/posters/cutouts/etc that are reasonably priced. The museum itself is definitely worth the $5 to view- a nice trip down memory lane!! I've been in both the museum and the comic book store. Both are cool and both times an amazing associate named Pierre was working. Seriously, if you want AMAZING and KNOWLEDGABLE customer service then Pierre is your guy!!"
1,"Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.\nIt was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.\nI don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night.  \nLunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  \nDon't go looking for the lobster.  Go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!"
0,"After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:\n\n\""Its coming out, wait.\""\n\nAfter 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.\n\nNO GOOD."
1,"Our first \""attack\"" straight off the airplane was a trip to Le Village Buffet as recommended by Christine T.  We arrived in Vegas close to 9AM.  We dropped off our bags at Ballys and proceeded to Paris.  Line was short since it was around 10 when we got there.   I LOVE breakfast, it is my favorite meal of the day!!!\n\nFor some reason, these chefs knew exactly what my favorites are, as if they were cooking for me!!!  LOL! Bacon - nice and crispy, exactly the way I like em, hashbrowns and red potatoes with herbs and stuff - I just have to get them both.  Eggs, scrambled all fluffy!  I could list more, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I mean EVERYTHING, even the COFFEE was brewed perfect! Not too strong or too weak (for me, sometimes the coffee can make or break the breakfast place).. \n\nWhat put me over the top was the made to order crepes!  I ordered a crepe with banana and nutella with drizzled with chocolate syrup. Thinking about it makes me salivate. ha ha\n\nI love the decor of the little town!  I think it is so cute!! Our waitress was very attentive. She knew exactly when to check up on us.\n\nI know there are TONS of buffets in Vegas, but I will have to come back to this one.\n\np.s. dont forget to try the bread and brie (I heard it's the BEST) but I forgot at the time (so I'm writing this now so I won't forget next time).  :)"
0,"Walked out. Went with a group of five for breakfast and the owner said that \""big groups should go to Eat-n-Park. We're just a little cafe.\"" I suppose our money wasn't good enough. If you've got three or more in your group, go to Hanlon's Cafe just down the road."
1,"I've been coming here as long as I can remember; at least 10 years. The best service ever. I can go to a restaurant that charges three times as much, and invariably leave thinking that I would have received better service at Lang Van. As previous reviews on here state, they remember every dish you have ordered, and are genuinely happy to see you. Or they're just darn good actors. But so many other places don't bother to put out that kind of effort.\n\nSure, Pho Hoa has better pho, and nothing compares to the profuse amount of tendon that is in Vietnam Grilles tendon pho.  While I do wish they would give you lime instead of lemon, I don't really come here for the pho; but do order it when it's cold. Having said that this past visit the pho was much better than usual, with a roasted onion flavor that I really enjoyed. The soup arrived quickly and hit the spot.\n\nThe best dish they have is the lotus root salad; it is the perfect summer dish. Roasted pork and shrimp served on top of some kind of puffy rice cracker thing, with lots of crunchy lotus root. The rice cracker things are light and crispy; the perfect amount of food; you don't leave feeling like you have overdosed on carbs.\n\nHere's to another 10 years!"
0,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
1,"The Spring Rolls are a definite must have!  As for the noodle salad it was flavor-able but mainly noodles and greens.  I would love to go back for the soup which is what they specialize in.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the pork, it was too dry for my taste.\n\nIf your in this neighborhood and looking for a new spot.....give'em a chance. \nREMEMBER to bring your cash.....cash only!"
1,Service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations! Leak soup by far one of the best soups I have ever tried. Very unique food but good
1,"The moment I saw this food shop, I immediately thought of the movie Ms. Doubtfire, and felt this must be the kind of store to get food one pretends to have cooked! Everyone's happy and none the wiser.\n\nIt's the only store of its kind I've seen in Edinburgh, and I'm not surprised it's located in Bruntsfield! A La Carte prepares meals, which the customer buys frozen and the menu is really quite extensive. They do soups, poultry, pork, meat and vegetarian dishes as well as desserts, and whilst there are some fancy meals such as fruity moroccan lamb and leek filo tarts, a lot of the dishes are surprisingly simple and homey. Macaroni and cheese, shepherd's pie and meatballs and spaghetti are on the menu and capture the spirit of what most of the other dishes are like. I would personally make a lot of these meals myself rather than pay for them, but I guess some people go for this sort of thing.\nWhat excites me more about A La Carte are their baked goods, which are fresh each day! They do scones, cakes, bread etc, which I'm more than happy to buy."
0,"Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend."
1,Food is good and this place is pretty convenient for us. We're here every couple weeks. Service is usually pretty good. Can get a little busy at times but what else would you expect. We won't be coming here nearly as often though. Just found out they switched from Coke to Pepsi. Doesn't work for us. Would still recommend for the food.
0,"This was the asolute worst service I have ever used in my entire life. This will now be the fifth time they are coming to fix my windshield and I doubt they will even show up. The first time, they brought the wrong windshield. The second time there was holes in the seal so there was squealing every time I drove. The third time the holes in the seal got WORSE! Then the fourth time they never showed up, and that was after the manager promised me it would be ready by noon. I feel terribly sorry for any person that chooses them in the future. This place needs to be shut down."
0,"I have stayed here a few times before, but many years ago. It has steadily gone downhill.  They now charge the much-hated \""Resort Fee\"", which is a sleazy way of hiding the true cost of your stay. They also charge for internet access. VERY slow internet access. According to Cox Comm they have very old equipment at the Stratosphere and do not want to pay for the upgrade.  A 25 year old analog TV has a better picture than the TV in my room. I got my revenge by doing ALL my gambling and eating elsewhere. So the $27/day charges for Resort Fees and internet access was all they got. The other big downside is that all the action happens further down the strip and cab fares in Las Vegas are outrageous."
0,"There is nothing i liked about this place at all, I came here because it was close by and had good reviews, however I am not sure why it does. I shared  four sushi rolls with my sister and only sort of liked one of them. One had so much mayo on it I felt like I was just putting a spoonful of mayo in my mouth (I think it was called the super spicy roll.) It is also a very tiny place. Tables are so close together it makes it uncomfortable to talk to the person you are dining with... also it took a very long time to get our food soooo yeah I would not go back!"
1,"I agree with the positive reviews of this spa.  I had a massage there last week, and it was very clean, and the massage was great.  I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back.  Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward.  My feet were in heaven for over a day!  The price was great.  I will be back, and bring friends with me."
0,"If you are coming for breakfast or a burger and fries and a shake, this is your place.  I have tried 2 of the regular meals, the ground round dinner and the smothered chicken.  I had to send the smothered chicken back because it was floating in water and the green peppers on top were pickled peppers that had a sweet taste.  Not a good surprise.  This is not the place to go if you are a healthy eater, which I try to be.  I normally can find SOMETHING healthy on every menu,  but this food was too greasy and strange tasting.  The only reason we went there was a buy one, get one meal free coupon.  The servers, however, are very friendly and helpful."
0,"I had high hopes for my return visit to Olives. Several years ago I had a lovely meal at the restaurant while staying at the Bellagio, but was disappointed with my most recent dinner. \n\nService was both rushed and inattentive, with a sense of urgency to turn the tables coupled with an attitude that more than suggested \""Why bother, we'll never see these people again.\"" Staff wanted to take our meal order even before presenting the menu.\n\nThe foie gras served with my meal was delicate and properly seared. I wish I could say the same for the filet, which - ordered rare - was served over-cooked, dry, and completely unseasoned. Staff were nowhere to be found after dropping off the dishes, so there was no one to run interference with the kitchen.\n\nTodd English, your staff at this outpost can and should do better with both service and cuisine. The Bellagio Hotel & Resort positions itself as a 5 star establishment and purports to have restaurants of the same caliber. Sadly, this spot is letting them down."
0,"To whom it may concern,\n\n\nI have recently stayed at the Venetian for my 21st birthday. Their customer service was terrible. First, I arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed. I removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge. Then I realized that I would have gotten charged I immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened. The following day  I was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and I called the front desk again to ask for someone to come up to check.  Also, there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay. My boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments. We made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us. We were not informed anything about refreshment \""restocking\"" fee.  On Sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 5:48am and still did not get them until I finally tired of waiting for them until 6:45am outside my room. I went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room. Finally, Sunday afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments. This was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived. We were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of. I have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off. I am really upset with the customer service that I have dealt with this past weekend. I left to come back home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill. I called today to try to find out how much I was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question. Then I have called the Venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived. He was very understanding about our situation, but wanted to run through the manager. At first the manager stated that I was informed many times about the $50 restocking refreshment fee, but that is totally false. They argued that they have it on their notes that I was informed. Then they tried to say that I stated that I had the drinks in the bathroom. I have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom. I am very upset with the way Laurie/Lauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when I asked I wanted the person's name that made the note that was informed because I wanted to get them fired. What kind of service is this? I had to call back and ask for her again and tried to get compensation, but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that. I am very upset with the Venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications. I want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager I had spoken with had claimed that I was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that I had made statements that allegedly admitted \""facts\"" that I had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.  This experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.  I have never been this upset to make a formal complaint, but based on this experience, I will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that I know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again."
1,"We ended up at Komol when we couldn't get into Lotus of Siam and it turned out to be a satisfactory alternative. Komol is a Thai restaurant in the same shopping center as lotus of Siam. It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good.\nWe started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut soup. This is always so different in so many restaurants. There was lots of spicy red powder floating at the top of this soup. They're pretty serious about the zing here at Komol. I can't really rank it among my chicken coconut soups. It might be near the top. I have to have it again.\nThen came the beef salad, which for me was the only disappointment of the night. While the beef was tasty, several pieces were really tough to chew. The tomatoes also seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that ripen on the truck on the way to delivery. \nThe two entrees we split were both excellent. I ordered the mixed seafood in panang curry and it was all good. All the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked. The curry had great flavor and precision. Ted ordered the beef basil in a brown rice and it was also nicely done with a great mix of flavors. \nCorkage was $5 a bottle."
1,"Just got home from dim sum with the family here. I come here for dim sum about once a month. It's one of the better dim sum places in vegas. The line can get pretty long, so we try to come around 11am. Today the line started getting long just after 11:15am. \n\nThe food off the dinner menu is good too, but the portions are small. Salt & Pepper Frog Legs is one of my favorite dishes here. Yup. I said FROG LEGS!! Soft like fish and sorta tastes like chicken."
1,"My husband and I stopped  at Sugar & Ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am.  The food and drink were a little pricey, but good.  I had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall.  It was relaxing, and a great way start off the morning."
1,very affordable and delicious filet mignon for only $32. will come back again!
1,"After stumbling through various Japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, I've finally found a place that specializes at it. In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\nI started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.\n\nMonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. I wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but I could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity."
1,"Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\n\nAwesome.\n\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat."
0,"Have been going to this place for about 2 years because it was close by and had decent food.  The wait staff has always been extremely great and very pleasant.  Unfortunately I will never go to this place ever again and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  Their food has gotten extremely bad...too much salt on the all breakfast food and everything else is not cooked properly.  They just put out a new menu and raised their prices by over a dollar.  Pretty sure he did that because of his other failed businesses...a mortgage company that tanked along with other real estate investments.  They don't take reservations...or I was told that when I called to make some.  So we showed up an hour early to get a good seat for the football game.  I sat at a table and then I was told to move because someone had reservations.  So we moved to another table.  Then at this table we were told to move again because of reservations.  Then we finally got a table in their back room.  So we were all watching the football games and enjoying our overpriced food and watered down drinks.  Then with about 5 minutes left to go in the game we were told that we had to leave because someone else had reservations at our table and the Owner and Manager didn't even have the guts to tell us this themselves.  They made a tiny 19yr old girl come up to 10 guys to tell them to move.  She started to cry because she felt so bad to tell us and still no help from management.  Completely classless establishment.  We offered to share our table but they wanted us to move somewhere else entirely.  If that wasn't enough, my wife and her friend were out on the patio getting some air and over heard the owner talking badly about us using profanity all over. What a classy man talking about the people who keep him in business.  What's the funniest part of everything.....the people that wanted the reservations weren't even eating or drinking."
0,":( So sad about my two-star rating... This used to be one of my favorites spots to eat. They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!"
1,"OMG THE ABSOLUTE BEST! If you're ever in Vegas and on the strip, stop by Cosmo and GO TO HOLSTEINS. \n\nOur waitress was impeccable and the best. I wish I'd gotten her name because she deserves a raise!! Best customer service ever!\n\nPROS: \n-burgers were cooked to absolute perfection and to the way we wanted.\n-shakes were to die for. foodgasm to the max. \n-fries were crispy and perfect.\n\nOverall, it was one of the best hamburgers I'd ever tasted and the best experience all in one. No doubt whenever I'm in Vegas I will make a stop at Holsteins!"
0,"This place is a disappointment. It took 2 hours to get my pizza, when they told me 45 minutes to an hour. I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes, and I was his only stop. It took another 50 minutes to get to my house. I live about 10 minutes away. When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours, it was cold. When I put it in the microwave, it wasn't even good warm pizza. The Pizza was okay at best, just not worth a 2 hour wait. I will avoid this place going forward. Pizza Sola is way better!"
1,"Just got back from trying the lunch buffet at Taste of India, which was pretty good and a definite value.  It is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  The buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  Today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  There were also gulab jamuns.\n\nMy favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  The chickpeas were good, but I thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (I am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since I have an awesome recipe that I make at home all the time.)  The watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  Total for two people came to $17 before tip.\n\nThis is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is Children's Hospital staff.  Parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  But I really like this place and it's definitely worth it."
1,"Feeling a little home sick for Hawaii, I decided to dine with my hubby at L & L located at the centennial shopping center. As we walked in, the smells of teri chicken took me back.  They had music in the background , which was Keahiwai singing Push.\n\nThen, the Hawaii themed counter hits ya with all the local fav combos on the menu.  The Korean lady cashier was very friendly and quickly took our order.  \n\nBefore we knew it we had our plate dinners.  I ordered the Kalua pork with cabbage and teri beef and my hubby ordered the curry chicken katsu.  For dine-in guests, there is refill drinks.  The combos came with, one scoop rice and mac salad.  The mac salad was in a small plastic container, not like in Hawaii, which is placed next to the rice.\n\nMy combo was tasty, but the strips of meat were too big, and the cabbage was not sliced thin enough.  My hubby's combo was tasty too. The curry chicken katsu had a good tang and too spicy.  The portions of food were plenty in both combo plates.  I tried their  and it was kimchee good but the cabbage slices were too big. \n\nIt was nice having familiar food like on the islands.  Overall all, I liked the food and the prices.  I would definitely return to this location for a quick bite."
1,"I've been to Petite Maison twice, and can't wait for the right occasion to go back again! It's a beautiful little place that's perfect for a date. I've sat both inside and outside, and the decor is warm and the restaurant cozy. \n\nThe service has also always been impeccable. The first time I came here, I was a complete French food novice. It's a little bit intimidating. Our waiter was very kind in explaining everything, all with a rather fantastic french flair to the menu names. Being female, I lapped it all up with gusto. \n\nBut the star of the show has to be the food. Oh man, the food.\n\nIf you're not squeamish about raw beef, do get the steak tartare. It was heavenly. I'd never considered eating beef raw before, but it was silky, the raw egg lovely, and it went perfectly with the chips provided.\n\nI can't remember the cocktail I got the first time, but the 2nd time I got the La Poire, and it was sweet, very pear-like, and very strong. Their drinks have some kick here, so if you're a lightweight like myself, come prepared with a designated driver.\n\nThe first time I was here, I got the salmon with the fried poached egg on top. I was in LOVE with my dish. I used to state that I preferred to eat my salmon sashimi style, as I've encountered one too many butchered, overcooked salmon fillets. This shattered that stereotype. The haricot verts were fresh, buttery, my salmon cooked perfectly, and my favorite part had to be the breaded poached egg on top. I didn't even know what it was until I broke it open, and yolk ran all over the plate. I can assure you I was quite ecstatic upon that discovery.\n\nMy girlfriend got the poulet roti - boursin stuffed chicken breast, pomme puree, wild mushrooms. I do remember us liking it, but can't give any more feedback than that it tastes good!\n\nThe 2nd time I went I got the duck, on the bed of truffle risotto. The duck skin was beautifully seared and crispy, and the truffle risotto aromatic and rich. Upon recommendation by our bartender/server, I added the foie gras on top as well. I'd had a bad experience a LONG time ago with foie, but had nothing but good experiences here at Petite, so I decided to give it ago. Boy, was I glad I did. The foie was INCREDIBLE, and likely my favorite part of the dish. It was seared on the outside, and so silky and melt-in-your-mouth. I'm salivating just thinking about it. \n\nThe BF got the pork loin over asparagus sauce, and he loved that as well. Between mine and his I genuinely prefer mine, but I'm a sucker for truffles, risotto, and that incredible foie. \n\nYou also must NOT consider leaving Petite without getting the souffle. They're pretty upfront about this, but put in your order early as it take about 15 minutes to come out. It's always been timed beautifully, so that we get it not long after the plates have been cleared. The waiters will break the souffle and pour that grand marnier creme onto it for you with much relish, and that sauce is so good I could lick it from the bowl and drink it from the little saucer by itself. Fluffy, warm and light, it's a little slice of heaven, right there. \n\nI love this place. It's easily my favorite restaurant in the valley. A little on the pricier side, but not out of reach. It's a very good date place, but don't bring giant groups here. The space is so small it impedes groups of more than 4."
0,It was okay. Nothing crazy. I mean all you can eat crab legs and oysters was my highlight.
0,This buffet sucked! You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet. The Rio and Mirage buffets are still far better than this dive. The design and atmosphere is simplistic and strange.  They could have made this place much more Romanequese. It may have been named after a Roman God but the food and atmosphere wasn't even good enough for mere mortals like us.
0,It ok not worth all the hype. No space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again .
0,"Experienced the worst customer service here yesterday. It was crowded and lot of cars waiting to have their car wash off when this guy knocked to my window. \n\nemployee: Hey did you pay?\nMe: umm what?\nemployee: I said did you pay?\nme: yes I did pay\nemployee: ARE YOU SURE?!? are you really sure you pay? \nme: the F*** here is my receipt \nemployee: Well somebody didn't pay. There are four cars when its supposed to be three.\n\nHe walked off without giving an apology.  \n\n*Note - He only talked to me, he didn't talked to the car drivers in front and behind me."
0,"My husband and I were invited by friends back in November 2012. At first we really enjoyed it, then started noticing unprofessional attitude by the owner, such as alcohol on the breath, and shouting at the staff in front of patrons. \n\nThe owner's claims that former patrons just \""hung out\"" without purchasing anything is erroneous and inflammatory; furthermore, these patrons are personally responsible for bringing in many new customers.\n\nI fully expect to have the owner remove this negative review; that is his prerogative. However, just know this...word gets around Marco."
1,"We really like this place.  The bartender introduced herself, and shook our hands!  We started talking about the beers they had.  So we decided to go with there special beer....I can't remember the name of it.  But they don't have it all the time. The brew master was present, he introduced himself to us as well, and the hubby and him started talking beer.  We tried a sample or 2 of the others, but didn't care for them.   As long as they still have the one we were drinking we will be back.\nThe menu looked pretty good, our hearts were set on something else for dinner.  But this was a nice change of pace.\nBefore we left, the bartender started telling us about there happy hour....SAY WHAT!  $2.00 beer....I'm not talking about Budweiser!  Premium beer 20 oz!  Yes, you will see a check in tomorrow!  lol"
0,"I really wanted to like this place because it's a 5 minute walk from my house and I like coffee.\n\nI had a pour experience.  I felt completely out of place here and I got that look from the barista the, \""You sure you're in the right place \""look. :( that can really hurt a girls feeling.\n\nThe barista dropped the espresso tamper on the ground and then used it to make my coffee with. Now I am not a germ-a-phobe by any stretch of the imagination but I do believe that a customer should be treated with dignity and some common courtesy, anyone, anyone???\n\nMy boyfriend and I dined here together right before we left on vacation. When we got to Buena Vista Coffee there was only one other patron in the coffee shop and only one other person came into the be served while we were there for 20 minutes. \n\nI always like to dine at a near empty establishment, because I reason that if it's not too busy or crowded the server, cook, barista what have you can focus on doing a good job and not feel rushed.  \nWell the opposite was true for my  visit to Buena Vista Coffee even though the coffee shop was completely empty the barista treated it as if there were a line of 30 customers behind me. Nothing necessarily being impatient but completely detached in that hipster sort of way. That if you're not a hipster can be pretty bleeping annoying.\n\nThis is me ranting!!! \n\nFirst by dropping the instrument where the espresso beans are tamped and then by serving me a breakfast sandwich that was barely luke warm with a cold piece of unmelted cheese on it.  I am beyond the point of desperation for a decent coffee house.  I am so utterly desperate to have a solid coffee establishment close to home\n\nBuena Vista's coffee only saving grace was the cappuccino.  It didn't taste like dirty coffee shop floor lol but the foam was thick and velvety and the coffee was so so."
0,Did I come on a bad day or something because I definitely did not get the same experience as some of you yelpers. \n\nMy parents really wanted to have dinner here because apparently it's sooo good. I personally would have been happy with TGIF's happy hour but whatevs. Got seated pretty fast so no complaints there. Ordered their Boston clam chowder and shrimp scampi. First off what's so great about the clam chowder?!? I've had better in a soup can! I'd rather have soup from Panera or even Progresso lol. The shrimp scampi was also another let down. It's not bland but its not good either. Sucky part is that I have leftovers..ick.
0,"I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for the first time in September this year. During my stay, I took in a show, shopped, dined, used their beauty salon and gambled all at this hotel. These were pleasant experiences. \n\nWith that said, I will never return to this hotel ever again. I would rather stay with Brace from \""Gigolos\"" than spend another penny at this hotel. The reason for this is because their finances and customer service are the worst I have ever experienced. \n\nIf you look at my other reviews you will see I am normally a reasonable person. I try to take things in stride but I think this hotel's customer \""service\"" has broken me. I only write this review to warn people: \n1 - Have $300 on your credit card available\n2 - Don't split or make any changes to the card, they can and will screw it up with no apologies\n3 - Upon check out, even if the lines are super long, wait and check out in person so you can have a physical copy and assurance you have been credited. \n\nI know I made some mistakes here but my overall frustration was with how terrible they handle their finances and the customer service is abysmal. All of my trust is lost with this place. I would have gladly referred my friends to this place if they hadn't been so awful after check-out.\n\n**Edited because this was long and whiney.\n***Double edit because Cosmopolitan FINALLY came through (not because of this review)"
1,"Wow... my wife and I were craving pasta while we were in town... I find that food in Kitchener typically quite horrible.  \n\nWe sat at a table with a bunch of photos on the wall... old Italian family photos.  I thought... wow... nice photos they cut out of Vanity Fair.\n\nA nice older Italian woman that was smitten with my daughter was very prompt and courteous... the portions were perfect!  Not the massive American style portions.\n\nThe vodka sauce was as good as Il Mulino's in NYC... and my wife's pasta screamed Rome to us.  It was quite an incredible lunch experience.  Everything tasted homemade... at the end of the meal we took home a container of bolognese.  Good thing it wasn't in an air-tight container, otherwise I would've bought a ton more to bring home to California...\n\nAnyhow, back to the woman serving us and the photos... turns out, she owned the joint and her photo was one that I was admiring earlier on!  Love it!"
1,"We just moved to the neighborhood and we were looking for that new local spot, we were nervous after reading the reviews about slow or bad service.  My wife and I have been several times just for drinks as well as we have brought the whole family for lunch and dinner.  We have not had a bad experience yet!  My guess is some of these reviews may have been when they first opened and were not quite the fine oiled machine of today.  Good food and drink menu with reasonable pricing and specials.  Check this place out!"
0,"I have been coming to this office for the past 12 years.  Although I do like my Cardiologist (Dr. Hines), I cannot remember a time when I have had to call to make an appointment that I didn't have a problem with the scheduling department. This office is very unfriendly.  The staff act as though they are doing you a favor and that you are putting them out.  \n\nI had to call to make my yearly stress test (for which I had to wait over 6 minutes on hold before I got to speak with a person), she asked for my phone number \""in case we get disconnected\"", she spent the next 4 minutes trying to find an available appointment time and then proceeded to question as to whether I was \""authorized\"" to have this particular test.  After I explained that my doctor had ordered it, she said \""just a minute\"" and put me on hold.  After being on hold for over another 6 minutes, when it seemed she was coming back on the line, I was actually disconnected.  I waited a few minutes to see if she would call me back.  Then I called again, only this time instead of being told to wait the message went to a recording that said they were busy and if I would leave a message with my phone number, someone would get back to me immediately, that was 6 weeks ago and I never received a call back.  \n\nIf you have the time to waste and can deal with the disorganization and lack of good customer service, this is the place for you.  I will emphasize here that I find my doctor very good and have hung in there because I like him.  However, there may come a time when I just can't deal with the front office staff any longer.  They are so busy there, that they seem to not care as to whether they are inconsiderate to a patient because they don't have to work hard to find a replacement."
0,"I made a reservation at the Kona at City North on a Sun. night for a party of 8 to celebrate 3 birthdays and an anniversary.  When I booked the reservation, we all decided that Sun. would be great because they offer happy hour all day so we could enjoy the HH menu for our appetizers before dinner.  I confirmed with the girl who took our reservation that we would be doing HH & having dinner.  She asked where we would like to sit & I told her the dining room since there was 8 of us, 2 of which were kids.  AT THAT POINT, THE PERSON TAKING MY RESERVATION SHOULD HAVE TOLD US THAT WE CANNOT ENJOY THE  HH MENU IN THE DINING AREA....THAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE SEATED IN THE BAR IF WE WANTED ANYTHING FROM THE HH MENU!!!\n\nWell....that was not the case.  Once we arrived & were seated in the dining room, when I asked to see the HH menu to order our apps, the waiter informed us that we weren't allowed to enjoy any HH menu items in the dining room.  If we wanted to we could be moved into the bar area which was literally 15 feet away from where we were already seated.  Our waiter, Colin, was very nice & apologetic about the issue.  Eventually, the manager on duty came over & said there was \""nothing else he can do about this issue\"".....meaning we would have to get up & move our entire party with the 2 kids into the bar area that was only 15 feet away from the table we were currently at.\n\nWe ended up staying at our table in the dining room but told the manager how ridiculous that HH menu rule is, especially when we were literally the ONLY people sitting in the empty dining room the ENTIRE 2 hours we were there.  Our food was ok at best.....took forever to get one of the flatbread pizzas for my boys.  At least our waiter was very nice & apologized again for the HH menu debacle.  We told him it was not his fault & that the manager (Trevor) should have made an exception this one time due to the miscommunication of how our reservation was booked.\n\nMoral of this review.....if a restaurant manager is not willing to do the right thing for that situation, get up & leave!!!!!"
1,"Chipped beef on toast, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy and eggs maximillion all excellent!"
1,Great service and an awesome business. Used bikes without the head ache. 30 day warranty plus a trade in program. I bought two bikes from bicycle exchange and couldn't be happier.\n\nwho trys to buy a bike for $50 bucks and expects quality and a warranty?
1,"Went to this place as a last meal before my last visit to Montreal, surely was not disappointed! \n\nMy best friend, a vegetarian, was in for a pleasant surprise when the waitress told her any of the patties could be subbed with a vegetarian option! (Aubergine please!) \n\nThe burgers were supreme! (Although a touch pricey...) The brioche they were served on, amazing! The fries actually tasted like real French fries, not McDonalds! (an Achilles heel of many great burger places) \n\nCocktails were nice as well, a good cold sex on the beach in the middle of Montreal winter is not too bad! \n\nMy favorite part definitely had to be the ambiance! VERY tastefully designed from the white walls to the pop art paintings of celebrities and the high-top wooden tables! \n\nWe spoke to the owner, a man who is CLEARLY passionate about his burgers! \n\nWill definitely be back on my next trip."
0,"I loved, loved, loved the fair when I was a child. I LOVED IT. I got to see the Beach Boys in my first ever concert...such good times. I was so happy when we went. I would go at least 3-4 times while it was in town. Well, I definitely DO NOT love what the fair has become. Its a travesty, a sham, and...well...a mockery. Guys: its a Travishamockery. Let me explain why...now:\n\n~What To Do~\nWell, you will blow boatloads of cash..that's numero uno. Besides that, you can check out all the rides they offer, as well as exhibitions ranging from animals to crafts and baking, as well as the Expo area, where retailers hawk their products. Oh and the food, its the one time of the year where most people wont judge you for eating your soul away.\n\n~The Good~\nEh... there are some \""bright spots\"". The food is fun and different. I love the Indian Fry Bread stations, although every single vendor is not the same....you have to be picky. The food options are abundant as well, and if you do not care about what you put in you, its a field day for you. The Expo they hold each year has some fun vendors each year. In 2013, they weren't as much fun as previous years, but still they held my attention for a bit. I did try some of the extreme rides....holy hell, scary, but fun. I will admit I did enjoy hanging out with my fiance in cool weather, it was refreshing and relaxing to stroll around and have some fun. Also, the concerts and events they offer each year are pretty good for free admission, I simply haven't had the time or I would've hit up a number of them over the years.\n\n~The Bad~\nOy Vey...So, lets say about 7+ years ago (approximately) the whole re-invention of fairs began nationwide. With that change came increased prices, lower quality prizes, insanely fatty and poor quality foods, and whats worse: a really crummy corporate feel, by way of RCS out here in Phoenix. So now, we are left with what RCS has provided us. Its really a shell of former fun times. We still have the awesome destruction derby and concerts, as well as some fun rides still.. But they have stripped  all that away with the watered down prizes and games that are pretty much rigged....And the prizes... I mean, come on. They deduce down to dog chew toys really. Perfect size for our Yorkie and Chihuahua. Rips in about 3 days time. \n\nPrices are outrageous and I am consistently keeping an eye on spending...you are a fool to go to the fair and just spend whatever...because you will spend 100+ EASY with that mindset. I see a number of people defending the current incarnation, and it amuses me. I remember the balloon darts, when I could win a huge framed picture to hang up on my wall (I remember choosing a Michael Jordan picture)...Well, now, we have balloons, with hackisack-style balls filled with pellets. The balloon dart signs, with pictures of darts are still out there!!!!! \n\nRuining my childhood memories, that's what RCS is doing. And diets too, they just ruin so much...Up-charge me at the gate, and get rid of RCS. I do not care about spending more to get in, FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT. Getting in for free is not worth it. Just wretched. I could go on and on.. deplorable. \n\n~The Down low~\nI really am not sure where to go from here. Really am not. It's a rubbish product, really. Its like paying for a Jaguar, and getting an Aveo... its not right. I am giving 2 stars, because it actually could get worse, and if it does, I have an option to downgrade. I mentioned the redeeming factors already, which all make up the 2 stars they receive...but they do not help. Not a bit. I'll spare writing further, and let the review speak for itself. Save the money and go up North and hike and get your palms read by a hippy....or go golfing... or go to Castles and Coasters and mess around with your family....or go to Scottsdale and steal someone's Audi....or do a meth lab bust in AJ. All of these are equally invigorating and less expensive options, than spending $10 to throw a ball in a basket, attempting to win a cheap stuffed 1000'' stuffed bear."
1,"We were there today for lunch and WOW!  The food and service was terrific.  I ordered our usual:  Crispy chicken burger with swiss.  My husband ordered the Guac Burger.  We spotted a new item:  pretzel bites with dipping sauce.  WOW, yummy!  The server, Jerri was AWESOME.  She was friendly and super attentive.  Finally someone in the service industry happy to serve.  \n\nThey had some issues with our GCs, we told the server just take the complete $35 in GCs and not to worry about it.  The Manager gave us the 2 bonus $5 GCs back and said it was our lucky day.  We would have gotten like $1.50 back or something.  That was very kind of them.  =)"
0,"Super dirty casino that seems more than a flea market than a hotel. Have to walk through it to get to the buffet.  Buffet kind of like an Old Country Buffet experience.  The food was ok, mac and cheese great.  As expected lots of families with kids, so it was kind of noisy and chaotic.  After visiting some of the other venues on the strip, Circus Circus seemed a bit outdated.  If you are looking for food  and don't really care about the atmosphere, or quality go for it.  We were pretty desperate, and the variety filled us up. I must say, the cleanliness of the place exceeded my expectations."
0,"Good wine selection but the dude named Paul asked me if I need wine glasses or am I going to drink it out of the bottle.  Hu!  I have wine glasses thank you.  Rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless it's a bad joke, probably but still inappropriate."
0,"I've been here about 4 times. \nI think 3 out of 4 of those visits were negative. \n\nThe rapidity of the service is totally non-consistent. Sometimes the food takes too long and other times the waiter/tress never stops by. At one visit, for myself and my neighbor our sausages were extremely cold. It was embarrassing for everyone, and all they did was take our plates as they were and changed the sausages to fresh ones. \n\nThe smoothies are totally w-e-a-k. It's not real fruit they use in there. It's thick frozen mud. Not authentic at all.\n\nTHE MENU IS MESSED UP ALSO. For breakfast, on the eggs page it says at the top: Includes toast, potatoes - showing it at the top that all of them come with those extras, then you get your plate with nothing?! So you ask and they say \""Oh the menu is like that, but with this plate those are not included.\""\n\nLike, what the HECK is that?!"
0,"I am a pho fanatic, and this place failed the basic test for me. The broth was tasteless and so hot that the noodles got overcooked by the time it was cool enough to put in my mouth. The decor is pleasant if a little beat up. Everything was medium clean. The waiters were not especially helpful, but everything was quick."
1,"Good luck on trying to find this little gem! It's definitely not an easy find, but if you're one of the lucky ones who do find it, you know just how delicious it is!\n\nI'm not a huge ramen eater, so when my friends suggested we try this little place, let's just say that I wasn't super thrilled. But I like hanging out with friends and will try just about anything, so figured why not. And boy am I glad I did.\n\nWhile the ramen bowls start at $8 and you have to pay additionally for each topping, it doesn't make it the cheapest meal. (My thoughts on this is more or less for college kids, since it's on Mill...). However, with that said, my $11 meal here, was totally worth it and suuuuuper delicious! So much so, that I'd even enjoy going back!"

1,"This is the place you go to when you want to feel super cool.\n\nThere is so much history to this building (and apparently is haunted...boo!) which makes you feel like you are experiencing a true taste of Madison culture.  It started out as a Vaudeville theater, which you just can't find anywhere else!  \n\nThe old fashioned box seating juxtaposes the trendy hipster regulars in a way that feels so good.\n\nCheck their site frequently for unique film showings, awesome bands and tons of costume theme nights.  \n\nGreat bar and pretty good drinkin' deals.  Themed, of course."
0,"First time sitting at a table here instead of the sushi bar. Service was awful! The waitress had to have walked by my empty glass (that was conveniently sitting on the edge of the table) at least 10 times, I had to wave her down to get a refill; I don't know if she would have ever asked if I wanted more. Also, I asked for a non-spicy version of one of their chef's special rolls and the waitress suggested I try another roll, I agreed and instead of getting just the suggestrd roll she also ordered me the original roll(spicy). I ordered edamame, that never came... we asked for the check and the waitress asked if we would like dessert or a sliced orange, asked for the Orange, the check came... the orange was missing...Very disappointed as they are one of the few places with fresh sushi in town."
0,"Same as another poster I wish I could give them a 0. Truly the worst airline I have ever dealt with and I fly quite a bit. I have no problem with all the fees they make it very clear what their policy is from the beginning. But that is about the only thing good in my opinion.\n I was coming home from Ft Lauderdale and there were three flight leaving around the same time,  they only had 7 agents working We were in line for over an hour just to give them our bags, we already had our boarding passes. My son was meeting me in Ft Lauderdale flying out of Mesa, Az at 12:55am and after waiting an hour and a half then sitting on the plane they pulled him and 8 other people off because of weather they said they could not get to Ft Lauderdale. They gave the people nothing except a refund or a flight the next night at 12:55am so  my son had to sit in the airport for over 30 hours to wait for the next flight. Then I found out the flight did go all the way to Ft Lauderdale when I went to the counter. So I believe they lied to my son and the 8 other people. We had plans to go to Orlando when he got in, I ended up having to cancel and losing my money, then spending more money on getting a hotel in Ft Lauderdale\nI also noticed they are horrible about over booking the flights. I was on 4 different flights on this trip and there were always many people with other people already in their seats and we heard many comments from other passengers that this happens all the time. We also heard from a lot of people about them just canceling flights for no real reason and real soon to take off time.\nThe two planes that I was on had many broken seats and some had no tray tables. at one point the person on front of me put their seat back and was practically laying in my lap. The flight attendant just laughed and said \""yeah it must be broken\"".  The shoddy maintenance inside the cabin really makes me worry about the parts we can't see. \nThere are more things but I do not have time to write them all. I highly recommend NOT!!!!!!! using this airline. It really is not worth the cheaper price and really if you bring bags or want water it really is not that much cheaper."
1,"We came here at the wrong time. Right when lunch was about to end and dinner was starting. :( There was even a VIP line where they charge $12 pp for a shorter line (approx 15min) instead of 1 hr. We didn't want to chance it since we only had 10 min b4 dinner started and we decided to wait.\n\nRockefeller oysters were delicious but wasn't ready when I asked about it. Minus 1/2 star\nAlaskan Crab was cut and fresh\nOmelets (made to order is always a plus in my book but this should be standard)\nSmoked salmon (delicious and fresh)\nPotstickers and dumplings (ordinary but can't knock it)\nCorn flake fried chicken (not a fan as it was pretty greasy)\nRack of lamb (server was a nazi as I asked for 2 slices)\nPrime Rib (I only asked for a medium rare slice and she gave me a mean look like she didn't care) Ugh, hello? You are there to serve my food!! Minus 1 star!!!\n\nDessert: (everything was good and I wish I could have ordered more.\nCreme Brulee (very yummy)\nGelato (4-5 different flavors and I ordered the white espresso) \nChocolate rice krispy treats w/ white choc and dark choc\n\nServers were great and promptly removed our dirty plates and refilled our drinks.\n\nI'd come back but probably take advantage of lunch/dinner by coming here early. Not the best buffet in Vegas in my book but good enough. (Bellagio is still the best for me) I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars."
0,"Same feeling as Matt E. Tried it again in hopes for a better experience. Sunday morning , NO muffins! Really? Asked for iced hot choc for my son, got hot. Asked for burrito for here, got it to go. Food was 25 minutes! Coffee was in a to go cup, wanted to dine here. All tables were dirty, I had to clean my own table. Service was average- but everytime there's an excuse \""were short handed\"". I'm not coming back! The manager/ owner needs to figure it out. It's the technology age: take all these yelp reviews and fix the issues to re-gain business."
0,"This is the first time ever since I started wearing glasses that I've had issues getting adjusted to my Rx. My first Rx my right eye was still blurry so they told me to wait a week. So I did and it was still blurry. So they did another eye exam and they told me that I have astigmatism on my right eye okay so I waited again for my new Rx. When I got my new Rx it was weird at first everything was curved. They told me that wait another week for me to get adjusted to the new Rx. Yeah, I couldn't wait another week I had to call in after 4 days of wearing the new Rx cause I kept on having headaches and having to take off the glasses to rest my eyes. I should've listened to my friend who went here she told me that they messed up her Rx as well. But I'll see I have another appointment to try and get this resolved if it's not resolved on the third try I'm going to want my money back and I'm going to Len's Crafters."
0,"The relationship started out good at first. The person on the phone was very nice and scheduled me for same day service. Since it was a rental, they had to contact my renter to schedule a time. All was good. The Technician called me around 4 pm to tell me that the compressor was bad and it needs to be changed out, $2098.00 for 6 month warranty, of course he suggested a better 1 year plan for $2600.00. I  realized from reading the past reviews that this company tend to charge more. I asked the technician several times\"" IF THE ISSUE COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE?\"" He replied every time \""No Mam\"" this is the only way to fix the air conditioning and make it run again properly. Also, the compressor has to be order so he was not sure when it will get done. The company will have to call me back later to reschedule since they need to order the part and do not know when it will be available. \n So I called Legacy Air for a quote, they gave me a quote over the phone of $1850. 00 to change the compressor if that was the problem.\nSo I followed my guts and reviews on Yelp and went with Legacy Air. \nYES, I had to pay #1 plumbing the $49.00 service fee. (total waste of money) but It was worth it to follow my gut.\n\nLegacy Air had an appointment open up at 6pm. The Legacy Air technician called at 6:15pm and said there was something wrong with wiring out side and fixed it. He charged me $70.00 total. Now the air conditioner is blowing cool air and running good. \nTHANKS TO LEGACY AIR, I DIDN'T GET RIPPED OFF TODAY!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"For a drive through coffee, very very slow. You would be quicker running into Starbucks. As for the coffee, if they get your order correct the quality of the drinks will very. The iced mocha has un-dissolved chocolate powder in it and the other drinks can range from weak to too \nsweet. Try once, but consider other options for quick good drive through coffee. Sorry Talebu"
0,Bagels here are now $3.49 for a bagel with cream cheese. Uh sorry but it isn't that good! These bagels are pretty good but I'm not going to pay that much just for a bagel. I would rather stay home to eat one I bought from the store. One bagel is $1.19. How is adding cream cheese an extra $2.39? Wowza
1,"Went here in July with colleagues; was surprised it was not listed on Yelp!  So, this is my first time to add a new restaurant for others to discover.  The food was excellent.  And the star of the experience was the unique approach of dual wine pairings - one which is an expected match (the accord) and an unexpected match (the discord).  Everyone enjoyed their food, the staff was quite cordial and the wine was, indeed, a nice fit to the culinary experience.    Check this place out and be one of the first Yelpers to see what you've been missing."
1,"My husband got back today from New Jersey (what a relief he isn't stuck in Hurricane Irene's path anymore!) and since we were in the neighborhood we figured we'd go to Over Easy.  Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)\n\nWe stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!\n\nMy kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.\n\nMy husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.\n\nI ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.\n\nWe came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.  We will definitely be coming back."
1,"Great Place! The food was like a fine restaurant in Taos! I had the Taos Combo Honey Smoked Pork Tamale, Tenderloin Relleno & Shrimp Enchilada for 16.95. Awesome! Rustic and tasty! They server was very good! We went to the Roaring Fork the night before and the food was not that good and cost 2 times more than B/A and I was treated to an undercooked piece of chicken! :oP Go if you have the chance! Don't forget the Sopapillas! We had 10 people and the service was great.\n As for the one star ratings. You can't drop a single star rating an then say the food is great. To me 90% of a rating is the food. Scottsdale location was Awesome as well! went there 2 nights in a row. Places have off nights it happens. If you say the food was great but you will never go again seems like your a bit high maintenance. Get over it!"
0,"This particular Cracker Barrel in Mesa is where I have had the worst dining experience of my life. My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends. We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant. I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone? Our table was moved because oops! No one's working that section of the restaurant. \n\nIt took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said \""Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on.\"" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already. \n\nBy the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our \""actual\"" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job. \n\nToo long, didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken, you should consider leaving before you even start. I recommend Logan's Roadhouse."
0,If you want a real workout than don't go to this gym.. The staff have some sort of mental issues.. They're really down and they don't like to be friendly in any shape or form. I want to ask them what their problem is... But instead I joined another gym.  Their STAFF SUCKS!!!!
0,"I'm a pretty easy going guy and appreciate a local barbershop.   I hate chains and like to patronize the local guy who busts his hump opening up a new business.  Clearly this is a \""2\"" location and the \""first\"" Boss Barber shop must have be successful in order to open up another location.  I am always on the lookout for a new barber that is closer to home.  I was excited when this opened up and was next to my gym and much closer to home then my other great barber.\n\nYou have to think each month me and my two boys will get our hair cut, so I would think that's some good business. I think I tip pretty well - $5 on a haircut.  You would also think that I know at least a few guys who need haircuts and shaves locally, and my fellow gym rats would hear about my new great Barber experience.\n\nSo when I walk into your place, midweek after a workout, why wouldn't you ask me if I needed help?  \nWhy would I just stand there for 2-3 minutes?   \n\nTwo guys were working there.  \n\nOne was cutting someone and the other guy was clearly on his cell phone on a personal call.  Unless that call was 1) Your parole officer, 2) Your mother in the hospital, or 3) Publisher's Clearing House telling you, you just won a bunch of FU money - I think you could notice me and say, \""Hey man, can I help you? Or \""Hey I'll be with you in one second\"" and wrap up your phone call.   If it was an important call - couldn't the guy cutting hair pause for a second and walk over to greet me with the same type of response?\n\nI dunno.  I was interested in a cut and a shave.  \n\nMaybe some of you fellow Yelpers think I'm being a hard a$$ or maybe I'm just \""old school\"" and think a personal cell call takes second place to a new customer, walking into a new business, but I don't think so.   \nI'm in sales.  Customers matter.  New customers are tough to acquire. Put your cell phone down and deal with it another time.\n\nOh well...I guess I'll never know if you were good or worthy of my business."
1,Best creamy chicken pesto pasta I have had in a while.  Steak and pesto is also an option.  Great atmosphere and lighting.  Fast service and bread is to die for.  A nice Italian eatery in a Safeway shopping center.
1,"I've never stayed in the rooms at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, but I hope to one of these days as this is one of my favorite casinos to visit while in Las Vegas.  What I love is the many things to see and do here as well as awesome restaurants and fun shopping.  I also like the easy access Mandalay Place Mall that takes you to the Luxor.  Mandalay Bay is also the home to Michael Jackson One, the Cirque show that I have not yet seen, but that everyone who I have talked to about it absolutely raves about how wonderful it is.\n\nSome of my favorite things are the Minus 5 Ice Bar and then the mall near that.  I like that the House of Blues has made it's home here and I LOVE RM Seafood and Fleur, some really delicious restaurants with great service.\n\nOn my recent trip, I also hit up the Shark Reef Aquarium, which was small, but nicely done.\n\nMandalay Bay has a HUGE convention/events center and the one place I haven't been, but dream of hanging out at:  THE POOL!  It looks so fun and I plan to spend some time there one of these days!\n\nAll of the staff there that I have interacted with have been super friendly AND I've actually won money here gambling before.  I've just never had a negative experience at the Mandalay Bay, so hopefully, I'll one day also stay here and experience the hospitality and rooms!"

(Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! \nExtras on tables to get your Pho on.. \nOrdered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy!

1,"Considering it's not unheard of that my boyfriend and I discuss restaurant options and ideas for a given evening, resulting in us almost always ending up at Pita Jungle, it's a bite of fresh air to have discovered Herb 'N Flavors. Great place!  We ordered the artichoke & spinach dip w/veggies to start, which was good, not great. Loved their cucumber water though!  We shared the spicy chicken wrap (awesome!), veggie rice bowl (great flavors), and a side of beets with candied walnuts.  Fresh, flavorful and good quality. Menu contains local and organic ingredients.  Down-to-earth vibe of the place and cozy feel, despite bring in a bit of a creepy plaza. We'll definitely be back!"
0,"if someone flag this review i will be very pissed off.\ni'm not kidding, i didn't watch any horror movie, we weren't drunk, and i'm not that imaginative either. but i'm asian, and yes supernatural exists, go to bali if you don't trust me, and what happened here is still somewhat nothing compared to bali.\n\ni got the spa suite a week ago, to be precise, it's room 12860\n\nit was our first night in vegas, so when we saw the room, we THOUGHT it was okay, but as soon as we moved to caesar's palace and hard rock, that room was like shit, but still better and cheaper that mgm though\n\nhere's the problem, believe it or not, this hotel (especially this room) is haunted. laugh if you want, i don't care. i'm writing this review for those of you who are \""sensitive\"" so that you won't be attacked in here\n\nthe suite consists of the living room and the bedroom with jacuzzi, i slept in the living room and nothing happened to me (or probably because i slept so deep) but they who sleep in the bedroom were attacked the whole night\n\nmy sister slept next to the jacuzzi and it was dry, we cleaned it out, there were no sound for like hours but around 3am, the water started to pour again and stop and pour again and stop, just like someone is teasing her, then her blanket were pulled down gradually (it just doesn't makes sense at all for a blanket to go down with an interval) she grabbed back the blanket and she felt by herself that someone is pulling down the blanket, as soon as she grabbed the blanket, something grabbed her leg and pulled her down. she struggled and kicked but there were nothing to kick and suddenly every kind of terror disappeared. that's what happened to the bed next to jacuzzi\n\nfor the next bed that's located far from jacuzzi, there were these twin sisters of my girlfriend's who throughout the night heard the sound of cellphone interference through a speaker. the problem is, we didn't put our cellphone next to the bed, and afaik, there were no speakers at all near them. the final blow here is that one of the twins were physically twisted to the other way around by a certain of force, it's like being rolled forcibly\n\nlaugh if you want. but hey, different people experience different life. i wasnt born sensitive about this issue but they were born sensitive. so you might not be born sensitive but im sure my review will benefit someone else who's \""sensitive\""\n\n2 stars for cheap rate and decent room (at least for me)"
0,"FOOD:  2-2.5 Stars\nSERVICE:  1 Star is Too Many\n\nHad 3 pies I needed for Thanksgiving.  Emailed and exchanged emails to pay for delivery of pies for $8.  No problem.  Even checked in a few days before to confirm delivery.  Response was no problem.\n\nSo day before thanksgiving, no pies arrived.  All day long.  I had wanted them before noon, per email, as I was leaving work early.   Called pick up location... supposedly many upset customers, no one had cell phone for Slade Grove.\n\nAt 5:30, the office shut down, two messages left, four emails, I had to leave and show up to a dinner party with no dessert.  \n\nNOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM OWNER ON ANY EMAIL, and they weren't even nasty at all.  I mean, anyone I know would have been nasty, but I don't believe in that.  Honestly, I was sure he must have been in an accident or some other emergency, and I would hear from him, no response.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around.  I write to him again, a week and a half early, ask for 3 pies.  Exchange emails with confirmations, no problems.  No mention from him again on earlier problem.\n\nThis time, I'm picking them up from pick-up place, a postal store.  When I got to pick up, only 2 of 3 pies are there.  No explanation.  Owner of store says \""I'm lucky to get any, as many people didn't get any pies they ordered.\""\n\nSo I take the pies home and eat them.  They were OKAY.  Not great, not even good.  Just okay.  I wouldn't pay $10 for one of them, let alone their $33 retail price tag.\n\nThey look like some brand new culinary student made them.  Maybe he brought it help for the Christmas order.  Whatever.  And they taste pretty decent, but not good.\n\nI can't tell you how disappointing the whole experience has been.\n\nSorry, all caps:  THIS GUY SHOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS.  Some people just aren't made to run a business.  They don't have a lick of common sense, or business customer service, etc.  \n\nI'm sure the guy can bake.  I'm sure his food is delicious.  But he needs to work for someone else, who can operate a small business.\n\nIf you are thinking of relying on this guy to deliver food for an event, my advice is think again.  He burned me and many others... TWICE.\n\nI'm not even going to try and get my 3rd pie I pre-bought.\n\nNot worth the mental aggravation.\n\nSTAY AWAY.  You've been warned."

0,"I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake."
0,"I love to hate this place.  The location can't be beat, it's more of a hassle for me to drive here because of one way streets than it is to walk the couple of blocks from my apartment.  It has everything a regular big box chain grocery store should have, and then some.  The bread slicer is quite convenient (pro tip: stick a baguette in the bread slicer for super easy buschetta for a crowd).  The selection of fresh fish is great.  I find the produce pricey, but of good quality and variety.\n\nThe not so good part is that I have to agree with Mike S., the staff is generally quite rude.  I try to avoid going through a regular cash if at all possible, and will choose to wait for a self service cash, because I have had so many bag experiences with cashiers and baggers.  Everytime I think it's me, I just have to go to PA on Parc or another big chain grocery, to realize that I only have problems here.  With the price of groceries always on the rise, I want to actually be able to enjoy the food I buy.  That means no manhandling my bread, or throwing produce.   It also means not putting my groceries into a million flimsy plastic bags when I have an armfull of sturdy reusable bags that I'm trying to hand over.  Whenever I try to politely to ask the staff to please be a little more careful, or to use my reusable bags, I'm met with standoffish gruff staff.  I once had a cashier yell at me for accusing the packer of squishing my bread.  I didn't accuse him of squishing my bread, I just asked that they not ram the rest of the groceries into it.\n\nThe other not so good aspect of things is that the store can get really packed.  Monday through Wednesday evenings student discounts are offered, which means there are a lot more packs of roomates going shopping together.  It's also pretty packed on Sunday afternoon due to the proximity to tamtams.  And forget popping in on your way home from work to pick up something for dinner if you work a standard 9 to 5, you'll be there for quite awhile.  \n\nSo I get around all of the above by going early on the weekends, when the store is empty and I have my choice of self serve machines."
0,"I have been here a handfull of times now an have yet to be impressed.  If you sit at a table expect the service to be beyond slow.  It has gotten better since they first opened but it is still not good.  On top of being slow I don't think I have met one friendly person that works here.  Most are not rude but just not friendly.  I recommend if you want a drink to go directly to the bar where the service is a little quicker.  They do have a small out door space which is nice to sit if you have a small group (no more than 4 people).  They do have a large beer selection so you are bound to find something you like.  However be prepared to pay, they are not cheap.  I am sure this is due to the fact that they do not serve food (you can order delivery from several local restaurants directly to the bar) so they are making all of there money on beer alone.  It is a really nice space and is well spread out so it never seems packed.  There are plenty of tvs if you are looking to watch the game.  All in all a good place to stop for one beer but not a place I would want to hang at for the evening."
1,"Been going to this place for years....... Hadn't been there in a long time and happened to be on Decatur today and we stopped by........ We should have just gotten one hoagie...... We split one and that was more than enough for both of us, ended up saving the other one for later..... Not a fan of fried Okra but we had some anyway, it was so so, I prefer the zucchini .. Don't understand the complaints about the prices, i think for what you get its fine.....We didn't bother eating outside since it's too damn hot this time of year, so we just brought everything home and it was pretty darn good.... We'll be back for more next time we're on that side of town........"
0,"Located inside the Mirage, Carnegie Delicatessen is a \""New York\"" style deli serving casual food. I came here twice during my stay in Vegas, once for Breakfast and another time for lunch and both times, I did leave full, but disappointed. \n\nIt has the Carnegie Delicatessen has the \""NY\"" feel to it and located almost in the middle of the casino. Open 24hours they offer a good selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Prices here at Carnegie Delicatessen are on the high side. Basic breakfast items such as omelets, pancakes, and such, starting around $8 and goes as high as $20. Sides here will run you around $4 - $5. For lunch they offer a good selection of hot and cold sandwiches and things like chicken livers, hash, meatloaf, etc starting around $12 - $24. Pretty spendy for the type of food you get that usually runs about at half the price. \n\nFor breakfast, just needed something to fill the stomach and got a basic bagel and cream cheese. The bagel, well for a \""NY\"" deli, tasted something I could get at Costco. Honestly, nothing special. Everyone else got eggs and one guy got a burger and fries at 6AM and they ate it because after a night of drinking, what else are you going to do. The waitress at this time was a bit bitchy, but not sure if it was us or she was just in a foul mood. Also the service was slow and she forgot my friend's fries. \n\nWhen I came here for lunch with my brother, service here was nonexistent. They had plenty of servers, at one point I think I counted about 4 or 5 of them gathered just chatting away in a corner while several of us were waiting to get served and several tables had dirty dishes on them. \n\nBrother was suffering from a hangover and decided to get the mozaball soup and I got the hot dog and some fries. When we got our food, I have to give them credit for their portion size. My brother got a big bowl of soup and I got literally a foot long hot dog and a plate of fries piled up high. My brother didn't like his soup at all and this even suffering from a massive hangover when anything tastes good. My hot dog was decent though the homemade sauerkraut was excellent. It was probably a notch better than a hotdog you would be able to get at Costco as it was a bit spicy which I liked. The fries were ok. Nothing special to report about. \n\nThe waitress on the other hand, was more interested in talking to her fellow servers than say, bring us a bill. My brother and I waited about 15 minutes before we flagged down someone else to bring us our bill and that took an additional 10 minutes as 2 other tables in our same area requested the same thing. \n\nAs to rating, honestly the food is just average but its WAY overpriced. The service here is just plain lousy both times I came here. There are SO MANY other options here, that Carnegie Delicatessen is a waste of time and unless you're coming here at 3AM and no other place is open, I would highly advise people to skip out. They got good portions, but that's about it, 2 stars for Carnegie Delicatessen."
1,The Food was DELICIOUS. ... We had happy hour dishes because the were booked up for 2 hours....BUT it was Great ...I had very meatr short rib slider..the VERY cheesy and creamy mac and cheese. .. Asparagus fries coated in a light cornmeal coating with tarragon dipping sauce and a Very GOOD Moscow Mule... .and the prices were GREAT! ....And also we had a GREAT server named Camille
1,"Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  \nThe Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices."
1,"Sardine is just splendid.  My husband's mother and boyfriend came from across the pond and we decided to celebrate here tonight.  We shared a bottle of wine, had great conversation and slowly filled our bellies with some wonderful French food.  I ordered the salmon with lentils, saut\u00e9ed spinach, portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and beurre blanc.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband ordered the evening special of duck confit with cabbage and glazed carrots.  The glazed carrots with this dish will go down as one of the best things I've ever eaten... I felt bad but I stole most of them from him.  Dessert was gorgeous...I had a hazelnut ganache with caramel and it was sinfully delicious.  My mother in law ordered a plum cake with the best roasted almond ice cream.  Our server was fun and made our meal even better....I cannot wait to go back for brunch...and happy hour...and dinner."
0,Need a NEW menu that describes what you are serving people!  Butter salad was all field greens with a couple pieces of butter lettuce.  Quinoa and bulgar wheat side dish was mostly arugula with a little quinoa.  Salmon was served dry and overcooked.  I had to cut it with a knife!  Noisy.  Came home hungry!
0,"I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer.  On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared.  For example, the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy, with oil oozing off of batter - a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature.  When broccoli and beef over rice was offered, take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food.  For a dish over $5, there should be more than two pieces of beef.  Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold, with cheese not even partially melted.\n\nAs this is a student run enterprise, let's hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves!"

Pour des vrais croissants au beurre, faites un d\u00e9tour par Froment et S\u00e8ve \u00e0 Rosemont."
1,Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.\n\nI was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.
0,"Disappointment is an understatement. The sushi was not good definitely have had better and fresher. Super white tuna was tiny! And flavorless. The Japanese lasagna roll was cold! The cream cheese on top was warm but the combination of cold roll and hot topping was odd, and by odd I mean bad, and by bad I mean worst. The service was pretty shitty, shoulda sat at the bar. I was getting really angry after having been seated for 15 minutes and had not received my water or even wasabi or ginger. Now that I think about it I NEVER got the wasabi or ginger throughout my whole meal. The server was nice when she came around. She did get tied up cashing out a large party so we can't blame her for that. But seriously she was gone for like 20 minutes. The poor guy next to me got up from the table and took his empty cups up to her so she could refill them. The sushi chefs seemed nice but I absolutely will not be back there."

1,"I went to Zack's Hamburgers for the first time, surprisingly since I am a Charlotte native, for lunch today. I got the Zack's Special which is a double cheeseburger with all the fixin's and their special sauce with a side of fries and a sweet tea. Before taking a bite I had to indulge in the crushed ice that we all dream about in the tea. Man that stuff is good.\n\nThe burger was delicious but not because it was anything fancy. It was more a burger that reminded me of my childhood. It was one of those things that just puts a smile on your face with every bite until the very last. The fries were perfectly salted and simple. No ketchup needed. I did see some chili cheese fries that I may have to try out next time. \n\nService was great and she recommended the Zack's. I had to get a refill of tea and some more crushed ice and they were attentive to me even with a long line. \n\nOverall, great experience. Just remember to get there about 11:30 or after 1 for lunch to prevent waiting in a long line."
0,"Worst location in entire country. A Dbl Whopper Meal & 3-pc Chicken Strips, $17.50\n\n2 people in line and it takes 12 minutes to get an order?\n\nChicken Strips had been re-heated at least 3 times. Asked for sauce to smother the leather, was told Id have to pay extra. Threw one on the floor and it sounded like a golf ball bouncing."
0,"Once upon a time, Ian Rankin, JK Rowling and Alexander McCall Smith used to go to The Elephant House to sit and write over endless cups of coffee. Lord knows what any of them would think if they went back for an espresso or latte now. \n\nAside from the terrible service and permanently stressed looking staff, the place is so darn busy it's difficult to get a table. Spring to summer especially, the cafe is jam-packed with tourists desperate to secure a seat with views of the Castle. To make it worse, there's merchandise everywhere you look, the music is insipid and there's a live webcam opening til closing time so strangers across the world can watch as you eat your lunch! \n\nThe biggest disappointment however, has to be the food and drink. On paper, soup, panninis, pitta, quiche and baked potatoes sounds quite promising but I suspect from tasting the last two that everything is part cooked in advance then microwaved. The coffee I ordered was equally bland and frothy. \n\nFree Wi-Fi or not, The Elephant House are going to have to raise their game if they want to inspire a new generation of writers!"
0,I decided to give this place another try. It was a mistake. They were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case. Service was average. My friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned.
0,"I've always enjoyed taking my family to Bill Johnson's, but on our recent visit (2/29/12) the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and their new prices have took a turn for the worse.\n\nThe bbq pork ribs were tough as leather, the fries were very greasy and portion controlled to the max, the mac and cheese seemed like they just poured liquid cheese on top of the boiled macaroni, and to make it worse, the prices on the menu have skyrocketed.  I feel that if their going to charge more for their menu items, the quality of the food and portion sizes need to be changed as well.  I was very disappointed with the amount of money we spent for the crappy food we ate.  \n\nFurthermore, I expressed my concerns with the waitress, but she didn't seem very interested at all.  With that said, I will NEVER return to Bill Johnson's because of the BIG let down.  This was once a great place to eat, but after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, this restaurant went downhill."
0,"I had been here twice but will not go again.  The Philly cheesesteak was fine, but the salad was below average.  The mix salad had an odd combination of some canned veggies and didn't live up to expectation.\n\nUltimately, I am not going back because of the service I received trying to get a free cup of water to go with my meal.  I went back and forth with both the guy at the counter and the manager as they kept trying to make me buy a bottle of water instead of drinking from the tap.  I even offered to pay a small fee just for a regular fountain cup and they still wouldn't budge.  They insisted I pay full price for the big cup, even though I was just getting water.  They mentioned that the water at the fountain was somehow \""bad\"" but the sodas were fine.  Don't they know that the fountain soda has the same water in it??  I finally got my way, but it was infuriating and enough to make me not want to go back."

0,"Took the family to this particular Red Lobster for my oldest son's birthday (he wanted Red Lobster).  We usually go to the S. Alma School location, but decided to try this one.  Big mistake!  We entered and the hostess was not very friendly, and was rolling her eyes about something when we greeted her.  We waited the 15-20 mins to be seated, no biggy.  We get seated and the waitress comes by for our drink order.  We get drinks and take a few to decide our order, and this is when the fun started.  The waitress never mentions specials, etc so as we order I ask for a particular item that she states is popular and that is why they're out of it.  I make a choice on something else, but this could have been avoided by a simple explanation of specials and a \""by the way, we are out of this\""  So we get our slads and biscuits and it seemed to be ok.  Now our order arrives, me and my sons get our orders, my wife gets a portion of what is supposed to be served as an entree in appetizer form.  The waitress explains here are these shrimps, the grilled take longer, it's my fault but it should be up in 2 minutes.  Ok, 10 minutes later, the grilled shrmp skewer is brought out, no sides that are supposed to be with them.  The waitress asks did you want me to bring those out?  Really?  With a little bit of an attitude I might add.  My wife then asks to speak to  a manager.  He comes over about 5-7 minutes later, which makes me think he may have over camplaints.  He was very nice and comped her meal and my son's dessert.  The 2 stars are for him making her order right,  It will be a long time, if ever we go back there due to some piss poor attitudes by people that should be working in a toll booth rather than dealing in the service industry."
0,This is a large group review. We celebrated a friends bridal shower here. We went early around 11 or 11:30 hoping to beat the weekend lunch craziness. Sevice was incredibly slow and it about 2 hours to get our food. Our waitress was very inattentive and I kept on having to get up to go find someone to help us with drinks. We have been here before with smaller groups and have had a great experience so I was disappointed with our larger group. 1 server for 15 people was just not sufficient.
0,I believe that the owner is Rick from my two phone calls with him I think it should be *rick. I asked what Sinatra box sets he had and reeled off the sets I was looking for and waited with baited breath all I got was a torrent off abuse and a hang up. As I was staying on the strip which I explained I did not want 2 needless taxi fares if the sets were not there or too expensive. Rick must struggle with the concept of customer service which in the USA I usually find to my liking he must be a lottery winner who does not need the money. If they could only relocate the shop to the Grand Canyon or under Lake Mead this would be a great help!!!!!!
1,This place rocks. They saw us on short notice and took care of business. Elvis was amazing. Was worth the trip!
1,"I don't know if I was particularly starving or exhausted or some sick combination of both, but I didn't go into Sage expecting a whole lot, but was blown away by the service and the food quality! \n\nIt was surprisingly empty for a Friday night, but as long as the food is good, what do I care?  I got the Chef's menu and enjoyed every single dish.  The chef started us off with a little amuse bouche of some sort of escargot.  I'm not a huge fan of snails, but this one tasted a bit smoky and not too much like snail, so all was well.  My first dish was the Wagyu Beef Tartare, with a poached egg yolk on top.  It was served with a generous amount of delicious toasted bread soaked in olive oil and the combination of the beef, egg, and bread was fantastic.  It was followed up with a couple of seared scallops and braised oxtail.  the scallops were cooked perfectly and the oxtail was so tender it practically fell apart.  My main dish was a 48 hour beef belly (actually, it's marinated for 24 hours, then cooked for 48 hours, so it should really be called a 72 hour beef belly) which was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  By that time, I was completely full; however, this beef belly was so good I finished it all and powered through.  I finished off my meal with an apple and fennel crumble-like concoction with some brown butter ice cream.  While it was delicious, it was way too sweet for me and I couldn't handle it after the copious amount of food I just ingested.\n\nRegardless, the service was amazing - all of the waiters were very attentive and friendly.  The food was delicious and completely blew me away!  I don't know why this restaurant wasn't more packed, because I've definitely been to other \""higher-rated\"" restaurants that underwhelmed and disappointed me.  I'd recommend Sage if you're looking for a great meal at a great price!"
0,"All I can say is that in my 5 visits to Smashburger, they have never ONCE got our order right (and theres only 2 or 3 of us!)\n\nThe food is EXTREMELY over priced. A burger, fries, and drink will run you $11. \n\nTheir fries are not good. And while their burgers are tasty, theyre just too small. \n\n5 times was one too many. Will not be giving my money to this business anymore."
1,Can't beat their selection on children's clothing. I was commenting to an employee about the great finds for children's clothes and toys and she mentioned that's most of their donations. When I'm in town I'll make it a point to go there again.
1,"Much better.. Sorry Von's.\n\nFamily run - owner is usually on property. Super friendly staff. Excellent prices. Amazing butcher. Great deli. Produce - gives any Mexican market a run for its money.\n\nSpeciality items, this is the place.\n\nGlazier's Food Marketplace is the best of Vegas. No question about it."
1,"DeFalcos was the king.\n\nSince I found Andreolis my life has changed.  Fresh baked bread, finest cuts of meats, and hand made pastas.  It does not get any better than this.  I had not tasted good balsamic vinegar and olive oil till I had some at Andreolis (granted a good bottle of olive oil will cost you upwards of $50).  \n\nI have been to Andreolis a few different times now and each time I go I have to try something new.  Usually when you go to a place there are one or two good things to eat on the menu.  Not so at Andreolis.  As my fellow foodie Pete likes to say \""it is a check list not a menu\"".  I have had sandwiches, salads, bread and meat trays, but the crown jewel is their raviolis.  As an example I ordered their mushroom ravs one day and they were out.  Michael (the owners son) comes out to my table and lets me know but tells me they have taken care of me.  When my plate arrives he lets me know that they made me some pumpkin ravs instead.  My heart drops in my shoes because I hate all things pumpkin.  But, I grin and bare it knowing that everything else I have tried here is top notch.  I take my first bite and a large smile comes over my face.  The ravs were so good I wanted to cry.  Every bite I could taste the hint of truffle oil, the butter that was mixed in, and slight tinge of sage.  The pumpkin filling was so good I wanted to go to my moms house and slap her for making such god awful pumpkin pies growing up and making me think pumpkin was an evil squash.\n\nAndreolis is not some fancy upscale establishment, so if you are looking for cultured you are coming to the wrong place.  What Andreolis is though is a great Italian deli that serves great food using fresh imported Italian ingredients.  If you are in Scottsdale stop by and order the ravs.  Your stomach and palette will thank you."
1,"Went to this location because my normal location was out of something. They were very nice here and held my items no problem.\n\nThis store has a very different vibe than the Summerlin store. It was kind of weird but fun. Everyone here was very nice and helpful.\n\nAs usual, they had a great selection of everything. The produce is always amazing and the meat and seafood counter is to die for. I would definitely go to this location again if I was ever on this side of town."
0,"HIT AND MISS. MOSTLY MISS. GO FOR THE TUNA STARTER AND ORDER A DOUBLE PORTION; REAL HIT!\n\nTHE FOOD\n-- tuna sashimi dish is great value, great flavors. order it.\n-- coconut rum with watermelon liqueur a winner, if only the bartender would remember to add the fruit. do you need a recipe book?\n-- hash with eggs arrives eggs-over-hard despite my instructions for easy\n-- toasted english muffin slathered with butter, but not toasted.\n-- chicken salad's chicken was bland except for the rub on the edge. boo.\n-- taco plate features raw, unprepared corn tortillas. yeah, i can pull one from the bag and dump something in it too! why would i pay for that?\n-- salsa too salty\n-- cole slaw just not interesting, ends up a plate filler. blech.\n\nTHE DECOR\n-- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls.\n-- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.\n\nTHE REST\n-- starting to develop a pet peeve for \""sauces\"" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish.

BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside."
0,"FAIL!\n\nI've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.\n\nFood:\nWe had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.\n\nAs with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.\n\nThe meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.\n\nThe seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.\n\nService:\nWe were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?\n\nHere is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to \""tap out\"" due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!\n\nPrice:\nWe were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.\n\nLunch price is fair.\n\nSuch high expectations and such a let down..."
0,I had a buy one get one free entree coupon which was the only reason why we went here.  Got the ribeye and she got the filet.  Both were fine but nothing compared to the best steakhouses in LV.  It was nice that the steaks came w/ a potato and salad.  Sides were below average.  The creamed spinach wasn't good and the sauteed mushrooms/onions was not worth $7. \n\nHad reasonably priced bottles of wine which were fine.  Bread served was the same as every other restaurant at Southpoint.\n\nI would definitely choose Outback over this place.  Not saying the steaks were bad..they were fine but just not worth going back for in a city with so many excellent places for steak.
1,"As an Italian, I eat way too much pasta. I was a bit skeptical trying out a place that makes \""fresh pasta\"" since we do it fresh at home but this place is definitely worth your time and money. The pasta is very fresh, the sauces are quite tasty and the people working there are super helpful. I would suggest this place if you're having guests over and want to make something super quick and good!"
1,"Looks can be deceiving!  \n\nWe have passed by this place dozens of times and never thought it was much more than what it looked like from the outside, just another bar in a strip mall.  How wrong we were!  Last night we wanted to go out and have some good Wisconsin 'pub' food, but wanted to try someplace different.  After looking through reviews of numerous places on this site and others, I decided to give this place a try.  My family was a little skeptical at first, but once we entered fears began to ease.  The size, layout, decor and most importantly the food were all top notch for a pub.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was picayune, but important to me.  Last night was Friday which means Fish Fry in Wisconsin.  Of course this meant I had to partake in the all you can eat version of it!  While the initial plate was plentiful and reasonably prepared, it took FOREVER to arrive and no one ever asked if I wanted more.  I'm sure this was probably due to them being packed, but even so it did detract a little for me from my overall take on the place.  That being said, we are eagerly awaiting our next visit there!"
1,I really enjoy this place. It's low-key and upscale. Drinks are expensive but they're made on the strong side. The food is really go too. I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy. \n\nIt's a great place to sit down and enjoy a cocktail and have a conversation. The crowd looks like 26 and up.  I consistently have a positive experience here.
1,closed - out of business!!!
1,"I've seen this show so many times I can almost act it out. \nWith that said I'm going to give it a review it deserves.\nFirst off what do you expect? It's comedy, it's visual and it's stimulating. \nThe comedy is almost slap stick at times and others it's just comedic genius. The music is loud. There is a lot of drumming.\nThere is no plot but there are \""scenes\""\nThere is some that deal with paint. Um Twinkies. The final frontier, Captian Crunch Cereal. And much more.\nThe end is probably the best. All I can say without giving it away is lots and lots of toilet paper. :)\nBut i met one of the musicans in the show. He said the blueman group is about humanity and how we are all connected. Apparently the idea goes deeper than that! \nA tip: you must get the blue man group speciality drink! It's blue!!! lol. Also the gift shop is pretty cool too. My roommate bought the first soundtrack and oddly enough i Fell in love with the music. Who knew."
0,"Maybe Naked City Pizza is having a bad night in both locations. Drove from Paradise location to here (see other review) on the promise that the order would be placed for us while we drove. How could they have, phone here has been off the hook for hours. We were ignored when we came in, and when we asked about ordering, a woman wearing a Naked City shirt pointed to the window in the back. Asked about the advance order, and literally got a look like I had asked for pizza on a golden platter. Mentioned the phone being off the hook. Again must actually have two heads, the look again while she held up the cordless phone and showed us it was fine. (Called back while we were eating at home, and the line was still busy.) So unbelievably rude...worst I have experienced in a long time. Don't care if the pizza is good. Won't be returning."
1,"They seem to be in the middle of a transition, changing the menu to add special entrees and such.\nThe manager was walking around tonight offering patrons random FULL entrees for free, just to try ! That type of atmosphere is what will guarantee my return - goodonya GG."
1,YEAH!!!!  Dunkin Donuts has finally opened in my neighborhood!  It is in the same shopping center as Walmart (not a fan)...Donuts are so yummy!  Do I really need to  write a review? Opened on June 24 (my birthday) it was the priority of the day to go and get an iced coffee and donut!  Jason the owner is super nice.  Go in and get your donut and coffee!!
0,"Absolutely terrible!!! I waited for 20 minutes to even get soaked for my pedi and then after an hour had passed and no one came to attend to me I just asked for a towel and left. I can't believe I wasted an hour just sitting there soaking my feet expecting that the lady would come and work on my nails. Do no go here, period!"
0,"First off, I realize that this is a school and with this knowledge I thought I would try it out. \n\nThe waiting room is a sad sad sight. I knew that the low price would bring in some questionable elements from the diversity of our society, but not this weird of a selection. Many old people.\n\nI came on a Saturday shortly after 8, thinking I was on the ball.. but I wasn't. I had almost an hour wait, but I was prepared to wait so that is all on me. One female looking confident and professional came out with a smile and said a name. Not my name. It's a shame because she had everything I was looking for in a massage therapist. \n\nShortly thereafter a woman comes out, and meekly states my name. I immediately get a bad feeling but I shake it off. I am here as an evaluator and just trying to see what this place have to offer. I ask her how long she has been doing this and she says she is halfway through the program. She asks me if there are any areas I want her to focus on and I say it would be great if she could focus on shoulders and the base of my skull. Nothing odd there right?\n\nAfter this comes close to an hour of really awkward pushing and poking. It was clear that my therapist didn't know what she was doing, and didn't have the confidence of doing it. She spends just as much time massaging, as she was correcting the sheets, towels and other stuff OCD style. It was really bad.\n \nAnother thing worth mentioning, she gave me possibly the best massage of my pectorals I have ever got... but then again spent almost no time on my shoulders, and didn't touch my neck, skull, shoulder blades or anything else that actually needed some attention. (Funny that she asked initially, but maybe that was just a box to check?!)\n\nConclusion: I realize that it must be hit and miss regarding what therapist you get, and therefore what experience you might have. In my case it was a miss. I will give this place one more chance."
1,"Not going to lie, I thought the place was closed when we walked up to it. It's not exceptionally well lit on the inside and the outside is adorable but misleading. Anyway, the inside is very chic. A heavy red tint on the walls and very modern, Asian-inspired seating. Not a massive selection of yogurt choices but they had \""white boy vanilla\"" so that makes up for anything else they may lack. Really impressive candy/fruit bar and by the cup counter they had tall, smoothie cups too. So that's cool that they serve more than just yogurt. Really cool place!"
0,My dad and I wanted to try their Philly Cheese steak and the place was good and food was good too but the reason why 1 star is because they can't give you the exact change they may round it out close to it and they only carry .25\u00a2 there and it's sad so they lost another customer
0,"They fraudulently charged a \""destination fee\"" of $23 on my credit card. They asked for the card for a security deposit, never mentioned these charges. I paid for my reservation through Orbitz.\n\nThey get one star, because any business that commits fraud does not deserve to be patronized. I had stayed with them three times previously, but no more."
1,"I joined some friends for a birthday dinner at Modern Steak. The restaurant a great ambiance - fun decor, swanky feel without feeling pretentious. The service was excellent... I definitely felt like a VIP for a night. \n\nWe started off at the bar and ordered a \""Retail Therapy\"" Martini: Belvedere Vodka, Grand Marnier, Strawberry, Basil & Lemon Juice. A good choice - it wasn't overly sweet and the basil added a nice touch. \n\nAppetizers consisted of Warm Asparagus Pizza, Crispy Prosciutto, Organic Fried Egg - Delicious! (I'm a big fan of the newly embraced French style of topping dishes with an egg) and Margherita Pizza, San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Basil - also very tasty. \n\nI was on a budget, so I sadly only ordered a salad, but a very good salad it was! I got the Roasted Beet Salad with pistachio, watercress and boucheron cheese. A nice, light summer salad that filled me up. \n\nI did try the filet that came with some carmelized onions - YUM! It was so good! People at the table were also raving about the Chilean Sea Bass. \n\nI definitely would like to go back and get a filet. It's pricey, but it's always fun to splurge on great steak sometimes."
0,"I believe reviews on Yelp should be based on personal opinion.  I have to give Joe's one star for their Ices. I am sure there are people in the world that love this particular texture, but it tastes like eating flavored sand to me. I am more of a \""wet\"" Italian ice person and Joe's makes them very \""dry\"". \nRita's is 4 miles down McClintock and well worth the trip. \n\nWe've tried this place three times and never gotten speedy or knowledgable service.They do get an additional star for the cute environment. \n\nOur only reason to go to Joe's is they are open an hour later than Rita's and your daughter won't stop crying until she gets an \""Icee Treat\"" to help her fever."
0,"*le sigh* \n\nI really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. \n\n\""I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again.\""\n\nI appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how \""quickly\"" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. \n\nThis establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. \n\nNow I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. \n\nI sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. \n\nP.S. To the servers - good luck, you were the best part of the place, always trying to make it work when you are as confused as the customer, and I hope she supplies plenty of aspirin for the hourly headaches you have to have from working there."
0,"My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said \""Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long\"".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were \""passable\"",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than \""acceptable\"" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was \""Really?\""  His response - \""Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM.\""  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far."
1,My wife and I and another couple visited this place this past Tuesday and it was awesome. Not only was shooting the machine guns great but the staff was unbelievably nice and accommodating. Highly recommend visiting and try to shoot down the target return string like I did with the M249 SAW ;)
1,"Had lunch here with a friend on what I think was maybe their second day open. We knew they were open, as my friend had called; however, there wasn't any signage to indicate name, that they were open, etc.\n\nI ordered the turkey/brie sandwich with sweet potato fries along with a fresh squeezed lemon-aid. I wasn't able to eat the bread that the menu indicated that the sandwich came with; however, they were out of it.  Seemed strange to be out of something on the 2nd day, but the sourdough was ok. Next time I know to specifically ask for wheat.  One note, I had assumed that the turkey would be white meat; however, it was mixed.  Not a huge issue, but it was something that I would have liked to know as I'm not really a huge fan of dark meat. \n\nMy friend ordered the iced green tea and the grilled portabella salad.  She seemed to really enjoy it, so I think I'll have to try it next time.\n\nWe went during lunch, but we were also given the breakfast menu.  I will certainly have to go back to try their breakfast items.  It looked YUMMY."
1,"I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. \n\nThey are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me."
1,"Besides pizzerias, this is one of our favorite kid friendly places to eat while in Mesa, AZ. The burgers, fries and shakes just hit the spot (like In n Out back home). The seating situation at this location is way better than the location in Mesa, AZ."
0,"\""Festival Seating\"", huh?  There was no warning when I bought tickets for this venue . . . and what a shock to see that there were no seats.  Security folks made us stand up well before the concert started, probably because folks were packed in there way past what would be deemed a safe volume of people.\n\nThe sound system was not good, acoustics were poor, the sound was over-processed.  It was a horrible experience; my worst concert to date.  I would suggest buying the artists DVD instead of going to see them live, at this venue."
1,"I tend to stay away from clubs in general because when I was in my 20's, I told myself I would not be like those \""older\"" women who still went clubbing.  Unfortunately, I still find myself frequenting the clubs from time to time and just tell myself that 30s are the new 20s.  Yeah, whatever.\n\nSo the view is really gorgeous, as stated in everyone's reviews.  My friend's co-worker had a host at the Palms, so we were able to get a VIP table--or maybe all tables are VIP?  Anyways, I have to say that what I enjoyed the most was eat being able to walk past the long line without having to wait to get into the damn club.  There was a two-bottle minimum for our table.  Since we only had four people, we pretty much had one bottle left over.  However, since my friend and I were staying at the Palms, we were able to take it back to our room---one of the bouncers had to escort us carrying the bottle himself and we were able to go down in a different private elevator.\n\nThe crowd seemed like your average Vegas bunch---half naked women and drunk men.  Music was okay.  I don't recall the ceiling over the dancefloor ever retracting, though.  The place is pretty big, including an upstairs and two balconies.  The waitresses are pretty hot as well--it was kinda weird having them pour all our drinks for us and stand over our table every so often.  Talk about service....every time our bucket was slightly empty, some guy would refill it...whenever we finished our drink, someone would immediately take the empty glass away and clean the table...the carafes of cranberry and orange juice wouldn't even be 1/2 empty and they'd take it away only to replace it with a full one.  Man, I could get used to going VIP.  I have no idea how much it all cost bc someone else took care of the bill, thank God, but I'm sure it was near $1000 w/ tip if one bottle of Grey Goose is $475.   I doubt I'd go back, but at least I got to check it out once!"
0,"DO NOT GO HERE.   They are great until there is a problem.  My  comforter was  BURNED and neatly packed. Brought it back and was told to leave it there to be looked over because I might've burned it myself, and they'll get back to me. I have to come 14 miles one way so I asked her to call him but she didn't have any sort of contact number. She then says she does not know her managers name nor the owner's name because she just works there, and sees them whenever they show up.   Sounds absolutely ridiculous, I know. There wasn't even a business card, so I left my contact info for a call back which I never received.  They play dumb and it is frustrating  and unprofessional.  My comforter also has a strong lingering perfume scent that I can't get rid of.  Poor customer satisfaction, and they don't care how you feel about it, they just take your money!"
0,"What can I say about this show? Lots of mixed feelings.\n\nFirst of all, I don't care how famous you are. When it says the show starts at 11, doors open at 10:30, at least try to stay close to the schedule. I can be forgiving if its 10, maybe 15 minutes late, BUT DAMN! You start the show at 11:45? To add to that, there was no explanation whatsoever as to the late start. Now if this was on a friday night, then maybe it just might be okay. But since it was on a thursday, I have to get up for work at 6 am. So by the time I got to bed, it was 2 am. \n\nSo we sit down at 11:15 thinking it should start soon, maybe 10 minutes. For the next half hour, we hear about 3 announcements stating for us to go get some Tyku alcohol. By the time the show started, some people have left already and some were sound asleep. One thing is for sure, whoever was left was definitely tired.\n\nFinally it starts and there is a wild round of applause, probably because it was about damn time! Here is a quick description of the show. CeeLo sings covers of other songs including his own hits while the large screen behind him shows off a lot of graphics, while his sexy backup dancers are dancing along side of him. From time to time he has other performers sing which is a good thing because being the large man that he is, he needs the rest. \n\nThe two stars are for when things did go right, it was actually very entertaining.\n\nNow for the things that went wrong. The number one thing that bothered me and im sure a lot of people were thinking the same thing was that all the singing performers were singing to recorded music and you can tell that they were lip syncing a couple times. The sound quality was off several times meaning the music was louder than the singer and vice versa. Lastly, the flow of the show was very erratic. There was a period when CeeLo finished a song, walked off the stage, and all the lights went out. I would say for about 5 minutes we sat there and wondered if the show was done or if was a real intermission. Then all of a sudden the next song starts. Huh? No flow whatsoever.\n\nI got free tickets to this show but if I paid for it, I would be really disappointed. CeeLo, if you are reading this, im sure you are yelling at your producer or whoever is responsible for how this show is run. Im sure it's not your fault. You are good at what you do and there's no denying that. In my opinion, more work needs to be done. Usually the best singing shows have a live band. That right there would be a start. Maybe the next time I see your show again, you will have all the kinks worked out. Only then, maybe I can bump you up to 4 or 5 stars."
0,I went once and wasn't impressed.  I tried it again and it didn't fare any better.
0,"I really wanted to like Tommy V's -- unfortunately this review will be less than flattering.  I'll begin with what I did like:\n\nThe happy hour drink specials: $5 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $5 house cocktails from 5-7.  Not bad.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nThe pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for \""personal\"" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.\n\nThe service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.\n\nWe gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back."
0,"So they claim to be open till 11pm. We just walked in at 10:14 and we're greeted at the door with \""I'm sorry we already did last call just a little bit ago and we are gunna close a little early.\"" There were at least 15 people still in the restaurant and closing a little early doesn't mean doing last call an hour before you close. How unprofessional and just plain bad service. I understand it's tuesday and everyone wants to go home but you decided to be in the service industry. Needless to say we won't ever be back to support this place."
1,"GO TO THE BARRELHOUSE!  I've been there a few times and they always have great food and service. It's in a very random strip mall, but perhaps that helps to keep the prices reasonable. Great drinks!! Don't hesitate!"
0,"We were so looking forward to having a neighborhood Sushi place to go to.  Service was good however the sushi was average and way over priced.  We had two hand rolls, two sushi rolls and not alcohol.  The rolls did not have an abundance amount of sushi but the price tag was $75.00 for our order.  For this I would have gone to Ocean Club!  Probably will not be going back."
1,"I was NOT impressed the first time I came here. It was crowded, I had to fight like the dickens to get a drink from the bar. And an annoying mix of greasy douches, clubgirls and obvious tourists trying to be country-trendy.\n\nI can't say it was much different the second time around except that this time I was buzzed by the time I got there and I had my crew with me. So we could have been at a leper colony and still would have had a blast. \n\nGeorgia Chrome was cranking out live tunes and they had very nice girls feeding us whiskey from the bar. So several beers and some moonshine later we wound up having a damn good time. It turns out I'm a decent two-stepper....who knew?\n\nWhile this still isn't my first idea of a good time I would come again, but here's some advice:\n\n-Have a few drinks elsewhere first. I don't recommend coming here until you're a little \n buzzed.\n\n-Have a sense of humor and be prepared for crowds\n\n-Ladies: There are a plethora of sleazy guys here who WILL hit on you.\n-Guys: There are a plethora of sleazy dudes who will not hesitate to hit on your girl\n\n-As Blake Shelton would put it, the more you drink, the more fun you will have. The \n  moonshine is your express ticket to drunken funness but although it's not the real \n  stuff, you will hurt the next day.\n\nGood times, worth checking out if you take the above precautions."
1,"I think their patio is great, excellent people watching. It's always full of scottsdale cougars, makes me feel like I am on one of those Real Housewives shows. The happy hour is a great deal. 1/2 off drinks, 1/2 off appetizers. The martinis are very tasty and always come with the shaker so you get a full drink and not a short pour. I wish City North wasn't so abandoned because it looked like it could have been a nice street. I will go back many more times. P.S. Don't forget to check in through yelp on your first visit for a free drink (which could be about 15$ worth if you order it right)."
1,"I love this place. It's got delicious veg and vegan food and treats. Great chai lattes. Fun furniture. Booze. Free WiFi. It's a great place for doing some study or reading a book as well.\n\nI haven't been to any of the shows yet, but they have live music in the back all the time."
1,The perfect non-fast food place to have lunch on our drive home from Vegas. The gyro meat was yummy and not too salty. I absolutely loved the tzatziki sauce which had chunks of cucumbers and pickles in it.  The side of rice that came with it was also good.
0,"I mean its a gym. \n\nthis one in particular is overly crowded, mostly with stereotypical Scottsdale people - with the women in full hair and makeup and the dudes in bro tanks. \n\nbut for a gym - it gets the job done. \ndon't go between 430-730pm though because you will never get on a machine or the equipment. i have literally stalked machines before. \n\ni have been a member for the last 3 years - i do a lot of everything things to, but will continue my membership because it is so cheap! don't get suckered into paying over $30/month though.... don't pay more than $20"
0,Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !
1,"This place is sanity off the strip.  \n\nLocated in a strip mall cluster of Asian stores that look boarded up and whose names are hard to read, Lotus of Siam eluded me on the first attempt, but I'm glad I pursued it by way of a back street that revealed just how big this shopping center is.  This might help: it is right next door to Namaste Indian.  The restaurant is one of many that line a massive deserted parking lot that will make you think twice about getting out of your car, but inside the feeling was totally different.  \n\nThe servers were super friendly and helpful, and there were sane people there, sitting at tables, wearing clothes, on lunch breaks from office jobs or sober enough today to make it a few miles off the strip with cheerful faces, the ability to form coherent sentences, and the sense to seek out real food at reasonable prices.  What a relief!\n\nI'm not a fan of buffet, and looking at this one didn't change my mind.  The selection was limited and the items looked like typical buffet food.  However, for those interested, the couple of main entrees looked decent and smelled good, and the $8.99 it costs seems more than fair.  \n\nI opted for the menu and was completely satisfied.  Interestingly, they have a northern Thai food section, and I got the first dish listed.  It is an egg noodle dish served in a red coconut curry broth.  Even though it wasn't on the menu I was able to get tofu instead of chicken or beef.  The bowl of steaming sweet, spicy, sour, and creamy deliciousness is topped with cilantro, green onion, and a few fried noodles and served with a plate of \""sliced\"" red onion, pickled cabbage, and a lime wedge.  The broth was absolutely delicious!  I savored each spoonful, and before I knew it had eaten the entire bowl.  It was the perfect portion for lunch.  \n\nAs for the garnish, the pickled cabbage had an interesting earthy taste underneath the vinegar, but I don't know what vegetable it was exactly.  The server thought it might be napa.  The only thing I would change would be the red onions which I think would have been much better if they were actually sliced rather than coarsely chopped as they were.  I love just about any vegetable ingredient, but huge chunks of raw onion are an exception.  \n\nMy general feeling for this place is gratitude and affection.  The food was excellent, the servers earnest, and the atmosphere perfect for decompressing from the chaos of the strip.  I would definitely come back if I happened through Vegas again, but then I might get too curious about the neighboring restaurants..."
0,"My husband and I just got married at the Aria and in our wedding package, we were given a mini wedding cake from Jean Philippe Patisserie.\n\nWe were given pictures of about fifteen different cakes and had to pick one. They were adorable. It was the hardest decision of our entire wedding, because we wanted them all! They were like mini-works of art.\n\nWe arrived in Vegas and saw all of the cakes in the store/restaurant. We got even more excited. They were just as amazing in person.\n\nOn our wedding day, we were given our mini cake (could feed 6-8 maybe) in a plastic case. We took lots of pictures and kept it in our Sky Suite to have for breakfast the next morning.\n\nThe next morning it had melted a bit and the top tier was sliding. It didn't matter, we just wanted to eat it. We went to the concierge lounge to get cutlery and dove in.\n\nAs beautiful as our cake looked, it did not taste very good. The exterior coating was thick and sickly sweet. It was awful. The interior cake and creme was okay, but not great. We took a few bites and dumped it. \n\nIt was a huge let down.\n\nI would definitely not recommend the cakes. Look at them ( they are so, so cute), but don't buy one. However, what we saw of the restaurant looked good and we might give it a try on our next trip."
1,"Had dinner on 05/02/08; we had no reservations and just walked in, which made it a plus. The service was great, the decor and atmosphere made it fun, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesome..definately recommend these two!"
0,"Nice local bar for being \""local\"" to people in the building, with very friendly staff and good service.  The bar part was a bit small, with people at tables that probably would have rather just sat at the bar.  Prices were fairly extreme.  I went in with a friend, we had 1 beer each, and no food, and got $16.50 bill.  For 2 people having 2 draft beers after work on Friday evening before going out, was excessive.  Won't be back based on price alone.  Was \""nice\"" but not THAT nice."
0,"On my first visit to Phoenix, this restaurant was across from my hotel.  At first I was skeptical: would Greek food in the southwest be any good? Then I told myself I was being unfair to Phoenix and decided to give it a try.  I should have listened to my gut. \n\nFor a restaurant with \""Greek\"" in the title, I'm amazed at just how bad the \""Greek\"" food was.  I tried both the moussaka and the pastitsio, and both were completely underwhelming.  First of all, both were topped with Italian-style tomato sauce and Parmesan.  No sign of the bechamel that is supposed to be atop the pastitsio (even says it on the menu!).  The \""macaroni\"" filling was actually giant pieces of penne, and there was no hint of Greek spice anywhere.  The moussaka was even worse: same Italian sauce and cheese on top, but filled with what appeared to be peelings from zucchini and eggplant, all rather al dente.  I sent it back.  The pita wedges and the hummus on the appetizer plate were very good and the best thing I ate.  \n\nService and management were both quite good; they kept my water filled and offered to bring me something else for free when it became clear I wasn't happy with my food.  I won't be back."
1,"This is definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas. It's a steakhouse, however we never tried the steak there. We always go with the seafood and French onion soup."
1,"From the moment you walk into the theatre, you are engulfed in the environment of the show.  Not really a bad seat in the house!  There are speakers located in each of the comfy seats so you really feel involved in the show the entire time.\n\nOne of the employees gave us some interesting facts about the show and took time out to show us around!!  Thanks for the hospitality.\n\nGreat locals discount also.  Like that Cirque show alot!!"
1,"I have been wanting to go to the one and only \""Cambodian\"" restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and LOVED it from the moment we entered. An aura of love, peace and harmony welcomed us in. LOVED the food!!!!!! It was my husband's 1st adventure  into Cambodian cuisine. He is an adventurous spirit and loves most cuisines so I knew he would treasure the unique flavors of Cambodia. It was cooked by Mom who used to work for Intel. Served by son and daughter. Even though it was busy he found time to converse with us. It was one of those lingering, thought provoking, conversation provoking experiences that stays with you until your next visit."
1,"This is best record shop I've been to while in Montreal. The selection of music definitely fits the bill of indie and interesting. They even had a good selection of Numero Group albums, the incredible soul and funk label out of Chicago.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get tickets to pretty much any indie show in the city here at face value. They'll charge you a slight fee for paying with credit, but it's still the cheapest place to stock up on tickets. The guys who work here are super helpful and didn't mind one bit that we didn't French.  I wished I lived closer so I could visit more often. Highly recommended."
0,"Hostess rude. Service was extremely slow and the food was below average and cold. Was supposed to get French tip squares for spinach dip but instead got stale tortilla chips. When asked waitress about it she was rude. Took forever to get food and then no one ever returned to ask how it was or if I needed anything else. In fact after 30 minutes I finally walked to the bar to ask for another beer. I regret leaving the small tip that I did leave. I would never, ever go back. The chicken strips were dry, overcooked, and tiny. Bad meal and bad service."
0,"Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:\n\n1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.\n\n2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)\n\nBeing a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that."
1,I've only been here once and that was on a Thursday while a 90's rock cover band was playing. The band was way beyond fun (I honestly would have still enjoyed myself while sober) and being able to play beer pong added to the excitement.
1,"The airport is not a bad airport at all. It's actually better than a lot of airports! I love that the roadways leading in and out of the airport is not too confusing. The only terminal that is confusing is #2 because it's not connected to the main building. \n\nBut it's nice inside. It has all of the usual restaurants and magazine stores and coffee shops. The coolest place is La Grande Orange. I was surprised that there was one in there in terminal 4. Good restaurant for food!\n\nThe place is pretty clean too. It's very well kept. They started upgrading the entire place. Now there's LCD boards giving you information on the roadways, recharge stations inside and a sky train that takes you to the light rail station. For free. To ride the light rail is not free. But you can be dropped off at the airport light rail station and take the sky train directly to the main check-in building. \n\nThe airport only keeps getting better. :)"
0,"i ate here for the first time this weekend and was uber excited to try this place out!  i was disappointed for a handful of reasons...will i go back? probably not...vegas is kind of a mecca for food....so many different cuisines and types of food there, i definitely would not go back...\n\nfirst off...its expensive...TOO expensive if you ask me...\n\ni understand that spanish tapas and \""tapas\"" in general are small plates with smaller portions BUT cmon man...how are you going to charge what you charge for this food?  \n\nso here is what i ordered...\n\nmini burgers with peppers and alioli...these 3 sliders tasted like sliders. normal sliders...it supposed to be made from special spanish pigs, but they tasted like normal state side pigs to me.\n\npressed ham sando with manchego cheese and truffles...i really cant say anything negative about this sandwich...i loved it...like to the point where i could just order 3 or 4 orders and just eat them one by one...very truffley, very buttery, salty from the ham, and very cheesy...great sandwich indeed.\n\nspanish omelet with potatoes and onions...i make this at home all the time. its just an omelet with runny egg and 5 slices of thin potato slices in there...wth?  so boring.\n\nhomemade pork sausage stew with pearl onions and mushrooms...i really wanted to like this dish, but for as much flavor that there was here...it was overpoweringly salty...like to the point where i wanted to gag salty...\n\nseared scallops with romesco sauce...these scallops were cooked well...they give you 2 scallops for 15 bucks...at Yardhouse you order extra scallops with their tomato cream sauce and its 20 bucks for 8 scallops the same size and taste similar...\n\ngrilled skirt steak with pepper confit...overcooked. and chewy. not great in any way.\n\nim reading that the service there is phenomenal...our servers werent. they werent bad in any way, but i mean cmon....thats your job...so just do it...\n\noh yeah...not only did i get a mean stomach ache and indigestion that kept me up all night...my g.f. ended up yacking from the food as well...i dunno what it was exactly, but something was not cooked right...i eat spanish tapas all over the place and im always fine to go the next day...not hunched over the porcelain bowl the next morning...\n\n(why 2 stars? like i wrote earlier. that pressed ham sandwich with truffle and manchego is truly a delight.  take my advice and just order 4 of them and go about your trip)"
1,"Yum if you like buttery selections (eg. Broccoli , mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes).  They do have a nice selection of Asian foods.  We went for lunch.  The dude cutting the meats have a positive attidude and makes the experience more enjoyable .  Though the price is a little high $41.99 for weekend brunch, but definitely worth a try.  You can save a whole buck if you are a current Caesar card holder, woot."
1,Gilbert is really a nice guy and very professional. He came on time of my flight. Fitted my luggage nicely. I had 5 huge luggage and some small ones too. He drives very carefully.
1,"Decent locals sportsbar with a good bar menu and choice of beer, the food didn't disappoint and the prices were really surprisingly great.  They have daily specials, and I ate here on my way back to LA.  I took advantage of their burger special, which was $10 for a US Kobe burger (from Montana, at least they're honest).  Other burgers were all $7 which was half price, I think it was a happy hour special.  I also ordered their tortilla soup which as decent.  The burger was ok.  I ordered it Medium, but it seemed a little dry an certainly no different than non-\""Kobe burgers\"" in texture or taste.  The one thing that did stick out though was that it was served on Hawaiian King buns, which gave it a little sweetness and I really liked.  Service was very friendly, my waiter came and checked on me every 15 min or so and he seemed like he was really eager for me to enjoy the food.  If I lived closer, I'd probably be a regular."
0,"Update - finally went to the new Lincoln Square Mall location. The decor is just awful, which is sad considering how nice the old place was. Cramped seating, depressing track lighting, drop ceilings, weird art right behind your seats so you keep bumping into it. They were out of the first two things I ordered (one was a special, so fine, but out of a basic bread-based app?)\n\nPasta took forever to come out, and my friend's was so cold that the cream sauce had congealed. Sigh."
1,"What a great find! Coffee is strong and tasty. Oatmeal is very good as are the breakfast sandwiches with very fresh and high quality ingredients. Efficient, prompt and very friendly service. We'll be back!"
1,Pizza is good...we've ordered lasagna for take out too before and its good. Friendly service.
1,Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price
0,"Had a bad experience, you couldn't get a place to sit unless you spent $700 plus on bottle service. Had half the club roped of and empty. FYI it was $45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes, it was that much of a downer"
0,"This place is off to a bad start attitude wise. The bouncers (not all of them but most) treat you like some bum off the street.\nI have been around the Scottsdale nightlife scene for 7+ years, so I know lots of people including club owners, etc and a few calls and VIP and in is no problem, but that's not my style because personally I think VIP is cheesy and has mostly wanna be people. Can't tell you how many times I have walked out of VIP after being invited in. Would rather hang outside VIP any day.\n\nAnyway back to the \""W\"". On the soft-opening they had in September I went to the \""W\"". A few people gathered around the door and not super busy inside so I figured I would just wait. Well after the door guy letting in a million people, he would not let me in. Was not like I had a crowd with me, I was solo, and I was dressed very upscale. So before I left I asked him his name just for the record, small world and I give people only one chance. I went around the other entrance, I knew the door guy and was in. Walked around for 10 minutes saw all the people who go to these openings to be seen, ran into some people I knew and left. Nothing worse than hanging out in a room of fake \""worried about how the world views them\"" people. All trying to emulate some sort of social status.\n\nThe prices seemed decent, Mondrian started charging $6 for a Bud Light then you add $1 for tip its $7. There is a difference between expensive and just plain gouging. I think \""W\"" is still good on this area.\n\nA few weeks later went back and though there was no over the top scrutinizing at the door but it still had that bad unfriendly attitude.\nThe atmosphere around the pool is cool and the architecture is cool. So if your into that check it out but be ready for the \""Kent Dorfman's\"" doormen deciding your fate if you can come in or not.\n\n\nI'll probably give the place another chance but right now it scores low."
0,"Made reservation a day in advance; they didn't have our table, only option was to sit outside.  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, took the table;  service was extremely slow.  Took them a while for the server to come take the order.  Bread was served after repeated requests; sides were served COLD, when asked, they were served reheated not fresh.  PRICEY by any standard, it's not New York.. \nTheir lucky day, my wife and daughter loved their food and Tiramisu - 2 stars.  Yay!!!!"
0,Never have I ever gone to a place paid my money then ask for it back!! The food in this place is so bad I wanted it back. Ok first of all while waiting in line I was looking around and was liking the decor and the seating arrangements the red rock has got to be the best casino for foot traffic. But the people they hire to prepare the food needs improvement. Let's start with the Asian section think of the worst Asian buffet place you have been to. It's still better the stuff they try to call Asian food here. (I'm not the only one who thinks so cause when I sat down to try it my self an Asian couple had left their plates full of the food from the Asian) Now the American food they had macaroni and cheese that I regretted getting the butterfly shrimp they had was ok needed a little ingredient known as salt. Everything their could have used some salt. There was no flavor in anything other than the soft serve ice cream I got. They don't even know how to make Italian food it's really disappointing. I wouldn't give it any stars but the decor and atmosphere give it one star. Red Rock employees if your reading this you need somebody to come and show the people in the Feast how to cook because what they are doing now is insulting. Just because it is a buffet doesn't mean putting out crap is acceptable.
0,"1 - 5 scale\nFood: 2\nService: 4 \nAtmosphere: 5\nService: 5\n\nI really like the decor as well as the staff at La Comida. Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: \""if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty\"". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were \""meh\"" and the Guacamole dip was even more \""meh\"".  \n\nI don't feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun."
1,I love their rice plates!! The chef also adds a little artistic touch to the food too!
1,The thing that really stands out about Momoyama was the service. I enjoy the fact that I can go into the restaurant after a few weeks and the waitress knows what I want to drink.  Great service goes a long way for me.\n\nThe food is pretty good. It is All You Can Eat. I will go here again and again.
0,"I will never shop at Artie's Ace ever again. First, I ask one of their employees for help and his response is \""no English\"". He literally did not speak one word of English. Second, I went to return Christmas lights and after debating amongst themselves whether they accepted returns they tell me it will be a 25% restocking fee. Nowhere on their receipt does it say that. I dispute this unclear policy which they did not like being questioned. Next, the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box.  Okay I will box them. But wait she says the lights must be tested. Great test them. Nope need to be boxed. Needless to say at this point I am extremely frustrated and getting mad. Finally, their \""manager\"" comes out and he says he has heard enough of me talking to his \""girls\"". What is he their pimp? Btw, he looks like a pimp with his fake tan in the middle of December and bleached hair. We go back and forth which at this point he starts yelling for his employees to call the police because he is kicking me out. His store is by \""invitation\"" only and I am not welcome there. Fine I start walking out and we keep talking outside where he tells I cannot return the lights because I did not put them in the box and that he is not my \""maid\"". He makes more threats about calling the police and taking my license plate number down. Awesome! I ask him for his name. He refuses and asks for my name. I tell him it. I ask again for his name and refuses again. I ask if he is the owner. Nope. Are you the manager? Yes. Awesome! I leave with the lights and will never shop here again. Horrible customer service!"
1,Really cool place! Order each donut customized and fresh from the fryer! Best if eaten right away! Only $1 per donut!
0,"The staff are ridiculously rude!  \n\nThe restaurant was more than 1/2 empty, but still they made us wait because we were 10 minutes early for our reservation.  They told us we could have a seat near the door to wait.  Then another waitress came over and told us we were not allowed to sit there because we had 1 in our party who was under 21.  When we asked where we could sit and wait, we were told (in a very rude tone) that we could leave the restaurant and go search for some benches.  I walked out and told them to cancel my restaurant. I would not spend my money in a place where I was not treated with respect!"

1,"This place is in my Top 5 favorite places to eat in Arizona, no question!  First of all, they're a brewing company so they have to have good beer, right?  Check!  In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!\n\nAll of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  \n\nWhile I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said \""I think this is better than Guinness.\""  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!\n\nFavorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)\n\nThe patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.  Plus, I suggest taking a cab or the light rail anyway . . . better to not have to drive so that you can enjoy more brews!"
1,"Friday was IPA night, which caught my attention immediately.  I got the Bourbon Street burger and added fresh jalapenos (no one does this - which really bothers me.  Most of us LOVE fresh rather than picked / from the jar).  It was delicious, as was the queso dip we shared as an appetizer.\n\nSome dude was there playing guitar and singing, which was a nice added bonus.  Live music is a plus when it doesn't suck.  The service was so-so, I'm not 100% sure she was happy to be there, but the food delivered and we will definitely be back!"
1,"On me newfound never end quest for awesome thai food, I am happy Bahn Thai opened up and wish them much success.  They have only been open about a month and a half and have all the class of an established restaurant.\n\nSaturday night, I called ahead since I hate waiting.  It was not needed however and we walked into a nicely decorated casual type atmosphere.  A few TV's were strategically stationed throughout which provided a nice outlet for ignoring your dinner companions if you so choose :-).  Sushi bar in the back and booths on each side.\n\nService was attentive which is very nice especially in Thai restaurants so that they can explain the level of spiciness and the intricacies of the dishes.  Our waiter was friendly and did a great job of recommending dishes to suit our taste.  When one of my co diners chose a level 3 for spiciness, I had to pop in and make them back it down.  First rule of Thai food is you can always add, but you can't take away you know?  \n\nWe started with the Fresh Summer Rolls which were mui tasty.  Shrimp, lettuce, carrots, thai basil and rice noodles rolled tightly in rice paper with a well put together plum sauce on the side.  The plum sauce and the plump shrimp are key to making this dish awesome.\n\nNext up, Pud Kee Mow, chicken.  Al Dente wide rice noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, peppers, carrot, mushrooms and thai basil.  This dish was nicely fragrant thanks to the abundant use of the thai basil and blended together nicely in a rice dish that did not disappoint.  Nicely flavorful and piping hot.  I'm glad I chose the level 2 spiciness because my pansy a** couldn't have handled anything hotter.  My only issue is that the chicken was slightly tough which is about standard for these types of restaurants so I'll probably switch proteins the next time I go.\n\nThat being said, I think Ballantyne has a big hit on their hands.  Great work Bahn Thai, see you again soon."
1,"Great neighborhood place that serves delicious food late into the night.\n\nFirst room has a bar and a few tables... through there is a second room all for dining with a window view to the street.\n\nUnpretentious, authentic, tasty Italian.  Sea Scallops were perfect."
0,The price was way too high for an average car wash at $13 for the basic wash.
0,"I have mixed feelings about my experience at the duce. I took my mother, sister and girlfriend there on a Tuesday night and had a fun time overall. The positives are that the food is good, the building was large, and they had a unique list of beers: old style, schlitzz, and other Chicago-only beers.\n\nUnfortunately, the waitress that took our order was very rude, the bartenders were blatantly talking about how to get more tips out of their customers,  and the macaroni and cheese muffins were not as good as Guy Fieri made them out to be. \n\nI would not recommend this place because of the service, the limited parking, and the uncomfortable seating. I could not see myself coming back unless they improved their menu, and worked on their customer service."
1,I come here for my redbull fix.  They now sell 19oz redbulls.  It helps me get through the rest of the day.  Love it.  Can't wait until they start making the 40oz redubll.
1,"I have been going here for about a a year and a half now and I love this place. I bought a groupon originally and have been going back with my membership card, best groupon I ever bought. I usually see 'Shay and she is amazing. She applies the right amount of pressure and I love the oils and scents she uses. All of the therapists I have seen have been great. Everyone is always really friendly, they do a great job of creating a relaxing environment. \n\nThe only slight drawback I have seen is sometimes my 1 hour massage will run a little short. I have been there a few times when the therapist was running a little behind and my appointment started late, which is fine, but it still ended on the hour. \n\nI will also say they have a very easy and convenient online booking system."
0,"This place is awful.  It's always totally empty, and for good reason.  I went for lunch today since it's walking distance from my workplace, but I will never go back.\n\nI got yelled at for asking questions about the menu, it took forever to get my food, the food wasn't that good--and then it made me feel sick all afternoon.  I got the lunch special with vegetables and tofu, steamed rice, and hot and sour soup.  It was all bland--amazing, since this restaurant is one of the few Chinese places that still uses MSG.\n\nIt looks like they used to do a buffet, but now the food tubs on the buffets are filled with old magazines and trash.  Not even kidding...I don't usually write entirely bad reviews, but I can't think of a single good thing about Yen's.\n\nIf it were the zombie apocalypse and I were locked in this restaurant, I still wouldn't eat the food.  Gross."

0,"The service was pathetic, We were there for two hours and only received a few dishes that we ordered.  The dishes that we did receive was warm. We asked for the check and told her it was because it took so long. She then got upset at us as if it were our fault that their service was complete garbage.  On top of their horrible service, the place mats was I kid you not, printer paper.  The napkins were cheap square kind too, definitely not something you would present to customers at a restaurant.\n\nIn conclusion, I would rather put out a fire with my face then eat at this establishment again."

0,"Centennial Toyota has been our go to spot for car shopping for years. My family got a total of four cars from them (one lease) and while the salespeople are usually polite and not very pushy, the price you get might not be great and the service for the few visits i personally had were pretty horrendous.\n\nMy recent experience at Toyota was less than pleasant though. It was a big waste of time. I convinced my girlfriend and her sister to check out centennial toyota simply because my history with them and naturally i expected a rather fantastic quote from them. I did my research and called several dealership as well as printed the true price paper from U.S news cars website, I even had a friend who sent me their receipt from Henderson toyota for the exactly the same car. \n\nI started off by letting my gf test drive the car and then the scary negotiation begins. The salesperson was very polite but let me say my previous purchase and my loyalty played absolutely no part in the negotiation process. I was quoted $3000 more than the true car pricing gotten off of the cars website and about $3500 more than what our friend got at Henderson. What bothers me the most is that the salesperson kept asking for my bottom line. It's safe to say that he missed the point, he was playing the bargaining game with me and I just wanted a hassle-free experience. After we told him we will visit another dealership and my gf's mom has to co-sign with her on the car even if we buy it right now, he looked dismayed and became obviously less excited about us. He somewhat hastily ended the conversation and gave us a not so great price written on the back of his business card and we left very unsatisfied. He never mentioned anything about the $25 test drive gift card btw even though I showed him the coupon that they sent us. The whole thing took almost two hours.\n\nWe went straight to fletcher jones afterward, and guess what, we bought our car there the same day. Their initial offer and the only offer for the same car beats the Centennial quote by around $4000 and the recent graduate discount was $750 vs. $500 from centennial. Yes, the cars were exactly the same with door protector being the only difference. We had NO negotiation because we felt the price was great and all of us were surprised how easy it was. With signing and everything it took about 3 hours total. \n\nCentennial later sent me an email after I told them my disappointment. The manager simply told me that I should've just called them and that they will not be beaten by any body on price. That's completely missing the point. If they offered me a good price and played no bargaining game with me in the first place, I would probably spent a little more to save the trouble. It's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone. \n\nWill I go back to Centennial Toyota? Probably, since buying a car is all about playing these games. I am not sure if buying at Fletcher Jones can as easy as this one. But will I ever convince somebody to go to Centennial simply because my so called \""Loyalty\"", absolutely not. There is no loyalty, at least not with what happened to me."
0,"First let me say, it's awesome that a coffee place opened up where the service is at least decent.  Nice folks behind the counter. \n\nHowever, I got a frozen coffee and quite frankly, it wasn't any different than if I had made it myself ... with the brewed coffee I keep in my fridge for the week.  In fact, I make it even better because I make sure there are no ice chunks in my frozen beverage.\n\nNothing special about their iced tea either.  As my husband said, \""it was nothing like drinking polar bear\"" which is what he describes as really awesome iced tea.  (I know strange but that's his thing)\n\nI will give this place a couple more tries: 1) B'C they said they make homemade muffins and well, I love muffins and 2) when they open up the restaurant portion b'c I'm really hoping to have an awesome place nearby to get a meal.\n\nIf you want me to keep coming back, go talk to the folks at Sugar N Spice down on Indian School RD.  We literally crave that place.  They have an awesome staff and an awesome bakery with awesome beverages.  I'd love to be able to have a hang out place like that closer to home!\n\nWith all that said, I realize they are just starting out and to support local businesses I'd like to give this place another try but I don't want to just \""settle\"" coming here because it's close by.  I want to love going there!"
1,Host knows just what customer service is. Friendly and handed us complimentary VIP wristbands.  More mature crowd than other nearby places (which is a good thing). Music is good.
1,"This is the best Starbucks I've ever been to. I just moved here from Alabama, and being a Starbucks fan I have been to A LOT of them, but this is my absolute favorite. All of the workers are so polite and sweet, and always doing their best to go as fast as possible. I've been going there every other day just about since I moved here a month ago, and today my debit card wasn't working so I was buying a sausage biscuit with what little cash I had, and the sweet cashier was like we're going to give you your usual drink too, no worries, it's on us. Wow, that was so kind. Also, once I had to wait a little bit for my biscuit so I went up to check on it, and they gave me a card for a free drink next time just for my wait. Super nice workers. No better customer service anywhere!"
1,"Stayed here recently because we got married in Caesars Palace. We stayed in a \""deluxe room\"" in the Augustus Tower. We originally werent placed there but our taxi driver said to ask for that tower cause it over looks the Bellagio water show. Well we got the tower... but on the wrong side. Instead of seeing the water show, we got to see the roof of the building under us. Oh well.\n\nThe room was HUGE. I wish I had taken pictures. The bathroom was HUGE!!! The bathtub had jets in them and there was a tv on the opposite side of the tub! Watching tv while taking a shower was an amazing experience haha.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable and the pillows were amazing. I wish I knew what type they were so I could buy some! Our room was right next to the hallway where people get off the elevator (why do we always get placed near the elevator) but it was quiet. \n\nOverall, I would definitely stay here again!!"
0,"Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.  These people are thieves."
1,"I was visiting family and took my sister's car to get a wash after our long road trip from Chicago. \n\nThey did a great job here. They were friendly, had a military discount, did a very thorough cleaning and were very nice. They removed her antenna's and had a nice system of cleaning the cars. The only complaint I had was that it took way too long from start to finish. We were there almost an hour, if not just over an hour. \n\nIt was just too long but they did a great job and we were very happy with it."
0,"There are good points and bad points about the Flamingo.  I will list the good points:\nLocation: this is on the center strip, which is close to a lot of other hotels (for shows, conferences)\nMargaritaville: A nice restaurant with an upper deck view\nThe garden: The garden has Flamingoes and is very peaceful\nThe staff: very nice, polite\nCons: This hotel reeks of smoke, everywhere,  I used to smoke, so I understand and am not condemning. But when you ask for a non-smoking room, it should not smell like someone has nuck into your room and is hiding to smoke a cigarette. This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). \nIf you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, \nThere was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.\nWhen the room was booked, I booked a room with a refrigerator, and was provided with a styrofoam cooler.\n There was a leak, in the first room . This leak was coming through the light fixture in the bathroom. This was due to a problem with something upstairs. The room was put out of order which meant that baggage and belongings had to be carried to another room."
0,Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.
1,"I was referred to this company by another landscaping company who didn't serve the east valley. Dave responded almost immediately to my email inquiry and was able to come out to my house on my next available day. He gave me an upfront quote (although a little higher than other companies), I decided to go with them because of the ease of communication. He came out as promised and the work got done quickly by him & his team of guys. \n\nI'll definitely use AZ Landscaping Co for my future landscaping/irrigation needs."
0,"This shopping mall stinks!   LITERALLY . . . it stinks!!!    Everywhere you walk, the place reeks of SEWER GAS coming up from the street; especially those irrigated patches where the trees are implanted.   We were out there today and were having to practically RUN from one store to another to escape the stench.   We will definitely not be returning -- especially since there is no unique purpose of selecting to shop here.   They offer nothing more than any other mall in town offers, WITHOUT SEWER GAS!"
0,Its Chilis and you know what you are getting before you walk thru the door.  I like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad.  I had to wait for my soup because they were making more and when I did get it...well it was so watery that I didnt eat it.  My salald was good.  Sat in the bar and the batender was friendly.
1,"Cancun is not very close to the Strip, but it's surprisingly convenient for its far location. Chipotle, Food4Less, and other popular diners/cafes are located within walking distance. \n\nI have roomed here almost every time I visit Vegas. The rooms are extremely well-kept, with earthy furnishings and modern accents... I wouldn't call it anything like home, but why else am I on vacation? I don't want to feel as though I'm home!\n\nI recall the pool was quite roomy; when I used to swim often, I loved that it wasn't a kiddie pool I could swim across in six seconds or so. The slide is definitely appropriate for older children, though. \n\nThe \""adults only\"" gameroom is open to children as long as they look somewhat responsible... I know I don't really pass for 18+ and neither does my friend, yet we always manage to play several rounds of pool. Nobody ever really checks.\n\nDo try snagging the penthouse. It feels, at times, more luxurious than home."

Will not honor their warranty and will tow your vehicle if you try to dispute their work. Their service clerks are RUDE, unprofessional, and misinformed nit wits."
0,"Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.  As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion."
0,"Small rooms w/ small beds, walls are extremely thin, no wonder it's cheap, you really get what you pay for, will never stay here again."
1,"I went to AZ 88 this past week to meet up with some friends and an out of town friend.  It was close to our friends hotel so we thought lets check it out, I hadn't been in awhile.  \n\nThe Good: \nI've been here several times over the last 12 years of living in Phoenix and one thing I have to say is this restaurant is very consistent with their food.  It's always good, and when you order something you know what you are going to get.  A sandwich I had 4-6 years ago, tastes as good today as it did back then. \n \nThe Bad: \nIt's not really bad, but to best honest, I think its time for a little make over.  It's one thing to be consistent but this restaurant needs to catch up with its competition.  There are many many new restaurants in the valley, especially in the Scottsdale area and to the locals this can get boring.  This place hasn't changed in about 10 years, I think its time for a freshen up.  \nOverall, its a great place that brings back many memories from coming here over the years, and I look forward to coming back again."
1,"This place knows subs!!!  We went here at the recommendation of a friend and so glad we made the trek from the strip to give this place a try.  Since we had never been before, we went with 2 of the signature subs.  My friend got the Italian and I got the Roast Beef.  Both were packed with tons of delicious meats and really fresh veggies.  The Italian has a good mix of premium italian meats which were not too salty. \nFor the Roast Beef, I got all of the fixins' to include sweet peppers, onions, italian seasoning and oil & vinegar.  The roast beef was shredded which was a nice touch over your standard sliced meat at other sub shops.  \n\nIn writing this review, I just found out there's one in Encino so I can't wait to try it out when I get back home!  \n\nGood stuff here!"
0,Way to expensive for what you get. Glad I bought a groupon for this place. The food is way to much for what you get. The atmosphere was alright but nothing to write home to mom about.
0,"Prob the most screwed up restaurant in Scottsdale. If you like to dine in dirty, outdated dive bar style restaurants so small you literally eat as one big family with strangers, who by the way consisted of drunk kids from the skatepark next door and large individuals who pretty sure spent most their time in jail. Your in heaven. They even have this bartender who you can read about in other comments who I'm certain is on Breaking Bad's blue meth. Nobody can talk as loud and as much as this guy. It's really quite the show. The little server girls who probably get lashed by bamboo canes from this guy are nice, the food was hot with good portions are the only thing they have going on here. Be prepared if you accept this challenge."
0,"TOP FLOOR ROOMS NOT SAFE DURING HEAVY RAIN!  Rude front desk that doesn't care about guest safety. \n\nWe were staying on the 28th floor.  It was raining and there where some leaks in the hall.  All of the sudden the alarm goes off- we wait for a while- it is still going off.  We head into the hall to see if anyone can tell is what is going on.  We see a panicked woman visiting the US for Austrailia.  She is scared and so we headed down the fire escape.  About the 14th floor we couldn't hear the sirens so we exited the stairwell and we could still hear the alarm.  We didn't know if the elevators were safe.  The fire exit path was not marked as you headed out to the roof over the casino so we had to try several doors at each turn.  We finally get into the hotel and no one knows what we are talking about.  We are told to go to the front desk. \n\nAt the front desk we hailed a manager.  Our Australian women was still shaking so I went and got her a chair from the Casino.  It was right at shift change so the first manager told us it was a false alarm and we would be moved.   She passed us off to Mildred.  She was nice.  We were downgraded rooms in the move so we asked for a manager.  \n\nRyan Ramsey came up.  He offered to comp our night for tonight.  When we asked about the fire escape not being marked he just said \""what do you want me to do?\""  When we asked if it was the same kind of room and he said since we didn't pay for the upgrade we weren't entitled to any else.  We said we were very scared and upset he smirked and told us \""I don't know what you want me to do...\""  \n\nWe asked why no one- even the front desk manager knew about the alarm as they could be checking people into unsafe rooms.  He said they had already stopped checking people into those rooms because of the leaks.   We asked why we had t been called with an offer to move- he said \""we just don't do that\""\n\nWe asked to speak to his manager.  He said there was no one we could talk to.  That there was no one there higher up than him.  If we wanted to complain we had to email the vp of operations.  We questioned that there was no management level between him and her and he said no.  \n\nAt this point now were are furious- he says something like \""I comped you for tonight I don't know what you want me to do\"". He was INCREDIBLY condescending.  He also told us how frustrated he was because he just got here and he got this problem thrown at us.  We tried to ask him if he was frustrated how did he think we felt.  He didn't care.  \n\nWe went upstairs and the bellman was not there because we hadn't gotten back from the front desk.  Honestly at this point we were a little scared and just wanted out of the room.  We called another bellman and shoved everything into bags as fast as we could.  We warned a few guests that the alarm had gone off and there where leaks in our rooms.\n\nI got a call from Raina who said Ryan had said that there was a problem.  I told her my problems and she did apologize. \n\nI have never been treated like this before."
1,"This was our 2nd visit to this True Food location and again we were well taken care of by the staff and servers. We came twice with larger parties of peeps and the staff is more than capable to handle groups.  It does get a bit loud though which was the knock of 1 star.  I don't like having to feel like I'm yelling to my guests who are right across from me. \n\nThe food is excellent. Fresh, temperature appropriate, and delicious. Kids portions are very generous as are the adult portions. It would be easy to share a kid meal with your little one or have them share with you if your little person is a light eater.  We enjoyed the turkey lasagna, red chili shrimp, street tacos, turkey club wrap, salmon, and something else I forget...but it was also very delicious. My son enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake as well and it was delectable. \n\nCan't wait to go back to True Food again soon!"
0,"And empty club (determined by friend that was already there when we showed up), and empty line, and I need to buy bottle service to get in?  No thanks.  This place is awful."
1,"We originally went to Tivoli to get some pizza but as we walked by this place, we said, what the hell, let's try it.\nGood decision.\nIt was 7 on a Saturday night, and honestly, the place was a little empty. Kinda strange I thought, but whatever, we got seated right away.\nGood selection of beers, draft and bottle, tons of wine options, full and half bottles. They have a nice house Double Helix Chardonnay as well as a good, light house Double Helix lager on draft.\n\nThe burger selection was good, plus you can build your own. Would be nice to have more topping choices for the BYO, but they have the basics covered.\n\nI had the sweet bleu bacon burger, nicely cooked, great toasted brioche bun. Fries were server in one of those conical stand with the faux newspaper wrapper, keeps those bad boys hot through the entire meal. And at no time every do I consider a 1/2 pound burger small. It was cooked perfectly and definitely big enough.\n\nWe got a side salad too, and the one annoying thing about that was the plate it was served on was a small rectangle shape and every time you forked a bite, stuff went flying all over the place, a bit annoying. Guys, serve it a larger plate or put it in a bowl!\n\nWhen we left around 8pm and there may have been 4 people in the entire place...the guy at the bar looked like he was about to cry, sorry man, it's gonna be a long night for ya! Too bad, hopefully it picks up for them, I'd go back for sure."
0,"Quality Garage Doors was originally sent us by our home warranty company.  The first trip to our house was good until last week when our garage wouldn't open. After investigating it had not been calibrated. Called company back and they said they would fix it no charge. They advised they would come out this Saturday from 12pm-4pm. My fianc\u00e9 waited and waited. Finally started calling them several times starting around 3pm as we were getting concerned. No one answered, kept getting voice recording although it says they are supposed to be open till 4:30pm. Like you, our time is valuable especially around the holidays. We wasted an afternoon waiting on this company just to be no showed."
1,"One dear friend calls this place \""Whole Paycheck\"" and it does add up quite a bit. Like Kermit says though  \""it's not easy being green\"".\n\nHowever, I do appreciate any business that is willing to be different and to provide a better way of living- give them plenty of kudos simply for that fact. It's not only food, some people don't know WF has a foundation that helps projects that life communities out of poverty, or a Local Producer Loan Program that gives low interest loans to small productions, or support wind and solar power farms to offset 100% of their electrical usage.\n\nFor someone who has food allergies, this place is their savior. For some, it is wholesome foods they can make a change with and I'm rooting for anyone who wants to live consciously.  For people like me though, I come for select things since I can't afford to go fully microbiotic/organic, but I like to keep my home and foods as natural as possible. Going all natural in a world like today, specially in a city like Vegas isn't so easy. It's not like back home where LA has an abundance of big farmers markets and natural food stores to chose from. \n\nFirstly, toothpaste. This is the only place that carries Jason products and their Sea Fresh is the only toothpaste I use. I will not put any other toxic brand in my mouth. Never ever again. I love that they have a variety of natural products and I tend to buy things like shampoo here when I can't get to places like Lush.\n\nI buy mostly from the produce section. It's fresh, it's not too badly priced considering its natural and I find things here I have difficulty finding anywhere else- gold beets, chanterelle mushrooms, brussel sprouts fresh on the stalk, heirloom mini tomatoes,etc.\n\nTheir beer selection isn't wide, but it makes up for in selections. Often times when I am looking for a limited edition, I can find it here. In particular- Dechutes limited like Abyss and Jubel are often available.\n\nDeli is okay. I do love WF deli but this one compared to the Cali ones  and even the other Vegas branches has the most limited selection of the ones I've been in. It's still good quality, just sometimes I'm looking for a particular WF deli item I'm hankering for and this one does not have it. There's this quinoa salad I loved in La Jolla and I've seen it only at the LVB store. I also like their spicy soba noodles, rotisserie chicken and curry salad. \n\nEverything else is hit and miss. Some dry goods, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. I can find cheaper at other natural markets so it's about buying what is a reasonable deal here or getting things here that I cannot find elsewhere (black forest bacon for example). .  Check out the under $3 basket of cheese! I think this is great for a small dinner party since you can sample a load of cheeses that normally come in big $10+ hunks. \n\nAny serious and honest cook can't really denounce a place like this. For the their selection and a honorable mission I am a fan, even when it hurts my wallet."
0,"Pluses... Location, friendly staff that's about it.  Stayed at this hotel because we were attending a swim meet across the street.  Our room was fair at best.  Everything was old. The bed was so hard and lumpy, I had a sore shoulder for 3 days.  Toilet was constantly running and the AC unit sounded like it was 30 years old.  We paid a discounted rate of $139/night...it was worth around $60."
1,This place is hands down the best place to get your phone fixed. I received great customer service and it was a really quick fix !! :) I will definitely recommend this place to everyone. If I could I would give 10 stars. Very satisfied with the work and customer service :)
0,Cheap beer and interesting crowd that go there. It's in Freemont - Downtown.
0,"As a proud black male with an education, let me tell you that I've had better Greek food. I awoke from my midday nap with obvious hunger in my belly, and I was craving something from the land---you know, made with vegetables and animals grazing on hillsides, like the pictures I've seen in books. \nAnyway, I headed down to Pastitsio for a gyro ($8, with a \""salad\""). The gyro perfection was indeed perfect, but the side salad was weak and sloppy wet with a flavorless oil sauce, like my Uncle Red's toupee they found after Katrina hit town.\nThe gyro was definitely flavorful, and not obscenely enormous like some places make them (Rodos Greek Cafe). But the salad was so bad, I knew I need to get home and Yelp to all my homies in the L-Ville. \nService was fine and average, no complaints. And the atmosphere is hip metal tables, exposed brick, and yuppie hipster prices. There was a lovey-dovey couple next to me romantically sharing some rice pudding(also overpriced). \nMy main gripe is that I don't feel I got $8 of gyro and salad--it shoulda been $5. And the menu had too many options. \nI'm a simple man, as you can tell by my picture. Cheap Greek food should be CHEAP.\nNow, back to whoopin some ass..."
1,Went for lunch and the service was great. We got the lunch specials and the food was delicious! Food came out fast. I will definitely go back.
1,"Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order."
1,"Dear Montreal,\n\nThank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout).  Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen.  Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \n\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon."
1,"This is my favorite sushi in the valley, especially when someone else is paying because it's pretty pricy. The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options. I'm not usually a big fan of yellowtail but a friend insisted I try their yellowtail sashimi appetizer. The fiand was so fresh and delicate and the ponzu sauce was so fantastic that I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I tried big eye tuna sashimi for the first time here and was blown away. I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku. We had some standard rolls which were also great but my absolute favorite thing I had was the lobster Roll with soy paper and a misoyaki butter sauce. It was so unbelievably delicious! I've been back several times for that roll alone. The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner."
0,"I've been to D'lish twice now (I wanted to give it a second chance before passing judgement). What I've found is that the food is pretty good but really over priced and they make horrible coffee & chai iced drinks! Both times I visited I ordered the California Club sandwich that has egg, turkey, bacon, pesto, tomato and cream cheese--it's pretty damn D'lish, but $7.95 is A LOT to spend on a breakfast sandwich!! Worth noting also, the first time I went there I asked for regular cream cheese instead of \""lite\"" they said sure...this time, the guy (who was pretty rude the whole time) said they don't have regular ever, only lite...there was no way I could have ordered it like that before!\n\nThe first time I went I ordered a dirty chai 32 oz (large) it was $6!! Yikes! AND, it tasted awful. I noticed when they were making it that they don't actually brew espresso or coffee, they pulled out a gallon of iced coffee from a fridge to make it that looked like something they'd purchased at a store \""iced coffee\""...the drink did not taste fresh and it wasn't in the least bit sweet. I actually had to add sugar when I got to work because it was unpalatable. \n\nToday, I decided to get an iced coffee with mocha. Well...again with the gallon of store bought iced coffee and then what appeared to be a big ol' tub of Hershey's chocolate syrup is what they used to pass this off as a \""mocha\"". Then, when I got the drink it wasn't sweet at all (again) I asked for a little more \""mocha\"" and by the time I got it back it was ridiculously over sweetened. To balance out the sweetness I stopped at Circle K and bought some milk (since, there iced coffee apparently do not come with cream nor do they offer it...I was in the drive thru...). By the time I got to work, put in my milk it was basically a big glass of chocolate milk! \n\nSorry, D'lish...but you're over priced and you couldn't make a good coffee drink if you tried...and you did...twice. I'm out!!"
1,"I love their pizza.  I especially love it when I am there during happy hour and get a discount.  They have a lot of events which I never seem to make it to, but I keep trying.  Service has always been very good although it can take some time when it is busy.   The crust is top notch.  Salads are decent although I usually just get side salads and not the dinner salads which look huge."
0,"This is one of the weakest Sanrio stores I've ever been too. First off, they only carry Hello Kitty character items. There are no other characters to be seen!  If you're going to call yourself a Sanrio store, then at least have some kind of selection.  There was barley even any stationary or stickers for goodness sakes.  Second, they put their own overpriced labels over where you should be able to find the normal prices. Third, there were 2 employees that were gossiping hard core.  Neither of them could be bothered to acknowledge any of the customers in the store.  If your an adult that still keeps a little piece of Sanrio in your heart, don't bother with this place."
0,"allow me to join the chorus of \""what happened to this place?\""s.  my first visit, about 15(!) years ago, was quickly followed by several more because the place was a lot of fun.  in the intervening time, yes, i've changed a bit - but Gameworks has changed more, and not in a good way.\n\nmost of the games here dispense tickets, quickly followed by a raft of mediocre racing simulators that are from a generation or two ago.  a lot of the semi-unique things i might've tried are \""under repair.\""  maybe most disappointingly, there are only four real vintage games - and their CRTs are in bad shape.\n\nGameworks is something i used to look forward to visiting when i was in this area, not so much because i think it's a great place but for the memories.  well, no use now - it's a shell of its former self.  best to leave what good memories remain untainted, stay that way.\n\n(note:  if you're taking little kids, it might be pretty good.  i wouldn't guess 5 stars for that even, though.)"
1,Best sushi in AZ! Great for a group of friends. $20 all you can eat
1,"Surrender is definitely one of my favorite clubs to go to in Vegas. Although, not number one, it holds a top 3 in my book. \n\nLocated in Encore, it's easily enough to find since there are so many signs that will point you in what direction to go to. Get in line early or you'll regret it. Pre-sale tickets for ladies cost $30 a pop, while gentlemen must pay $50 I believe. Even with pre-sales, def go and wait early. Trust. Dress code is the same as it is every where else - dress to impress. \n\nSurrender has a pretty nice design. You can go in and out of the main room they have, which has a lot of small tables and stuff for bottle service, along with a pretty big bar, as well as the outdoor area, near the pool and gambling area. Heads up, there are tiny pathways to get from one side of the pool to the other - just be careful when you're walking around this area because I've seen drunk beezies fall in. The outside area has a lot of tables too for bottle service. Don't fret - there's a couple bars in the outside area too. \n\nSpeaking of bars, drinks are the usual Vegas prices. Depending on who you get, the drinks can be a hit or miss.\n\nOne of the things I love about Surrender is the open layout they have. There's plenty of room to roam around. However, if you go into the main room where the dance floor is and where they moved the DJ stage to, it CAN get packed. I prefer to dance in the area right before you get to the main room. It's outside and definitely has more room to move around. Although, in the winter time, they sort of cover the outside part just outside of the main room up with like a pop up tent and add heaters.\n\nThe music is more house/trance I guess. Not too bad. They do get big names that perform here though. Definitely check ahead to see who's playing. \n\nThe crowd is pretty diverse. You'll get a tons of different people here. It's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a club to party at on your Vegas trip."
0,"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.\n\n\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."
1,I am wayyyyy frugal so I love this place and pretty  much any outlet store-- Its happened on more than one occasion that I found something here discounted that was regular priced at the Galleria or online. Staff is usually friendly -- and although the store is not always at its cleanliessness lol -- i think it goes with the concept .. which I LOVE...
1,"Any time I plan to go to the movies, I try to find a time at Picture Show that works for me.  Even though, it's located at PV Mall, it is far less crowded than the bigger theatres.  Also, because it is at the mall, there are plenty of places in the area to grab a quick bite to eat before or after the movie.  Ticket prices are less expensive.  Concession prices are more reasonable (still up there, but more doable).  I especially like all the room that I get in the actual theater.  The seats are comfy and I don't feel cramped.  Since there is less foot traffic, the staff is always friendly and I often strike up a brief conversation with them before going into the theater.\n\nSo, next time you want to go to the movies, give this one a go.  You will not regret it."
1,"I visited Cesar Chavez Park early in 2011 for a company picnic. We had our picnic on the south side of the park. I walked around the lake and took some photos of the park. As long as the weather is cool, I would recommend this park. If you love the heat, then you can visit the park at  any time of the year.  There is fishing at the lake inside the park. I will upload some photos to give a better idea of what the park has to offer."
1,"I have a lot of clients that attend Las Vegas and this company is who I call on a continue basis in order to take care of all my clients. The CEO and his employees provide high quality service and THE BEST PRICING with bottle service, hotel bookings, show tickets and limo services. I wouldn't go anywhere else, honestly. From my understanding, they do such high volume of bookings, that they companies give them better pricing on especially table service and bachelor / bachelorette parties. \nI noticed he practically has 5 star reviews and that is very accurate. \n\nI even used his service to book a party for New Years, Memorial Day and Labor Day events for the past few years...  And since those are some of the busiest days of they year, HotShot ALWAYS came thru when other promoters in the past denied me or gave me outrageous prices... So If you're looking to book a bachelor party, table service at tryst, surrender, hakkassan, light or even at wet republic / encore beach club pool parties, you're not going to find a better company.\n\nPlus, we had a great host name Joy who took care of all our needs when I personally used them. She personally walked us in, made sure we got the table quickly. No waiting in line.. And a few times, she grabbed some of our friends that came late, that we're stuck outside of the club, with no problem!"
1,"My favorite place to go to de stress ! The owner \""King\"" is a nice guy and really take care of his customers needs. Very reasonable prices and instructors are amazing!"
1,What a lovely experience we had. I'm kind of picky with my taste on wine by that was no challenge for this place. When I wasn't fully satisfied I had a new suggestion and it was perfect!! The lobster was to die for and the crab legs are always and always will be my favorite. They even let me custom my own fav dessert. What's yours? Ask them I'm sure they will assist you! \n\nOh ya.. Be sure to request siting outside when you make your reservation. The lake and light show is a trip! :)
1,"So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."
0,"We sat at the bar for some dinner.  There were only a few people there, yet it took forever to get anything.  The bartender was friendly, but was not happy she had to be.  The food is blah.  I had the potato stuffed with ham, bacon and cheese.  It was a large portion, but the flavor was bland.  My friend eating with me had a similar experience."
1,"Best part about Vegas is the diversity of asian/islander food. \nYou can find plenty of places and I am just getting started. This place use to have a special for 5 bux which is now 6.25. Still worth it, even though that means its 6.75 with tax and 8 dollars with tip. (better tip dammit!)\nAnyway they slam u three long ass pieces of teryaki chicken (i had no idea chikens were so tall!!) when its teryaki day. and its delish. I feed my boo the macaroni salad w siracha and mini pieces of MY chicken mixed in to keep her happy (damn islanders!) but when im alone I always say hold that mayonaise mess (i cant even spell that word its so gross) and slam me 3 scoops of rice. \nTheres 3 0r 4 locations, but after venturing to the one on rainbow I have to say the WS and Eastern spot is the jam of the joint. \nI will go out of my wqay to meetup w people there, if i am anywhere near frys/wholefoods and its tuesday, you best believe Ill be in that parking lot stuffing my fat cheeks and non existant chin with the teriyaki goodness. \n\nAnwway sorry for the lack of reviews lately, I tried to yelp \""clark county correctional kitchen\"" or \""rotten peaches josh insisted on bringing to burning man\"" but nothing came up. That joke was pretty much for me. But if it matters to you, yes, I am laughing."
1,"Capprioti's \""Bobby\"" took steroids, bulked up here at Eddie D's, and now calls himself sir \""Robert.\"" His exterior is tougher, but deep down inside, he's still the soft, cranberry sweet , lovable stuffing we all have known to love. Robert takes gravy baths now so the chicks will love that.  Most girls will dig the 6 in Robert, but for the heftier gals, Robert transforms into 12 in also.  So don't hesitate, when you're lonely for lunch, hit up Eddie D's and find Robert waiting for your company."
0,"The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service."

1,"A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  \n\nLast time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood."
1,"this is my first time trying the crawfish. it was unexpectedly good. My friend from CA came and asked me to take her to crawfish. so i went on yelp and search for crawfish and that why we were there last sunday. The place was actually nice. we order 2lbs and we finished them in half an hour and order another pound. it's really up for it's name, hot and juicy. very good. i would recommend this place to everyone"
0,"Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here."
0,"Horrible customer service!!! I have ordered from here before and I'm actually their only review on another reviewing website that *advises* you =).  At any rate, ordered tonight because I like to support my neighbors (this is locally owned) and I didn't feel like cooking. My order included a $.60 dipping sauce. After the delivery driver left, I realized I didn't get that sauce. I called up there and talked to the manager, Ben.  I explained the situation and said that I didn't want the driver to come all the way back but could they just credit my account for the next time to which he replied \""It's only $.60...\"" and just stopped talking.  My husband overheard this and grabbed the phone and said \""I just spent $40 of my hard earned money at your store and this is how you treat me?\"" then Ben said \""if your going to talk to me that way I will hang up\"". My husband then said \""Now I want the delivery guy to bring it here\"" and the manager hung up on him.  I will most definitely NOT be ordering from here again and I have reposted reviews on the other websites as well. Boo!!"
1,"Took the family here for a morning meal on our vacation. Yelped it first and found the reviews to be spot on. Good solid breakfast food. Great for the kids. The protein pancakes were AMAZING! Loved it! What stood out more than the good food was the sparkling service. The manager/owner and his staff were amazing! I can't say enough about them. This is a good place to patronize, they are doing everything right. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definately coming to US Eggs!"
0,"My friend and I used the recent $25 for $50 Groupon to check out Pewter Rose on a Saturday night. \n\nHonestly, I thought it was a little bit on the pricey side for what it was so I'm glad that we had the coupon. The atmosphere was pleasant but a little kitschy and I kind of felt that plastic tablecloths were inappropriate when you're charging $20+ a plate. \n\nThat said, it was absolutely packed in there. We had reservations for 8pm and arrived right on time and the hostess was able to find us a seat within about 5 minutes. However the first thing out waiter said was essentially \""We're really busy tonight so I hope you're prepared to wait a while for your food\"". We weren't in any rush and agreed that was fine. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses filled but even though we ordered as soon as we were able to, it was after 8:30 before we got our appetizer and 9:20, and honestly that was more waiting than I had expected to do. While the restaurant was full, it is not *that* large. \n\nI had the seafood risotto and it was pretty delicious and I would eat it again. My friend had the herb encrusted lamb and while it was good, we both found it to be overly salty. \n\nI might come back and try the brunch but I don't think I'd pay full price for the dinner."
0,I called to place an order for delivery. When the guy at the store answered the phone I told him I would like to place an order for delivery. He asked if I wanted to place the order over the phone with him or online? Why would I call the store and tell him that I wanted to place an order for delivery if my intent was in any way to place my order online. What a moron!  I'll have nothing thanks!    1:00 PM.

0,"My overall impression was that it was too noisy - not music, just clatter and chatter. The acoustics were terrible. It was so bothersome especially in comparison to the quiet atmosphere at Terra Verde the previous evening, that I listened to my ipod to drown it out.\n\nThe meal was ok.  Sapphire martini was well chilled. Hearts of Romaine were a little wilted. Atlantic salmon was not overcooked. No waiting on a Monday evening at 8:30."
0,"No contest this is the worst apartment i've ever lived in! i have no heat, my drains make a strange and loud gurgling noise whenever my upstairs neighbors or myself flush our toilets. my faucets are constantly leaking even after they've been fixed. the community has dog poop everywhere, i can hear every noise the people above me make. \n\nManagement will try to get extra money from you anyway they can. i tried to drop off my rent check today but they closed early. it wouldve been nice if they had made even the smallest effort to tell their residents what time they would be closing, but no they didnt do that. this way they can get extra money into their greedy hands by being able to charge their residents late fees!! it works out perfect for them. Even if you do pay your rent on time you will still get notices saying that your rent was late. the fact anyone would stay here longer than 1 lease term is beyond me. im counting the days till i can move out!! if you are thinking of renting here PLEASE DON'T! you will be disappointed from the first day."
1,"The food was outstanding, as were the drinks. The decor is simple, but cool. Service was top notch. Worth the price tag!"
1,"Ok, I was so excited to see her show but I was a little disappointed during her performance. \nI've been a fan since I was in middle school. I was expecting a greater and exciting performance. She seemed tired and didn't move too much. Most of her performance was her just moving her arms and walking around. Some songs - she would lip sing and others she sung live. I was expecting a more lively performance like more dancing. I give her a 4 because she is still the queen of pop and I'm still a fan. I liked the venue, it was very intimate so even if you get cheaper tickets, you will still be able to see her close. Would I see her again? Yes, if you are a true fan you will enjoy regardless. But do not expect a over the top performance."
0,"Terrible first experience.  We were so fired up for this place, but dinner was a total letdown.\n\n1) One person's dinner showed up a half hour after everyone else's.

Significantly.\n4) Out of way too many items on the food/drink menu.\n\nPositives: really cute place, great menu with lots of variety.  Some fine-tuning might be able to fix the problems.  Good luck, Rice Paper."
1,"The technician arrived right on time, I showed him the rooms and stairs that I wanted cleaned.  Much to my surprise his price was a couple of dollars less than quoted on the telephone. My concern was that the carpets would not be dry in time for company the next day.  He assured me that they would be dry by evening.  He put up a large fan to help dry as he cleaned. My carpet is white it looks  beautiful and he was right it is almost completely dry. I can't be happier with the job that was done.  Thank you Eco Clean for the very professional technician that you sent out and the Eco Friendly Products that you use. I will definitely use this company again.\n\nDonna S."
0,"This place has really bad service. We waited for over 20 minutes just to get our drink orders taken. Then another 20 minutes to get our food order taken. Then over an hour to get food!! The food is okay--I've had better Indian food in the Valley. The atmosphere is also weird--they have this belly dancer, who has bit too much belly. The owner walks around whistling and putting dollar bills in the belly dancer's top. REALLY bizarre.... So not appropriate for families.  All in all, there's better food, service, and places to go for authentic Indian food.  I've been twice and both times were very disappointing due to poor quality food and service.  There won't be a third time:  I'll never go back again."

1,"We ate here for the first time last night.  Tried the duck fat fries - very good but filled us up!  Sardines were nice, but not as good as the ones at Sardine, in my opinion.  Octopus was cooked perfectly.  Ravioli was like breakfast pasta - perfectly cooked egg and brown butter sauce.  The bacon was delicious and a great complement.  Pork tripe was very good - and with a generous amount of pork belly included.  Despite being full, we had to try the Sicilian Sfingi for dessert, which were like warm gourmet donut holes swimming in chocolate - also delicious.  Spring for the chemex  brewed coffee, you won't be sorry.  They give you enough to share - I couldn't finish it by myself."
1,"Pretty delicious! The melting pot is always one of my favorites. The service is always great (Ashley didn't disappoint during our visit yesterday). The food is consistently delicious. The quality is good but it's up to you to prepare it correctly. My one complaint and the reason I gave 4 vs 5 stars, I was charged $39.95 for the endless fondue but the website and the manager informed me that it'd be $36.95. It's only a $3 difference but, hey, that $3 could have covered my coffee."
0,I have been to Vegas several times over the years and I have visited the Riviera before but this was my first time staying there.  First off they would not honor the room upgrade voucher that they sent me a couple days before.  Once we got to the room there was a huge stain on the carpet  right in front of our door.  Once we settled in we decided to hit the casino floor and we got stuck in the elevator for almost an hour and the fire department had to come and get us out.  It was so hot in there and I had to keep my girlfriend calm because she kept fearing the worst.  Once were were out the woman who worked for the hotel rushed us downstairs and had us wait at a table for about a half hour then came out and apologized for the inconvenience and offered us a couple of free buffets.  She was none too friendly and when I told her that being locked in a sweltering elevator merited more than a couple of free buffets she got even ruder.  The next day I asked to speak with the hotel manager and a woman came out to talk to us and said that she was sorry and gave me another number to call (Lacricia I believe)  I called the number and her receptionist said there was nothing she could do and tried to put if off on the elevator company saying that it was not the hotels fault because they did not own the elevators.  I asked to have the hotel manager call me and I never recieved a call from anyone else.  Our room never seemed to get cool and when I mentioned it to the woman at the front desk she brushed it off.  I didn't realize it until we were checking out but the floor in front of the air conditioning unit was all wet where I had my dirty clothes and some of the colors bled together.  Needless to say it was not a great experience.  I am still shocked at the lack of customer service and the fact that not once person called to follow up with any of my concerns.
1,"In a word WOW! came here after reading the other yelp reviews and all I can say is I am glad I did. I had the salmon special and it was really good the fish was nice and fresh not some frozen patty like the food chains, the potatoes were real and so was the spinach. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I am not a big micro brew guy and when I asked what they had they just point to a giant chalk board in the back. When you have over 20 micro brews on tap a little help would have been nice. I didn't ask for help nor did they offer so you can take that one as you want.\nHow can you beat a killer Salmon dinner and a couple of beers for 26 Bucks?"
1,$3 fish tacos were really nice & I would come back for them. The Asian slaw was delicious & has me craving more as I type. \n\nThe outdoor seating is lovely with overhead string bulb lights & a fountain which would make for a romantic setting in the evenings. I did notice the service was quite slow so make sure you're not in a rush.\n\nIt's a bit expensive for a meal but you're getting nice quality fish and goodies. They have a small beer & wine selection in addition to sodas.
1,"I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't think they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live.\n\nI also like supporting local Arizona business.\n\nThe staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff. \n\nThey often run a $10 dinner \""combo\"" package that is a really fair deal if you don't feel like cooking. You get to pick from different items and piece together a meal for $10. Not bad to feed a family of 4."
0,"This is the only place that you have to request to have the whole car cleaned.  According to Ignacio Cluff, General Operations Manager they don't do the whole car including the trunk. This is from Ignacio, \""We are happy to vacuum the trunk but unfortunately we only do it at the customers request. Many customers do not want us in their trunk.\""  I think the guy is a liar and if not you should know you should go to any number of places and they clean ALL of the car.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
0,"Me and my husband went in today for sushi , the food was good , except they take FOREVER to get the food but it's a okay sushi restaurant  . The young lady working had HORRIBLE customer service , walked in and ignored us completely , after she sat us down she did not take our beverage order . So then she came back and asked us , after we ordered food she kept bringing our plates and just throwing them at our table ! There was to a point we were going to leave Because awful service !! I do not know why they would have a person with such rude service , makes the restaurant look bad ! Although we asked the old lady to help us out and she was very friendly and made up for the rudeness of the young lady . She was very helpful . I know I will not be coming to this restaurant  again , they need to teach these people how to be NICE at least not fucken\n RUDE !!!"
0,"My husband and I had both of our families in town for a small wedding in February. We had our first date at MezzaNotte and have been regular customers since. We decided to have a little dinner reception at the restaurant after our ceremony. It was a large party of 18 people. We had quite a bit of trouble getting a menu established with the managers. They don't seem to communicate very well and are largely unorganized. On The night of our reception most everything went alright, but we were disappointed that the managers didn't honor our menu requests. We paid a lot of money to have our families eat at the restaurant and while the main dishes were good, our agreed upon appetizers and desserts were not. We were highly disappointed and will probably be looking for a new neighborhood italian restaurant."
1,"I fixed my friends' computer so he agreed to take me to lunch. Of course, I had been meaning to check out Chuckbox a while ago because all of my friends go every Friday for lunch. In fact, for some of them Chuckbox is so special that it can only be had on Fridays for lunch. As such, I was kind of excited to see what the hype was about.\n\nOrdering your food is really simple, their menu is really basic and its easy to figure out what you want to eat. Even though I don't care much for the white or wheat dilemma, I still thought it was cool that they offered such a choice. But I like to be old fashioned, \""Big one\"" + fries and a cup of water. You can smell Chuckbox from a mile away sometimes because they are grilling ridiculous amounts of meat. The aroma is extraordinary, and you would probably forget that you're in the scorching AZ sun. \n\nOnce you actually get your burger you pay, cash only, and take your sandwich to the condiments bar. They have pretty much all the basics you'd want in your burger. They even have extra lettuce and ranch, which equates to a free salad. Are you winning yet?\n\nOverall, the burgers were extremely flavorful, and it was plenty of food for the money. The only downside is that beef patties were frozen and that takes away from some of the flavor. Its not that I have anything personal against frozen beef, it just doesn't have the same juicyness as something that's not frozen. For this same reason, I think it loses a star. Other than that, its a perfect burger joint."
0,"WATCH OUT FOR THE TIP AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED BY THE SERVER IF YOU ARE THERE FOR THE GROUP GATHERING!\n\nI have been to this place twice (Happy Hour and Dinner) and the food and wine are generally decent. I can't complain much about the ambient, cheese, food, and wine, but when it comes to the time to pay, some server charges excessive amount of service tip on your bill. You need to watch out for this and need to sober up!\n\nOne of the servers told me that the tip amount for the group gathering (6 people or more) is 18% out of the total before Tax, but when I received the bill the gratuity was 23% AFTER THE TAX amount. (I realized this when I saw the bill next day). So I over paid the tip although I thought the service was OK. (I asked for a glass of ice water several times, but the server was keep forgetting my requests).\n\nAgain, if you are planning some group event here, please watch out for the tip unless you believe the service is superb...."
0,"Since we live close, we were anxiously waiting for something to open back up in the old Smokehouse BBQ place after 15 North closed.\n\nMaverick Rock Taco was a disappointment.  It is very pricey for what you get and just not that good.  Basically they have several options for fillings and you can get them in a taco ($3), burrito ($9), salad or entree (varies but in the teens)\n\nWe started with chips and salsa with a trio of sauces ($9).  The salsas were completely lacking in spice, including the mango habernero.  The tomatillo wasn't bad tasting but just a little bland.  The chips were interesting--more flour tortillas than corn with sea salt.  Not too bad but for $9?\n\nThe tacos were pricey, small and not that good.  The shrimp tacos were very good but all the others we sampled were dry overcooked and bland.\n\nThe burritos were the same as the tacos only filled with rice to take up the space in the larger tortilla--definitely not the way to go.\n\nThe margaritas were good ($10).  The service was not bad at all--as far as the regular service.  It took a very long time to get drinks, though and the bar was not that full when we were there.\n\nThe place was very loud and it was tough to carry on a conversation.  It would probably be a good place for kids as they could run around screaming and nobody would notice over the sound system.\n\nBasically, I can make everything on their menu better and cheaper and if I am short on time, I will stick with Roasting Company's soft tacos or even the Taco Bell down the street in the future."
1,Had lunch last week at the town square location.  Bartenders were wonderful and made fresh drinks every time.  We ordered 6 different meals off the happy hour menu.  Everything was great especially for the hh price
0,"So I previously did a review on the tramonto good egg, and I must say im super bummed I dont feel like I can brag about this location anymore. I loved coming here with my two little ones for the upbeat environment. I dont know if the management has change or what, I do see a few new faces . The food is still good but good with a not so good vibe is just another buisness to me that wants my money and I can put my money where its really wanted and earned. After all this is a customer service industry and a customer should feel that way. Hope things change so il want to come back. :/"
0,"It was a late night and almost everything else was closed. I was VERY happy that I had an option for dinner. There were three or four other tables filled at the time so we figured that it couldn't be that bad. I was hungry and quick to order:\n\nBread and Butter\nFrench Onion Soup\nBoneless Buffalo Wings\n16oz Prime Rib (medium) with baked sweet potato and Mac'n cheese\n\nI was happy to have the bread arrive so soon after our order due to how hungry I was; it helped that it was actually rather tasty. I was hoping that the bread would be a foreshadowing of the rest of the meal when the french onion soup arrived. I was a tad let down by the size of the soup. I was really let down when I tried to the soup; it was just not something I wanted to order again. \n\nAs I was picking through the soup, my boneless buffalo wings arrived. I immediately switched gears and dug into the wings. I don't understand what they did in the kitchen, but the wings tasted more like liquid smoke than buffalo. My thoughts of a great late-night dinner were quickly dissipating. At this point, I was hoping that the entree would should show me something that was better than what I had tried.\n\nWhen the entree arrived I was surprised yet again by the fact that my mac'n cheese was missing. My server assured me that it would be coming so dug into the meat and sweet potato. I was still rather hungry since I hadn't eaten much of the soup or the wings. The meat was a tad overcooked while the sweet potato was undercooked. I moved the potato to the side and focused on the meat. While I never did receive the mac'n cheese, I don't know that I would have eaten considering the quality of the rest of the food.\n\nAfter seeing the bill, I can guarantee that I won't return to this particular steakhouse."
1,Staying at the Mandalay Bay it was pretty much a given that I would come here. I love animals and I am fascinated with the ocean. I really enjoyed my experience here. They had a beautiful display of jelly fish that were green and red to resemble Christmas colors. They had a lot of sharks as well and it is just so cool to watch them swim. They had many tanks with all kinds of different fish. The also had a pool with sting rays in it and they let you pet them which was pretty awesome. I really think you should come see for yourself. The tickets are $18 which isnt bad. The only drawbacks is when it gets crowded which it was it is hard to see and take pictures. The spaces to look are on the small side so when it is crowded it kind of messes it up a little. The other thing is that is short. Monterrey Aquarium for example is much larger. You will get through this one pretty quick. Other than that it was enjoyable and educational. They have a giftshop at the end that has some pretty cool souveniors.
1,"While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.\n\nThis is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. \n\nThe food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.\n\nbottom line: everything was good and service was great!\n\nThe atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings."
0,"Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food."
1,"Best place to eat, drink and hang with friends on the isthmus.  Period."
1,"What a beautiful, unique, delicious new restaurant. Sampled a little bit of everything!!  Mushroom tacos, dried fruit guac, yellowtail ceviche, summer corn, and chicken mole...all of which were phenomenal. The plating is especially beautiful, with each dish looking like a work of art. Also pleasantly surprising were the prices, which at this level of quality, combined with the location, I would have expected to be far higher. \nService was equally excellent, as is the ambience. I hope this place is very successful!!"
1,We first came here to the emergency room for my wife.  Today she had an outpatient surgical procedure.  We are very pleased with this hospital.  The staff is excellent and caring.  We are glad to have such a good facility close to home
1,"Came in for lunch and the place was pretty empty. I believe perhaps they were just opening. I ordered a BFM (Best Friday's Margarita) and the bartender made it with some love. I appreciated that. :-) For lunch I ordered the California Club with sweet potato fries. The food was very fresh. I assumed it was a hot sandwich but instead its a cold one. Not a deal breaker though. I really enjoyed it. It was cool too see the CIAA additions to the restaurant as I am solely in town for this event. Overall, the service was good and the food was good too.."
1,"I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit."
0,"Went here with a group of six people, with reservations for a Saturday night.  We were seated right away, but there was clearly no need for reservations as there were several empty tables.  The table next to us was having their food cooked, and nobody seemed to be excited or enjoying it.  It soon became clear why this was the case.\n  \nOur waitress came to the table once, after we sat there for about 20 minutes.  She took our order, then brought a salad for each of us after another 10 minutes.  We never saw her again until the end of the meal, when we had to ask someone for our checks.  The chef came to start cooking, and we had to ask for our soup, which had of course not been brought out by the waitress.  One couple had ordered a sushi roll, which also had not been delivered so they cancelled that.\n\nThe food was not particularly good.  The filets were all cooked to medium well, no matter how they were ordered.  On the other hand, the shrimp did not seem to be cooked all the way.  There were even items missing like a chicken breast, so the chef had to cook those at the very end. \n\nSince our waitress had not come back, we had to ask another person to refill the waters.  This person was cleaning tables and had his hand in a bucket of what was presumably bleach water.  He put that down, went to the back and started scooping ice into the pitcher without having time to wash his hands.  We did not drink the water after it was delivered.  \n\nWhen we were leaving, we told the owner about our problems with the meal and the terrible service.  She offered us $10 off for our next visit (total for six people who just spent $150) and told us not to tell anyone about the problems we experienced.  Don't worry, I won't tell.  ;-)"
1,Delicious food and drink.  Great atmosphere.  Love it.
0,"I went to the bar last night (sat) and it took FOREVER to get my drink. I order a Long Island, when I got it the drink was CLEAR! I told the bartender \""Ashely\"" that my drink wasn't right and she had the nerve to take a drink out of my drink and told me \""it taste fine and I not making you a new one\""! WTF don't ever go here!"
0,"I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under-cooked food was enough to cure me for life - I won't go back."
0,"Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future."
0,"Of all the Kohl's stores I've been in, this is the worst.  I found the customer service to be very bad and the clothing racks were all disorganized.  I don't mind spending some time in a store searching for a deal in 70 or 80% off racks, but when these racks are COMPLETE CHAOS it is very frustrating.  Yes, customers are not being courteous when they leave the wrong size in the wrong area, but customer service representatives should be checking for these things.  They do at other Kohl's locations."
1,"We have this family tradition that started when I was 17...\nI celebrate my birthday 6 months in advance.\n\nSo I came here at 20.5 years old to celebrate my 21st birthday with family, and had the best service I have ever had in Vegas at any other hotel. (I've been to 7 different ones.)\n\nGranted, I wouldn't say they are the best, but one of the guys there (I cant remember his name for the life of me) was so attentive and always had a smile on. :)\n\nOne of the best starters to my birthday celebration ever!"
0,"NEARLY RUINED MY TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DANGEROUS AIRPLANES \n\nHow anyone could possibly rate this airlines above one star is an absolute falsification of information. This is the worst experience I've ever had traveling. 2 hour delay going, 1.5 hour delaying coming. Combine that with bag charges of $150. \n\nOriginally my ticket from Oakland to Las Vegas was $149 roughly $20 cheaper then southwest. Bag charges brought my ticket to just below 300. The delays caused me to have to pay for an extra day of parking as well."
1,I usually get the Pad Thai and spring rolls. The soups are fantastic and quite authentic but are huge portions. Not the prettiest setting but definitely some of the more authentic Thai food in the Phoenix area.
0,"I have glanced over the other reviews and generally speaking I can attest to and agree with the other 1/2 star ratings.  With that being said, I will only speak to my own unique personal experiences with this apartment since the other reviews covered some of my complaints adequately (shutting the water off for hours at a time on a weekly basis with no warning, checking the fire alarms at least on a monthly basis, low quality appliances, etc.). This review may be a tad on the long side but believe me, if you are considering moving here, it is all stuff that would be beneficial to know.\n\nFirst things first, this complex is woefully under-managed. The property manager and front office staff are the most incompetent, unprofessional people I have met in all my years of dealing with rental property. They are rude and will talk junk directly to your face (the customer is not always right at Roosevelt). If they aren't out back smoking cigarettes in the parking garage, they're busy sending out emails riddled with grammatical errors. At one point, I even had a staff member of the complex admit that they get DAILY complaints about how terrible the property manager is. \n\nI moved to this apartment from out of state, therefore I had all the paperwork done through email and fax in order to facilitate a move in date that matched up with the date I arrived in Phoenix. I was told multiple times that everything was in line and I was good to go. I get on the cross country flight to Phoenix with my dog and suitcase and take a taxi to the apartment. Once there, I was told that the paperwork would not go through and essentially \""sorry about it, not our problem.\"" This left me homeless in a new city with which I had no clue about. I had to rent a hotel room and a rental car for a WEEK, before the management fixed whatever issue they were having with the paperwork. I knew from that point on it was going to be a horrible experience but believe me, I called around and all the other apartments in the same area were booked. \n\nNext thing is: THIS IS NOT A GATED COMMUNITY. Sure, there's a gate in theory, but the key fob access only worked about 25% of the time that I lived there. It must truly be the most difficult, complicated thing to keep running properly because the doors broke on a weekly basis. At one point the gates weren't working for around 8 months straight and I guess the word got out to the homeless community. Other tenants and I found multiple homeless people wandering the halls checking doorknobs as well as homeless people sleeping in the corridors. There was also gang graffiti that began to appear in the hallways. Don't get me wrong, this is a safe community IMO, but that doesn't take away from the fact that there is a lot of vagrants that do walk through this area. The gates are needed to ensure safety. \n\nMy last and final complaint is that there were multiple instances of the front office staff stealing and/or withholding my packages. I would get an alert from the office or a slip from Fedex that said there's a package in the front office. When I would go to pick it up the office workers would look for a brief minute and claim sorry it's not here. (Very helpful I know). They would say its not their problem, despite ya know legally it is their responsibility since they sign for all the packages. I eventually filed a mail fraud claim with the local postal office and the issue of missing packages ended shortly thereafter. \n\nOverall, this community has a great location and some friendly tenants. But for $1,000 a month the quality of the apartments is way below value and the management is simply not worth dealing with. Heed this review and the others. This apartment doesn't have a 2 star rating for no reason."
1,"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!"
1,Never really read books but went to get magazine before.
1,"I was a regular here when it was 'Massa' - the 50p drinks and crackin tunes were my perfect night out. I was a bit hesitant when it changed hands to Electric Circus, and a bit more hesitant when I heard it would was a karaoke bar. \n\nThere were a few things that first struck me when I went into Electric Circus - the cool, bright colours, the mirrors and the fact that the vodka they served wasn't paint-stripper anymore! Yey! All the little rooms were really cute and the perfect size for a group of friends, taking turns to belt out the tunes. I must admit I was in my element - microphone in hand, all my friends around me, the bar behind me...what's not to like!!\n\nThey have still managed to keep the buzzing atmosphere in the main part of the club. I hate to say it....but I think I like it even better than when it was Massa!"
1,"In short, the Dilly is a drinker's bar.  Cheap drinks, tons of regulars, and dark enough to make it easy to forget the world outside.  Hipsters beware, this isn't the Little Woody, it isn't the Vig...hell, it's not even Hazelwood's, but it is a great place to unwind.\n\n- pool table, check\n- darts, check\n- TVs, check\n- jukebox, check\n- strange edibles served out of a liquid-filled jar, check\n- seasoned, female bartender that doesn't take shit from anyone, check\n- fellow customer offering to give you a tattoo right there, for free, check"

0,"I would not even give one star but i did receive one good hair cut. Been here 3 times 1st time was a good hair cut by Curtis but the atmosphere is ghetto play loud music to the point you have to scream at each other. The next time got another hair cut from Curtis this time guys walking in with pit bulls guys yelling at each other again because music is to loud. The hair cut wasn't as good he was distracted by all the stuff going on. The 3rd time went in asked for hair cut since Curtis was off they referred me to Bobby waited 2:30 hours for 3 guys to get haircut since the other 2 barbers decided to stop cutting hair for the day at 3pm. I waited patiently till my turn was up next which now is almost 5:30 pm a guy walks in off the street ask for a touch up. Which Bobby must have known and tells me I have to wait while he touches up his hair so he can go out later. I walked out and the other person who was behind me also walked out. The customer service sucks the atmosphere is a run down hole in the wall. The walls are white which look Grey I know they are white from a poster removed that is the only white spot on the wall. Ceiling fan, broke holes in the wall. The bathroom is a shit hole never been cleaned you are better off holding it. The prices say $14 for haircut but when I asked how much I owed he told me $20. I got a good hair cut once so try to give benefit of doubt and went back but will never be back with the last bull shit they pulled."
0,"BEWARE THE GRAVEYARD MENU.  Typically I have a great meal and time at shucks. living close by I have been there quite a few times. Last night a buddy and I shared some fried clam strips and peel and eat shrimp. When the clams arrived the first thing I thought was \""what the hell is this?\"" I have never seen clams that were almost 5 inches long. Was very unsettling, but I thought to myself, \""who am I? I don't know if maybe these are different from every other clam I've eaten, so what the heck\"" tasted OK, were very chewy, I still wasn't convinced these were actual clams, but kept eating.  About 5 hours later I woke up with stomach cramps, proceeded to vomit all of the food I had eaten, and dry heaved for another hour or so while I began to become feverish. I lost a day of work and needless to say they have lost a customer.\n\nThe plus side of the story is that my buddy did not get sick, I checked with him but apparently he did some heavy drinking afterwards so not sure if that affected his toxicity levels."
0,"Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."
0,"Tooling around Vegas late at night one is left with the conundrum...do I want to spend $40/50/person+ and expect great food (being disappointed with anything less), or do I spend less and take a major roll of the dice that my dinner might be better fit for a dog?\n\nDeciding that at least if a buffet isn't that great, you can still really fill up, we found ourselves on line for a couple minutes before entering this buffet at the Flamingo.  Selection was decent, but hardly huge, and even the dessert area, while taking up a lot of space, didn't really have that much variety to offer.  Do we really need 25 feet of \""sugar-free desserts\""?\n\nThe drink service was annoying to say the least, as the soda hardly tasted right, and the servers rarely paid you any attention.  Why no open area to get your own drinks?\n\nThe food itself ranged from marginal at best (lobster bisque, pasta) to forgettable but decent (poultry dishes, other seafood) to fairly good (green beans, fried rice, beef dishes).  The desserts were hit and miss as well.\n\nIn the end, for $25 a person, this was right on the edge of tolerable.  One could fill up on pretty decent food, and that was the saving grace.  However, I'm sure it far from the best buffet or best deal available on the strip.  It was essentially the hand we were dealt, and at least we didn't lose our shirts."
1,"There is a place in Arizona where the convenience of fast food meets the benefits of a fresh, quasi vegetarian menu in a salubrious confluence of amazing food and drinks. This place is D'Lish. Didn't see that coming, did you?\n\nWhile this place is great any day of the week, I usually like to include it in my weekend routine. What is that routine you ask, well I'll tell you. I wake up before sunrise and hike a mountain shaped like a camel. At the top, I fight a dragon who has swallowed a magical key that will unlock a room at the top of a tower that contains a riddling troll who will eat you if you cannot answer his three mind puzzles. After wrenching the key from the bowels of the flying beast, I realize I'm hungry, so I stop at D'Lish for an early morning meal, which delivers every time to satiate my heroic appetite.\n\nThe AZ Burro, the Protein Burgers (House style and early bird) are my personal favorites, but I have yet to eat something there I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I even like the frittatas, which I previously thought to be punishment disguised as food.\n\nAnd then there're the drinks, which seem to have already been covered thoroughly by my fellow yelpers, so I'll just say this: I can see The \""Dwayne Johnson\"" Rock drinking/eating a breakfast buzz. Or at least that's how I like to picture myself when I consume one.\n\nHaving devoured my breakfast burrito and protein peanut butter coffee drink, I continue my weekend quest to the tower with the troll, fueled by the life-giving offerings of D'Lish Kitchen and Coffee House."
1,Dr. Berschler is the best!  Signed up for a dental plan (HM0) but found out Dr. Berschler was not on the plan and was very disappointed. Went to a dentist on the plan but had a lot of problems with the office and now I'm back! I can't say enough about Downtown Phoenix Dental.  Everyone is top knotch and I'm sorry I even considered a change. I'm recommending this office to all my friends.
0,"Not a huge fan of this Ross. If I'm in the area, I'll check it out but they aren't particularly well-stocked and their aisles are a bit on the messy side. \n\nFrom time to time I'll find a good buy, but for the most part I leave empty-handed. This is a rarity for me when I visit Ross. Definitely not one of the better options in town, but worth a stop from time to time."
0,"Are you kidding me?! Worst experience of my life! Skin Design Tattoo is one of the worst tattoo shops I have ever been to in my life! Mind you, this isn't just your second rate 'star design' type of tattoo collector; I have travelled the globe and have had thousands of dollars of work done, so I have a little but of knowledge when it comes to a good tattoo shop...and this, people, is not one of those shops! On top of putting down a deposit in order to schedule an appointment, I show up and was 'ordered' to wait over an hour for the artist, whom I will not name, to be done with his previous client. Am I confused at what the purpose of an appointment is? I mean, it's to schedule a certain time with your artist, correct? Needless to say, all of the artist's cohorts made it possible for him not to fulfill his obligations, so I left. Don't worry, every time I'm stopped on the streets by people who ask about my existing tattoos, I'll let them know that none of them were done here, and why... you're welcome. I mean, consider literacy when you're evaluating reviews, people. You can tell by reading the rest of these reviews what kind of customers this place caters to. If it isn't obvious, uhm, the unfortunate, illiterate, willing-to-pay-anything type of people; sadly due to the fact that their self-esteems only allow for sub-par customer service, and art."
1,"This is our new go to, and considering we live in Surprise, that says a lot :) The groupons make the drive worth it, we break even and get an awesome movie experience.  The seats are comfy, the theater is less crowded, the popcorn is good (not as good as AMC or Harkins, but good) waiters and waitresses are always wonferful.  \n\nI have even hosted a birthday party with 8 kids, using groupons, and have a perfect, hick-up free event."
1,"First time trying snow and it did not disappoint!\n\nCoconut delight (4 stars): If you love coconut and pineapple you must get this! Very refreshing. The pineapple chunks were sweet and the coconut shavings were great with it. Just couldn't taste much coconut flavor in the snow but the shavings made up for that. \n\nTaro: I don't like taro but I tried it anyway. Didn't taste too much like taro to me though.\n\nGreen tea: I don't like green tea flavored desserts either, this definitely tasted like green tea so if you like that you should get this. \n\nThe small size is pretty big! So share if you want. They have recommended combos or you can make your own. Their combos look really good though so I'd stick with that. \n\nService (5 stars):\nThe ladies working were really nice. \n\nAtmosphere:\nSmall place, but clean. Got busier the later it was."
1,"I had the quiche which they had to warm up (microwave) so parts were hot, parts were cold. I probably should've gotten there earlier for this but what can you do. That is the only reason this place does not get five stars. \n\nOn to the good stuff: the eclair was one of the best I've ever tasted. Fluffy, light, savory: everything you want out of an eclair was there. Still think about it to this day. My girlfriend got a prosciutto and pickle sandwich on a French baguette which soon became her favorite sandwich. \n\nThe bear claw- like item was also delicious. It's an awesome little locally owned bakery. I don't know why you would go anywhere else. It is quintessential lawerenceville and that's awesome."
0,"I'll keep this simple - we ordered 2 sampler plates, and all the meats were very dry (brisket, chicken, ribs, and pulled pork).  I could say we were bbq aficionados from Austin to try and make this review more relevant, but when the meat is this dry - it doesn't take a bbq snob to know this place stinks.\n\nI did think the sides were okay (mac and cheese, cheesy potatoes, apple crisp), but we came for bbq."
0,"Vast amounts of poorly prepared food presented in a raucous atmosphere of dragooned waiter/waitress choruses of the \""special\"" restaurant birthday song.\n\nIf you don't have a screaming infant you need to bring to a restaurant, don't go.  \n\nThe Veal Parmesan was a howling mess.  It's an \""Italian\"" restaurant, and they don't even serve capellini."
0,Ribs are good. But this place is waaaaaay overpriced. Go to Rolling Smoke it's better and cheaper
1,"My wife and I have gone to this place countless times along with our daughter. My wife always gets a full pedi with flower etc. pricing is average but all of the staff are good. I don't always want to get a full pedi, so I just get a callous removal which is $10.00. I don't need all the extras and there seems to be nowhere else in chandler that does this for $10.00. We will continue to go back!!"
0,"So we got duped by all the rave reviews for this restaurant. First we get escorted to a tiny little table that was practically like sitting with the people at the next table. We asked to sit at the many empty tables for four. Were told no as they all had reservations. The waiter must have noticed the perplexed expression on my face because he came back after we sat and told us that a reservation had cancelled and offered us one of those tables...So points for that...Side note, all those tables were empty for the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered the Chicken with prosciutto...I promise you that what I got was chicken with some sort of thick slab of very salty pork product that was not prosciutto, accompanied by the limpest over done pasta I've ever had..The noodles broke in the fork because they were so water logged and soggy. Also served with a basic marinara sauce that in no way complimented the lemon wine sauce on the chicken. My husband ordered the special..seafood risotto. Plenty of seafood, but we're still trying to decide if it was really risotto or some undercooked rice..There was none of the creaminess associated with well prepared risotto.\n\nAfter that we decided to go for broke and order the tiramisu..You can get better at your basic supermarket bakery.\n\nThe service was very good as the waiter and busser were very attentive.."
0,"I had fond memories of the Ella's Deli on State Street - and the fried pound cake in particular - and figured it would be a good second choice for brunch with my daughter when we found Monty's Blue Plate Diner was too busy on our visit to Madison.  What a mistake!  The restaurant itself is a kitschy tourist trap, with grime-covered mechanical toys littering the entire restaurant.  Entertaining for some perhaps, I found it extremely depressing.  The wait for our food seemed interminable, and when it did arrive, my omelet was cold, flat, and hardened.  I practically wanted to cry, realizing we had missed an opportunity for a wonderful breakfast at Monty's - much less, that we had shelled out as much as we had for a disgusting breakfast at Ella's.  I will not ever come back if I can help it."
1,"Since being pregnant I've had a craving for none other than pizza. Pizza in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. Every meal. Pizza. Needless to say, I did drive from Henderson to Summerlin to FINALLY try Dom DeMarco's.\n\nBeautiful restaurant in a great Summerlin location. Excellent service. \n\nDom DeMarco's actually has the recipe to DiFara's pizza, consistently rated best of Brooklyn, and it was such a treat to have a Brooklyn favorite right here in Vegas. The sicilian pie has the thickest, flakiest most delicious crust. You just don't find a square pie like that ANYWHERE else in town. \n\nHeard a rumor that they may be pulling the trigger on a Green Valley location! Please do! I've been craving their square pizza pie a while now but going to Summerlin for pizza seems almost as inconvenient as going to Brooklyn."
0,"I am a real customer here and yelp removed my previous review saying that it \""lacks a firsthand customer experience at this location\""... can you believe that??! How the hell can yelp tell me that this was not a first hand experience?!\n\nA repeat of my review about my FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE here at Giadas:\nI'm basing this review solely on the grossly overpriced menu. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants and steakhouses in the US and none of them come close to the outrageous prices charged at Giadas. I'm all for paying good money for a meal, but $75 for a bone in ribeye or $35+ for a plate of pasta portioned the size of an appetizer (just look at some of the pictures) is just absurd.\n\nSure, it's a good steak.... that's right.. I ATE IT!! But it's not even close to justifying its price. I'm pretty much disappointed with almost all the food network star restaurants and Giadas has managed to make it to the top of the list. All these guys cross promote each other to fuel their own pockets. Way to ride the fame bandwagon and lure people in with your TV name. Shame on you. \n\nMore detail about MY FIRST HAND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They have a seating area overlooking the strip. The kitchen is right out in the open for a \""showy\"" atmosphere. The Hostesses where grey heels with short white friffy dresses that have holes in them. There was a 30 minute wait last Saturday afternoon and we didn't even have to make a reservation to get a seat. We had a $14 arugula salad, I ate a bone in Ribeye with a egg on-top of it sprinkled with arugula and my friend had the lemon pasta which came with two prawns and looked like an appetizer. Side of lemon potatoes and the Tiramisu which came in a tiny shot glass and an espresso to finish off our underwhelming meal. I drank coke, she had a fancy drink.. the total came out right under $200. Everything tasted good... not amazing... will I write about how I felt about each and every item?? No... because explanation can justify being reamed not only in price.. but portions as well. I've paid good money for great food.. but I've never seen outrageous prices unless it was a special day like V-Day... in which case I guess we can justify paying $100+ a person... for a filling meal at least.\n\nWe went to Gordon Ramsays Steak the night after and had a wonderful and FILLING meal for two for less than$140. Portions were larger and we even had leftovers... Something I couldn't imagine happens a lot here at Giadas.\n\nGIADAS IS A PAID YELP ADVERTISER. They made a complaint to remove my legitimate negative review about a REAL experience here at Giadas. How can you say I didn't eat here when I know what their food tastes like and that they serve measily portions for top shelf prices. We left hungry and spent a couple hundred for a meal for two."
1,"Stopped in for some brisket.  Had the dinner plate.  As usual, cut it with a plastic fork tender.  Just yummy.  I went with double mac and cheese as my 2 sides.  Theirs is a little different.  Has some onion and I suspect other spices in it and I love it.  And as I always do, I must mention the sauce.  Again, a little different than the usual here.  Love it again.\n\nAlso as usual, friendly and prompt service too.  Thanks again Bobbee."
0,"bad service, overpriced (by Vegas standards).  I left in the middle of the pedicure.  'nuff said."
0,"I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered. \n\nA friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W. \n\nThe downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever. \n\nAlas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much. \n\nI tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us. \n\nI should've stepped in and said \""look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack.\"" \n\nIn the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways. \n\nIt's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event. \n\nI never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way. \n\nPretentiousness is next to ugliness. \n\nIf I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do. \n\nSo I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain. \n\nBlow me, W... you $#&@"
1,"Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!"
1,"One word:  Awesome!!\nIf you've never ate  a burger at the Chuck Box, then you haven't really had the best burger ever made, period....\n\nIts a must for me to eat here once more before I leave  Az."
0,"So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  \nOn with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. \nI would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."
1,"Saw the sign out front for like three months (seemed like it) before they opened and finally tonight we got a chance to try them out.  \n\nIf you've not had Vietnamese food before, think fresh elements like basil leaves to pinch off the stalk, plump bean sprouts and stuff like that.  neat approach to adding as much, or as little spice and flavor as you want.\n\nThe decor was OK - imported wood benches, chairs and tables with a glass top easy to wipe down quickly.   The wait staff promptly greeted us and we were shown to table #8.  Our waitress, Jennifer retrieved our drinks, water with a little lime slice in it. \n\nThe menu was presented and it was an adventure too.  The inside front was in Vietnamese and it was translated in English on the inside back - no big whup, I know, but kinda fun.\n\nWe had Vietnamese food before, visiting anther restaurant with our friends, one of whom grew up in Cambodia but not being a regular, we were just a bit unsure - not only of what to select, but how to pronounce the dishes we saw in the menu - the waitress, Jennifer, was very patient and coached us through the effort.\n\nWe ended up with an appetizer and two different entree, knowing that it was way more food than we wanted, but we did want to try new dishes and get a sense of the kitchen.\n\nThe first dish to arrive was Pho Ga, basically a chicken soup with long noodles.  It's served with fresh bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno slices and a lime wedge.  Once it arrives at your table, you're supposed to add the fresh ingredients and then dive in - the fresh with the broth, chicken and noodles is a great meal.  We added Hoisin Sauce and it added just a touch of sweet.\n\nThe next dish was Bun Bo Dac Biet, a spicy pork noodle soup.  The noodles are a bit larger and the fresh elements included the basil, bean sprouts and banana flowers, or at least part of a banana flower.  I added a bit more chili paste to really drive up the heat factor, but hey, that's how I roll ya know.\n\nThe final dish served was our appetizer, Banh Xeo.  This was a referred to as a Vietnamese pancake, but a savory egg pancake with shrimp, bean sprouts and supposed to be ripped apart and served on a lettuce leaf with a sweet & spicy sauce.  The ripping apart was facilitated when they handed us a pair of kitchen shears and we cut the Bahn Xeo into pieces and assembled them on a lettuce leaf and spooned the spicy sauce.  Really yum...\n\nThe place was not anywhere near full when we arrived, but traffic was steady for takeout and several more people came in for dining.\n\nWe got to meet Nancy, the other waitress and Jennie, the owner and manager.  jennie was really happy to hear how much we enjoyed our meal.  When we told her I had tweeted it out to 1,700 of my fiends, she encouraged us to let her know in advance and that she had some 'special dishes' she'd like to share with us - we promised to return soon!\n\nWe ranked it 4 out of 5 stars because a few of the basil leaves we're discolored, but we did not feel like it affected the quality nor the flavors we enjoyed.\n\nWe're really happy to see Viet Kitchen open in the neighborhood and expect to become regulars."
0,"We were excited for this new little Mexican addition to the south side.  The service here is inattentive at best. We were left sitting at our table forever. No one seemed to know whose table was whose, nor did they seem to care. We finally asked for wait staff to bring us water, cutlery and a menu. Not good for a new place."
1,"I have lived in Phoenix most of my life but had never lived in 'Dirty Phoenix' (West PHX east Glendale) as I call it and in the last year bought a house literally down the street from the place. So my first month in the house I am driving around finding where all the grocery stores are and such and drive right by this place called O'Brien's. It looked like a cool little dive bar which is my kind of place. \n\nO'Brien's is my hang out now. I love the place, the bartenders are all very cool and very quick with my favorite drink..Capt-n-Coke and the food is really good. Its not too big and not too small and you get all kinds inside. its not just a biker bar, or gay bar or metal bar..its just a good bar. Justine, Kat, Hope and Tara are awesome."
1,"This place is fantastic! I've been there a few times for business lunches and everyone has always been happy. The pizzas are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge). Everything looks and tastes fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same price. Although the line can back up at lunch (much like a Chipotle) since everything is made to order, the pizza is done in 3 minutes after being cooked in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any seatign even when the line is long. I actually think this pizza is better than 90% of pizza I've had elsewhere. To me, it's worthy of 5 starts. I just wish they had one right where I live."
0,"BEWARE! My review is only for this lady who I had the worst haircut experience with in my entire life.  I didn't get her name but she's medium to heavy size caucasian woman and has tattoos on her body.  Her section is far left when you enter the door.\n\nAside from getting the worse haircut she was extremely unprofessional and had a negative attitude from the beginning.  She asked for every detail on how to give the haircut, every snip! It was extremely frustrating since it was her job as a stylist to understand the look and feel, not be a robot with scissors.  \n\nTo summarize, avoid at all cost. Plently of other hair cut places around - don't waste your time, money, and risk your image."
0,"So I've been here twice. First time I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss and some Smashfries. To go. It was alright. Wasn't overwhelmed - I was hungry and it hit the spot. Next time I came with some coworkers. We were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation. But that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food. This time I got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese burger. I know. Sounds pretty metrosexual but I was curious. I also got the Haystack Onions. Well when I bit into the burger, I had to wonder if Bessie, the cow I was biting into, hadn't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days. Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too. The Einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down. Yeah yeah. The place is still \""new.\"" So this is the moment - like in a game of Hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts, as they say. I'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around. We ain't coming back. Sorry. Smashburger apparently isn't for everyone."
0,"If I could rate zero stars I would. Bartender was cordial, not his problem but $18 for a bottled bud light with a free drink coupon changed my entire night. What in the world?? This cannot be Las Vegas,  I must be in Prague. Never and I mean ever going back to this ridiculousness."
1,Nice shop. Good music. They were able to take me as a walk in. Perfect price. This is now where I will be getting my hair cut from now on.
0,This place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature mid-life crisis. The only friendly bartender is the girl whom I wish would be there more often.
1,Premium drinks. Whether I'm in need for caffeine boost or a relaxing personalized and seasonal cocktail. Have always been so pleased with their product!\n\nFood and pastry selections never disappoint.\n\nIt's not surprising that this place is busting at the seams busy but I can't say that I've ever felt neglected or that their quality of service/product has suffered!
1,"As you probably already can guess, this event is a cluster and it is pretty uncomfortable running in a full santa suit. (The beard kept hitting me in the face and blinding me!)  Nevertheless, it was a lot of fun.  Here are my tips from my first year doing this:\n\n1. Show up early.  There's lots going on two hours before the race starts, you can stake out a good parking space, and you can take photos.  Then go back to the car and put your crap away.  Easy!\n2. Speaking of parking, if you have a high clearance vehicle and/or offroad vehicle consider parking in the gravel lot behind Fry's that fronts LV Blvd.  It was difficult getting out after the race and if you park there, and can get out, you can bail pretty easily.  But only offroad/high clearance vehicles!  I saw a few Camrys that got stuck. :(\n3. Safety first! Especially if you are doing the half or full marathon the next day.  There are tons of kids, dogs (some not so well behaved), strollers, and other weird things.  People are excitable.  Some people forgot they were running with a dog on a leash and clotheslined people.  The streets at Town Square are narrow.  So, if in doubt, slow down and employ defensive running/walking.  I saw some nasty spills that could have been avoided.  You don't want to be injured for the big race the next day for some 5K that isn't even timed.\n\nThis isn't a five star event mostly for the traffic direction.  They need to suck it up and hire Metro.  Town Square security did the traffic direction and they sucked at it.  The guys directing traffic for me (near the entrance to Frys) actually got into a fight with each other!  Come on guys!  \n\nBut still I had a ton of fun, came out unscathed, and I finally got my I Love Yelp t-shirt to boot!  Who doesn't love that?"
1,I took 2 computers within 2 days and both issues were resolved.  Very nice and explains what the problems were. Very affordable.
1,"I really dig this venue. The Roots were playing on the night I went - I arrived early to start the night off with drinks and some of their famous fried chicken. \n\nThe fried chicken was top notch. Loved the seasoning on it. Probably the best I've had in this city (Note: Vegas isn't really known for fried chicken). Super juicy, but not too greasy. Real good combo with some beer (Magic Hat on tap) . Came up to $20 for 4 pieces of chicken, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and a slice of white bread. Wasn't too hungry so I shared it with a friend. Good stuff to munch on while waiting. You can either eat indoors or outdoors with a view of the Linq that's great for people watching.\n\nAs a music venue, it's really great too. It's just an overall fun atmosphere to be around. Plenty of bars, lots of walking room, and a outdoor 2nd story patio for some air. I also liked the fact that you can get away from the stage to some seats where you can actually hear conversations with company.\n\nI didn't get to try out the bowling, but the alley looked really modern and trendy. More upscale than most bowling alleys that I've seen.\n\nAll in all, a really great venue that offers a lot to do. It looks like they have some great artists lined up to perform in the future. I'm definitely going to be dropping by here often."
0,"Saw this bar from our hotel and figured it would be nice to walk across the street for a drink. However, we waited for over 15 minutes and had several waiters walk by while making eye contact and did not once ask us if we wanted anything. I could understand that if it was busy but it was a Wednesday night with less than half the tables full.  Only reason it got 2 stars is because it was a beautiful night out and the place would have been cool if it wasn't for the lack of service..."
1,"I'm hesitant on this four star choice, but it isn't three stars. let me explain.\n\ngood people first off - nice bartenders, nice owner, friendly and chill.\n\nfood - was fabulously good, however portion size is supe small. so if you're on a diet and want small portions for ridiculous pricing - this would be the place. \n\ndrinks - creative and special is how i would put it. i like the creativity they put onto new drinks and turning classic drinks to something special. i would add that they could just leave the super classics to be classics. not to be overly crazy about making something super special. but all in all - drinks are still a plus here. \n\nthe place is small and seating is limited, however a nice touch is that there is outside seating. there are tables you can eat off of and if you come on a good night, there's plenty of space available since this is fairly new."
0,"For the price I expected more, a lot more.  I went here for lunch about 5 years ago and was disapopinted by the lack of selection.  There are many other better buffets to choose from, like at Paris, or Encore/Wynn.  I would skip this one, not worth it.\n\nDerek"
0,"If you're hungry... make sure you EAT BEFORE YOU GET THERE. The entrees are sold as , \""small plates for sharing\"" -  however, how do you share 4 muscles and 6 clams for $16. The pitch is, 'the portions are smaller but the quality is higher\"" which is suppose to explain the pricing - sadly this didnt explain my dry and over-cooked rib-eye.\n\nWe ended up buying several plates and by the time you're full - you've easily spend $200 for two people. There are better and more fulfilling options out there. \n\nWine selection is poor but you can smoke cigars on the patio. \n\nSide note: Server was in training and did a good job."
1,"Caramel is beautiful. Saying \""carmel\"" like \""caramel\"" is weird. Yep, if you pronounce the A, then I'm one of those people who irritates you by not pronouncing it. It's a colloquialism, mmmkay? But, for this bar's name's sake, I say it the way I guess I'm supposed to.\n\nAnyhow. Caramel is beautiful. The service has always been excellent. It's a classy joint where you can get away with wearing your cargos and Chuck Taylors and never hear a word about it. And, this place satisfies those rare urges of mine when I want to go to a club, but don't want to deal with the usual club hassles."
1,So happy to see familiar faces after Way Sushi closed. The sushi is fresh and the specialty roll menu original and delicious (the surf and turf is the BEST). Will be our new go to..
0,"While in AZ I thought any Mexican restaurant would be good, I was wrong. My husband's uncle and wife raved about this place so we tagged along for dinner. This restaurant is located in a plaza. Upon entering the resturant You notice it is decorated really nice. I loved the Spanish decorating and the whole restaurant vibe. When we arrived we had to wait for them to fix a large table so we took the kids to the bathroom. The bathrooms were nicely done as well and very clean. After we finished in the restroom we were seated and our waitress came out. She was very nice and she took our drink orders & salsa orders. They have a couple of kinda of salsas. I was not impressed by their house salsa --and usually I'm down for salsa and chips but this salsa was a no go. The chips weren't even great. I ordered the cheese dip and this was actually pretty good. I ordered a chimichanga but it was not good at all and there was no cheese in it or on top of it and it did not taste good. I ended up sending it back and not ordering anything else. I tried my daughter's and husband's food and I wasn't impressed with that either. This place only gets a two due to the decorations and the good service. Food wise ---they did not represent Mexican food right."
0,"My second time with a large group of people and it was just as bad, probably worse. The food tasted great! Green chili burger was fabulous. Service was as good as it could be. Obviously something is terribly disorganized behind the scenes cause it takes forever to get a meal here. Worst of all, we had reservations! It was more than a 2 hour lunch when we had planned for a 1 hour lunch. Needless to say, expectations were far from met. Too many good restaurants in the area to settle for this."
1,Love this place! Their pho has that traditional home made Viet taste and very fast and good service. Highly recommended.
0,"Originally I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but after I thought it over, it's at best 2.5 stars.  But since there is no 1/2 star, based on the experience, I rounded it down to 2. \n\nWe had to wait for a good 15 minutes even though there were empty tables and despite I was told that we would be first on the list since I was a diamond card holder.  Their reason - to give the servers time to catch up.  Huh?\n\nWe were seated at a booth and it took awhile before our server finally came.  We ordered and then we waited, and waited, and waited!!!  Our server apologized twice for the delay of our food and took our drinks off the bill.  Even she didn't understand why the delay and said 'This is ridiculous!'.  \n\nWhen we finally got the food.  Holy Jesus!  They were HUGE!!!  Had I known how much the food was going to be, we could have shared 1 entree!\n\nI had the Sage Friend Chicken Salad with Mango Vinaigrette Dressing - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=RdfzlSuVWa3eLeZnlGumyw.  It was a WHOLE piece of friend chicken breast which didn't have much flavor at all.  I asked for some ranch dressing (all they had was cucumber ranch dressing) to dip the chicken with.  I quite like the Mango Vinaigrette Dressing but there was just so much food.  I kept eating and eating but there was still mounts of food.  I finally gave up and probably only ate 1/5 of the plate!  I think sometimes where the portion is so big, it actually ruins your appetite!\n\nMy fiance had a bacon burger - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FcGwvwVxr1GdWl653lcnHA.  He said the patties were dry and didn't have much flavor, but fries were good.  \n\nI also ordered a lemonade ice tea that was just bad!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=IC67vw3HBWwLHf2O0wadcA Stick with regular iced.  \n\nI had a coupon (I know, I know, here I go with the coupon again) for $25, our bill was less than $27 (since the drinks were comp'ed).  I only had to pay less than $2 (exclude tips).  I gave her extra tips since she was nice enough to comp our drinks.\n\nThe only way I'd return is if I can eat free (or almost free like this).  With my own money, I'd rather go somewhere with better food!"
0,I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.
0,"This sucks. I am still sitting inside Villa Pizza at a dirty table waiting for my chicken wings and fries. It has now been over 40 minutes that I've been waiting and no food in sight. Plus this place is freezing.  It is 46 degrees outside and not much warmer inside, and I am sitting as far as possible from the front door. This is my first horrible restaurant experience and I'm glad I have my iPhone to draft this review. \n\nNever again!"
1,"The spa lobby was quite stunning. We were blown away when we walked in. It was like a palace!\n\nWe first used their facilities, which was quite impressive. There were different lounges of locker rooms, private changing rooms, waterfall showers, heated patio stone chairs. \n\nWe booked the massage last minute, they were able to accommodate us, which was nice. We had a couple massage there. The massage was good. I almost felt asleep during the treatment. \n\nI have to take off one star because it was pretty expensive---$180 for 50 minutes for each person."
1,"I love this place but be careful you WILL overeat! Also, making reservations is better than not! And eat the meat and not the salad bar or you won't get your money's worth!"
1,"I just tried this restaurant and all I can say its wow, the food is amazing. I got the lentil soup which was full of flavor, the falafel appetizer was the best I've had in a very long time. I also got the kafta kebab, it came with two sides. Great portions and excellent flavor. The owner was very nice and even gave me a chicken wrap to try. Omg, I'm a fan, it was delicious. I'm definitely going back and recommending it to anyone that enjoys good food and excellent service for a very affordable price."
1,"I loved this place! My BFF4LIFE.. made a good choice! The room was beautiful... nice view, distance mountains. The location was a bit off the strip (which I didn't mind) but it was banging! The staff was lovely, the guest were friendly and the ALCOHOL WS... FREEEEEE! =)"
1,"Didn't think you'd come to Vegas for a burger, did you!?  Well, this ain't a mere burger.  It's a burger with a capital 'B'!\n\nAll three times, I've had some form of addition and subtraction to my basic burger - medium juicy patty and a ton of fresh raw onion.  That to me is probably all I would go for on a normal day... no cheese.  Cheese always seem to overtake the taste of everything else it's added on, for me.  But add an egg cooked over-easy, real bacon and some jalepenos... omfg - I'm having a burgasm!\n\nI always almost have the black angus 'coz I wouldn't get the kobe beef.  \nI just think it's kind of silly that they called it American Kobe beef... Kobe as we all know, is nowhere near America and the ones they serve here are from Idaho... ummm... \n\nBut this is a good place for a cold beer (they really are as cold as beer should be, I'm told), a very very VERY good Burger and a nice ambiance with surprisingly not many rowdy kids considering it's a burger place - maybe they too are too busy  having their mini burgasms to be annoying :)  Again, they might need a new host (she's as stupid as she looks) but everyone else is great.  Still can't get over the twins who work there - they always throw me off :)"
1,My sis recommended this place to me. I wasn't sure at first but I made an appointment (I think her name was Kay) and my hair turned out great!!!! And James is very busy and each appt. looked like it lasted 30 min. Kay spent a little an hour with me. She kept checking the layers even after she blow dry my hair. Definitely going back for my next haircut!!!!!!!
1,"One of the best meals of my life (and I REALLY like to eat well:).  We stumbled into a tasting menu from a world renown chef.  It wasn't cheap ($150 for 7 course tasting menu and $80 for wine pairing each), but it was world class.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation, but we were there at 5:30 - so we were offered a spot at the bar, despite the restaurant being booked for the evening.\n\nOur bartender was friendly and fun, and made the experience a great one."
1,Fabulous salon! I am very picky when it comes to my nails and like them to look PERFECT. \nNow there was a time when my nails did not come out absolutely the way I liked it and I called to see if I can have it fixed. Cindy was super nice and apologetic that my pedicure did not look the way I liked it (I really am anal about my nails). I came in the following day and she fixed it for me. Good costumer service is really important and you will definitely get it here. Not every salon will care about their customers as much as this salon does. \nA salon with staff like this one is truly a rarity and am happy I found it.
0,I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.
0,"Horrible service, ok burgers, good fries. Overpriced and a la carte ordering (burgers and fries separate). Waitress didn't place our order with the kitchen then offered 15% off after waiting 1.5 hours for burgers and fries. Nice patio seating in Oakland."
0,"This is what you might expect from Vegas, tropicana as \""fresh squeezed\"", corn syrup for maple, incredibly sweet breakfasts that if you're 14 you might like. A mocha cappuccino was clearly made by dumping some chocolate syrup in a cup and putting it under a vending machine. The old lady next to me loved it....doubt she uses yelp. Steer clear.\n\nPleasant setting and strong wifi. ;)"
0,"The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \""things\"" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better."
0,"Don't take your phones here. I brought in my iphone yesterday to get the screen replaced. While they did a good job on the repair, there became another issue. On the way to get my screen replaced I was charging my phone in my truck. Well after the repair to my screen I can no longer charge my phone. I went in today to let them know about the  issue and said I had a bad battery. Well I just upgraded my battery 6 months ago I told the employee behind the counter and they did not have an answer for me. I told them my phone was charging right before the screen replacement was done as well. He took the back plate off today to check the connections and said it was the battery. Well when I left the store  I realized that there is now a purple spot on the screen that they replaced yesterday. Well there goes $39 bucks for shitty service.\n\nDON\""T BRING YOUR DEVICES HERE!!!!!!!!"
0,I ordered 3 eggs and bacon * includes three pieces of bacon that didn't look very appetizing and cold toast I expected better from Bellagio I have has better bacon at Mom and Pop places..\n.
0,"Last night was the second time I tried it, and still have the same problem. 1. Dough has an uncooked taste 2.they only have a red sauce for the pizza, and that just leads to much acid in my system. So I will stick to making my own our will stick to dominos who at least uses real Spinach not out of a can! So gross!"
0,Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.
1,This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9.
0,"This place sells... Yup, you guessed it! Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on."
1,"I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch, but they always look delicious. Some of their regular sushi rolls are a little pricey, but other than that, no complaints. A great lunch spot!"
0,"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether."
1,"I  first sampled a taste of Prima's food at a work function, which is why I sought out the cafe for dinner with my roomie. \nWe were greeted warmly as we entered, and went to the counter and ordered an albanian sald and a buffalo chicken pizza.\nWe did notice that there were several specials . My roomie asked if there were pitchers of soda because she drinks a lot during dinner.\nThe waitress laughed and said \""we do free refills\"" \nWe sat down at a table and The waitress ended up bringing another soda to the table , and told my roomie \""Oh I thought you might be close to needing another\""  \nAnticipation of needs is awesome service if you ask me!!\nThe Albanian salad  was absolutely delicious. It had grilled eggplant and tomato , feta  cheese other veggies . it was fresh and they served it with homemade dressings . We tried bot hthe balsamic and the ranch. \nOur pizza came and it was fresh and hot and  completely YUM. \nWe had so much food that we had to take leftovers home. \nI will totally be back as I want another salad. I am also thinking I want to try the pasta."
1,"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  What a great find!  Next husband I have, is getting a wedding band from this store.  Very manly looking designs, beautiful, handsome, high quality.  I'd be very proud to have a band from here on my next dude's finger.  Stop by if you can.  Tucked into the inner depths of Fashion Square Mall.  Be sure to take a map and water and a flare gun."
1,"Oh how I wish I lived in Phoenix, so I could become a regular here. For those of you who are also on the quest to find authentic Japanese restaurants in the US, go to Hiro's if you find yourself in the area.  From the initial, \""Irrashai!\"" As we walked in, the experience was like being in a little sushi joint in Japan.  My companion noted several times how great the service was and I have to agree.  I was excited to see Okinawa Soba on the menu so gave that a shot along with Otoro, salmon, Hamachi and Kani.   Ok, so the Toro did not need to be chewed it merely melted...heaven.  The last time I had Okinawa Soba was in Japan and this was the real deal even to include the hot pepper infused Awamori (ok, it was actually Vodka, but tasted the same). Our waitress had just moved here from Okinawa three years ago. \n\nWe had a Japanese rice beer... An import that was very good. \n\nSooo, this was overall an excellent experience and I'm glad we found it"
0,"Great place just ruined by REALLY poor management decisions: \n1st time I was there NO drivers allowed (!!!) WTF? Isn't it a driving range??? Oh, maybe they didn't build a tall enough fence?? Why should I pay for YOUR mistakes? Ask for a discount, all I got was a \""sorry\"". Second time: NO drivers & NO hybrids (!!!) and best for last... This last weekend..: NO irons from upper decks (!!!) Yes, you've heard correctly; If you want to use your OWN irons you have to play from the lower deck, otherwise you MUST use the lame (and short) clubs provided by the place. It is a real shame that an amazing place like this has been ruined by such POOR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. I will not go back to that place until they allow the use of ALL clubs (driver included). Make's no sense what they are doing. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. POTENTIALLY A GREAT PLACE JUST RUINED BY MANAGEMENT."
1,The family went last night after visiting North Lake Mall. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. Service was quick. Place was very busy.  I had the half-chicken plate and wife had the pulled pork plate. The plates come with two sides and garlic bread  Children had pork sandwich and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers can be ordered grilled which is healthier than fried  Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions are good sized.  The BBQ sauces came in three varieties and were tasty. The sweet tea was also good.  Drinks are self-service.  The place was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful  I gave it four stars because the place was much better than average in all aspects and we will return when we are in the area.
1,"Discovered this little truck during the Vegas StrEATS fest and it did NOT disappoint!  The wait was like 45 minutes, but so worth it.\n\nThis isn't snow cone land, the ice consistency is smooth and sleek. It's a different texture.\n\nThe Large is $5 and the Regular is $4.\n\nYou can choose up to 3 flavors per Shave Ice. They have approximately 30+ flavors to choose. From classics like cherry and bubblegum (regular and blue) to traditional Hawaii flavors, to several types of cakes. \n\nSome add ons like ice cream and sour spray and other stuff I don't recall are only .50 to $1 to add. Condensed milk is free (if you've never had condensed milk on a snowy treat, do it; you are welcome). \n\nThey have a Twitter so you can find them on the go and webpage they update! Definitely check it out. One of the cheapest and tastiest ways to beat the Summer heat in Vegas!"
0,"I hate that feeling when you tell your server that you have a travel zoo, and wait to see whether they are cool, or treat you like a leper, guess where we fell? The couple behind my husband got the most amazing service because they got a prix fix meal with the wine pairing ( good for them!) the cocktails we ordered ( not included in the TZ) were short, and the drinks that came with the voucher tasted like sea water. Our bar bill itself was $100 so we always pay way over our coupon voucher. My husband ordered the seafood pot and salmon,which he found to his liking. I ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side. My chicken and the little side thing ( veggies?) it came with were dry. They also gave us a palate cleanser of squash soup ( was it supposed to be cold?) and some fishy paste, blah! I don't know, I was expecting the same service that I got from their sister restaurant, Andres but there was no comparison. The views are pretty. The only great thing was the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, that was good stuff. Not enough for us to be back though. Thank god we didn't tell the host we had the TZ like that other unlucky poster! I would've really had been pissed if we were sat facing a wall. if you don't like people with coupon vouchers stop listing them, it's as easy as that."
1,"Pros and Cons of our visit to Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant. \n\nPros\n*Food was really tasty. \n*Nice menu with lots of pictures and unique items. \n*Large portions of food at affordable prices. \n* Food was very tasty!\n\nCons\n*Poor service, (I'm only rating my visit) \nWait staff just seemed uninterested/unfriendly. But this is Vegas. What did I expect. \n\n\nSummary\n I'd go back lots of yummy looking food pictured on the menu I did not order today."
0,I double checked to make sure we went to the right restaurant. I would rate the food as edible but not good. Very disappointing after reading all of the reviews. Wasted money on the cab ride in addition to the bill.
1,"We found out about this bakery thru Yelp.  We had been wanting to try out those almond croissants for quite some time.  We happened to be in the area on an early Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately for us, they were out!  No croissants of any kind!   We opted for an apple pastry and a pistachio eclair.  Both were delicious.  Can't wait to visit, again."
0,Food was good...plenty of tv's to watch the game but we were served a mug of beer with lipstick on it and the idiot manager opened the glass wall with it being 100 degrees out to accommodate one outside table leaving all of us at the bar to sweat our a!#&* off. Poor management..... we will never return
0,"My 13mo old husky Nahla was hit by a car on Christmas Eve while visiting California,  we did all we could to stabilizer her in CA spending almost $5000.  She was diagnosed with a fractured left leg and pulmonary contusion, and pulled 100cc of air/fluid from each lung, and the prognosis looked okay, just needed to have her leg repaired with a rod.  And was put in an oxygen tank for several hours and was released on the 26 at 7am and wanted us to take her back to the vet that stabilized her so we can get surgery on her leg.  Well I opted to take her to Vegas to her regular vet here at Camini Al Norte as I was comfortable to have Nahla closer to home.  Little did I know after calling them 2x before taking her that they do not do the surgery there and I asked about making payment arrangements since I depleted our funds when we were treating her in California.  So they said they don't so that and they would have to so X-rays.  So we were able to come up with funds and as Dr. H calls us in the room, she said the prognosis was bad, and said by listening to Nahla's chest she has fluid in her lungs once again, and that the repair for her leg was secondary right now which I understand.  So I requested pain meds so I can take her home to let her pass with us by her side.  When I paid the bill it was for the exam as well as the pain meds and noticed Nahla was not even put under the X-ray.  So it hurts me to believe that it was because we didn't have the money initially (but was able to come up with it without mentioning it to the vet) that they denied to really do what they can.  We left at 1:00pm from Camino Al Norte.   So Nahla has been eating and still breathing the same as when we left California, she tried standing and kept falling on her front left foot.  I pulled the bandages off and she still has the catheter in her arm, which I brought Camino Al Norte her IV bag (which was disconnected) from the Cali hospital.   So Camino Al Norte did not really check her.  \n\nI called the California emergency hospital to let them know if I can remove the catheter myself and they were kinda disgusted with the treatment here in Vegas and asked if we wanted to take her back there.   But Nahla has been through too much already, so now I'm just going to take her to another vet in the morning to remove the catheter and get a second opinion.   I am so heartbroken and can't stop crying.  My baby does not deserve this at all.  I feel so helpless right now."
0,"Let me start by saying that I've been to this ER 10 times, and have been admitted for a 3-5 day stay 8 times over the last 3 years. \nI have a chronic kidney condition that acts up every couple months and usually leaves me laid up for a week in excruciating pain.\n\nAfter my last 2 experiences, I will never come back to this ER EVER again, if I can help it.\n\nER review: \nWhen I first came here after my surgeries, everyone was kind, attentive, and VERY good...getting IVs was fairly painless (for getting an IV).\n\nThe second to last time I was in, I gave them my back story (chronic kidney pain, CANNOT do a CT, because I had a surgical clip left inside of me that looks like a kidney stone when a CT is done.  They have to do a renal scan).\n\nTwo hours of pain later, the radiology guy comes back to give me a CT.  \nOk fine...but can I get SOMETHING for the pain?  \""We have to give you a non-narcotic.\""  Ok fine, I know my history makes me look like a drug seeker (which I'm not).  \""Non-Narcotics trash my kidneys and make me ill.  Call my surgeon, Dr. _____.  I always get dilauded when I'm in here. 2 mg, with Zofran for the nausea.\""   \n\n\""Well we can give you morphine\""\n\n\""Can someone please look at my records?  I'm allergic.  Morphine makes me itch.  How about an asprin?  Something?  SOMETHING to take the edge off until you talk to a Doctor about getting me pain killers.\""\n\nSo they finally get me something...and I get it, you have to weed out the seekers.  I've heard them before.  But after waiting two hours, not complaining at all, not ASKING for any painkillers till that point...plus they can look up my records.\n\nNevermind the fact that it took 3 people to start my IV.  *sigh*\n\nAnyway, after all this, they give me a CT...and surprise!  \""You have a stone.\""\nme: \""No I don't, I have a surgical clip that was left inside me.  I told them this at admitting.  You have to do an ultrasound or a renal scan.\""\n\nSo they finally do and guess what...ITS A CLIP, NOT A STONE!!  *sigh*\nIdiots.  Not all of us are clueless here.\n\nSo they admit me.  Detailed hospital review to follow.  \nThe LAST time I went to the ER, I was having chest pains. \n\nThey took me right back for an EKG, which apparently was normal?  Because I sat in an empty waiting room for two hours before they brought me back for further examination.\n\nThey said \""Its not your heart.  Here, we're going to give you morphine and a nitro drip.\""\n\nme:  \""um.  What?  Why am I getting morphine?  I'm allergic.\""\n\n\""Well what do you usually get?\""\n\nMe: \""Dilauded...but I don't...\""\n\nThem (cutting me off) \""Well we don't give that for heart issues.\""\n\nMe: \""Number 1, you JUST said it wasn't my heart.  Number two...I don't WANT a pain killer, I want to know what is wrong with me.  Number three, if it isn't my heart, WHY are you giving me a nitro drip?  No.  Sorry.  I'm going home.\""  \n\nSigned out AMA.  Not that I actually GOT any medical advice, but I figured if I was going to die, I wanted to do so in my own bed.   (turns out I was just REALLY stressed.)\n\nSo...onto the Hospital stays.\n\nAgain, when I first was admitted, everyone was awesome.  \n\nThe last 2 times I was admitted was AWFUL.\n\nI had Nurses who gave me attitude, doctors prescribing blood thinner shots, and ANTIDEPRESSANTS (for a kidney issue.  Yeah...what sense does that make?)\n\nSo...Whenever I'm admitted to the hospital, I'm on dilauded for 3-4 days.  The first 2 days, I ALWAYS get sick.  ALWAYS.  Even with Zofran for nausea.  I always throw up at least once.  \n\nThe second to last time I was in, it was my first night.  I was in pain, miserable, and just got hit with a wave of nausea.  I tried to get out of bed to grab a bucket, trash can, get to the bathroom, anything, but I didn't make it, and I vomited on the floor next to my bed. So now, I'm in pain, miserable, nauseated, and embarrassed.  And the nurse gave me attitude about it.  Yes.  I vomited on the floor JUST to piss you off.\n\nThe last time I was in, I had a similar experience, I was being wheeled up to my room, and was vomiting in a bucket (sometimes you just can't help it) and the nursing staff looked absolutely disgusted.\nThis is your JOB.  To take care of people who are ill...if you have to look disgusted about a little vomit, at least walk away first.  Don't make us feel worse.\n\nI will NEVER come back here again, unless I am unconscious and have no choice."
1,"First time there, and we had  good experience! We ordered for a large party and it was fresh and ready in less than 10 minutes, portions are enormous and very reasonably priced. I am a sucker for chicken fried rice and it was of the best I've ever had! I enjoyed the potstickers, very meaty. My husband got the orange chicken and he felt that the breading could have been crispier, but really enjoyed the flavor. My guess is that it was made fresh and put in to-go containers which may have caused it to steam and soften by the time we got home. I found that the hot and sour soup was oddly too smoky in flavor, but very rich. All in all I am very happy with this experience and can't wait to go back and try other dishes!"
1,"I had lunch here just last week and I forgot to post my review. So, I was really surprised at how delicious everything was. I'm a vegetarian and find it difficult to find eating places that have more than one item for me to choose from. The waitstaff was very pleasant and helpful- very courteous. The best dish was the okra, not sure the name of it, but it was awesome! Pricing for the buffet is reasonable and I will definitely return, and bring more people with me!"
1,"This Great Dane Hilldale location is in my neighborhood.  It is a reliable choice when meeting a group of friends before a movie or just for a few drinks.  The staff is usually spot on professional and friendly.  \n\nMy usual order is the James Madison (half sandwich and bowl of soup) with the Cuban and the West African Chicken Peanut Stew.  So flavorful and tasty.  There is nothing better on a cold day then this stew.  They do make great burgers, too.  And I can not complain about their starters.\n\nBut one of the best reasons to go is for the Beer.  I enjoy trying all their styles."
0,"Disgusting! Ordered Guacamole & chips, though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance, flavor was horrible. Pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it. Food was cold, not even room temperature. Will not go back! No stars are warranted for this place."
1,"I went here Sunday afternoon w/ some friends. They seemed pretty busy for only being open a couple days. My group started with the queso dip appetizer. The dip had a very delicious cheese flavor, the tortilla chips were crunchy and fresh.\n\nWhile waiting for the appetizer we ordered some flights of beer. They were out of flight glasses so they ended up pouring 3 pints for the price of a flight for my friend and I ended up just getting a pint, no complaints there. The beer selection was quite nice as to be expected for a spin off of Boulders on Broadway.\n\nBeing brand new, I expected some kinks needing to be worked out and there were a few. I got the grilled cheese for my meal, excellent sandwich but I had to send the fries back because they were barely cooked. They made up for it by quickly replacing them with extra crispy sweet potato fries. Next mishap? Charging for the 2nd flight we never got. They quickly corrected the problem and went beyond redemption by 1) buying me my pint and 2) giving me a coupon for a free pint next time I stop by. Minor annoyances and they are clearly moving in the right direction. \n\nThe food prices seem to be in line with a neighborhood grill. The beer prices seem a bit cheaper than you'd find at most places (especially for craft beer, $3.50 drafts for happy hour? hell yea). Finally, a craft beer spot in my neighborhood within walking distance. I'll be going back for sure."
1,"BEST buffet I have had so far in Vegas!!! Much better than the one at Wynn.\n\nMy friends and I went there on a Thursday night and it wasn't crowded at all. I love their individual plates and awesome dessert selection! Our server was super nice and friendly. Their decor is modern and chic. Food wise, two of my favorites are the bone marrow, and creamed corn. You have to save some room for their desserts! \n\nI definitely want to go there again next time I am in town."
1,Andrea is professional and efficient--as painless as a wax can be.  It's easy to set an appointment with her and she is always quick to respond to my texts.  I've been going to her for over a year and think her service is great. Pricing is reasonable and oftentimes you can get a groupon!   I highly recommend her to others.
0,"I was really disappointed by the PH Suites.\nIt's kind of like Ikea furniture -- looks nice from afar, but come close & everything starts to fall apart.. \n\n1) There was not  a single mirror in our room aside from the one in the bathroom - no full length mirror at all!!! Ladies & Gentlemen, this is a problem!\n2) Several of our dishes were dirty with caked up food/lipstick stain\n3) The mini fridge door would have to be lifted in order to shut\n4) The leather couch had white stains from I dont want to know what\n5) The maintenance forgot to stock the coffee\n\nWhen checking out, I mentioned a few of these things to the staff & instead of recieving an apology, I was told that the Suites don't come with mirrors...okay?!\n\nI have stayed at the Trump for the same rate in the SUMMER time (busier) \nand the room was 2x as big, 3x more luxurious, and had courteous staff!"
1,"Clean, nicely decorated, calm nail salon.  We were greeted and taken immediately, without an appointment.  The technicians were nice and professional.  My mom had a gel mani and regular pedi, I had just a pedi.  They let me stay in the massage chair the whole duration of my moms services- some places have made me get out of the chair even though they didn't need it :( .  We're not frequent nail salon people but I think they did a good job!"
0,"The sushi is dry, the service was okay, the manager/owner kept on \""looking over our shoulders\"" like a hawk though out the entire time we were eating.  My friend told me once that it was rude to stare at people while they were eating and that always stuck with me.  \n\nIf you have a party of 4 and over tipping is included- 4 and over?!  If the quality was good and the owner didn't have such a bad attitude I'd be willing to recommend this to my buddies and understand the amount of people required to automatically tip 18%.\n\nOverall, this is an establishment that I wouldn't want to support, and that is why I'm writing this review.  Besides the unreasonable owner, bad sushi (the salmon tasted like rubber with uniformed cut up bite sizes, wtf?!  I didnt like it), rude experience, we should have heeded the warning when two customers left without eating.  Probably because the wait was so long to get their food.\n\nHikari, no go!  \n\nSushi Mon is more better, more flavor!"
0,"Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \""no tomato\""? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service."
0,"Stopped by for some lunch, saw this place just driving by. Prices are decent, you get about 3 pieces of a roll for the varying prices. I did get a wiff of spoiled food a few times. I dunno what it was from, but it prevented me from furthering our meal. The service is pretty horrendous, our server didn't even know what siracha was. Asked if I meant eel sauce in a condescending tone. Excuse me what?! I tried several different rolls and was not impressed by any of it. My son had the orange chicken and it was so tangy, he nor I could finish it. I will not be coming back"
0,"Horrible Service! We tried tonight to use a coupon we received in the mail, but after we were seated in the dining room,  no one ever showed up to offer beverages or acknowledge our presence in anyway.  Waiters would repeatedly walk right by our booth without even looking at us, let alone stopping (they were not busy and there were quite a few empty tables). Finally after 15 minutes of being totally ignored we gave up and walked out. I wish I could give negative stars, this place is really abysmal. I will never return and have tossed the coupons in the trash."
0,"Eh. That's really it... The chips were strips of chips and they were too thin so it was kinda like eating crumbs because they kept breaking. The salsa was eh. My husband ordered a carne asada plate and about 1/8th of the plate was meat, the rest was beans and rice. The meat was dry. For paying an extra few bucks to get some meat on my salad, I should have received something that looked like meat? Instead there were crumbs of ground what-can-only-asssumed-to-be-meat interspersed through my bowl of lettuce (because the presence of other salad-like ingredients was sorely lacking.) I guess that's my mistake for ordering a salad at a Mexican joint.\n\nThe server was pretty awesome though,  she was really on top of it. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy and quaint,  it looks like one of the walls opens up to the patio which might be cool when it's not 120\u00b0 outside. \n\nThe prices didn't match the food quality.  Maybe it was a bad day or a growing pain? Eh. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe."
1,Best chicken nachos ever.  \nThe price is $7-something but I think it is worth every penny!\nI am addicted to their nachos and I would keep going back just for their nachos.\n\nI tasted their chicken nachos but the price for one small taco is almost $3 and I do not think its worth it at all.  The chicken is tasty but I would rather go to taco bell or del taco to satisfy my craving for tacos. \n\nThe cashier & I think he is the cook isnt too friendly but the owner of the place is really nice!
1,"Glutonous is all I can say. Salami plate with peppers, tempura/fried squash blossom with Lobster and Lobster Mousse, calamari,  A Mid course of beef cheek ravioli, gnocchi in a bolognese and black fettucinni with dungeness crab. Veal chop, Porterhouse and Ribeye as the entree. I couldn't move but managed to choke down some Hazelnut Semifreddo with a glass of Tokjai. \n\nThe food was amazing, the service over the top and the peppered lardo was to die for."
0,Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.\nWe won't be going back.
1,"Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!"
0,First of all when I check in she asked me if I'm the one that owned a dog and when I replied  yes she said I can't even let you on the premises cause this is not a pet friendly place AT ALL .. Yet on the front page of there website it says pet friendly..this was the manager telling me this ... She had the gal to tell me that it's not  even offered on the website... Someone is out of touch with there own company policy.. I called for reservations and they are the one that told me it would be a $25.00  a night extra for the dog...don't waste your time coming to this place...
1,Sensational and Orgasmic! Mark made me feel so relaxed with his magic hands. Ask for him ladies when you go in.
1,Came here for the happy hour. They have 5 drinks priced at $5 and they have 7 appetizers priced at $7\nThe drinks were amazing due to our having a fantastic bartender named PJ..I actually went to the Facebook page to give him props since he was so fab to us.\nThey have this wonderful app thats a fried asparagus..it has a light tempura coating and comes with a garlic aioli thats addicting.\nWe also had some polenta fries with a spicy dipping sauce. Those were good but will order a double of the asparagus next time.\nIt was a great ending to a great day.
0,"Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price."
1,Sake bombs and mackerel. The great price and great location make it a good spot for me to start at before my night out on most weekends. Try to get in early or plan on waiting a little because they get packed really quickly. Not the best sushi I've ever had by any means but I don't remember a time being disappointed at the quality or freshness. They have a variety of the popular rolls people love and some originals that are great as well.
1,"My name is Gavin. I am a pho-a-holic. Let my share my story. \n\nI am a weekly regular here at Pho So1 for a reason! Having tried many pho places in LV, I keep coming back to this one for one thing...THE SOUP. This is the hands down best pho in Vegas. No questions. It's food crack, really. I just can't get enough. The broth has mystical powers and calls to me at strange times, begging for my return. The noodles and meat mingle in the bath of harmonious flavor and never fail to make me mmmmmmmm. Always order the Dac Biet #10 if you're really hungry or 14 if you're just normal. Tender brisket, delicious flank, melty chewy tendon and tripe if you want it. It's heaven in a bowl, baby. It'll cure what ails ya. Thank you Pho So1, for making me an addict.\n\nOnly words of wisdom, avoid the lunch rush on the weekend especially and order quickly.. Some days they get crazy busy and service suffers. Still, I love em to death."
1,The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.
1,"I love how there are a variety of menu options here (vs. Hot N Juicy), and their cajun sause is so unique...it's tasty and DELICIOUS!!  The service here is wonderful, as they are always upbeat, happy, polite, and care about your dining experience."
0,"Okay, they even get orders wrong as a walk in. I specifically asked for grilled chicken enchi's and she puts shredded chicken in them! Really? Next to that, customer service...horrible. Everyone in there looks so down and out, just slumming away; no smiles, speak to you very emotionless. One girl even says to a man that walks up to the counter \""ya what do you need?\"". Where is management at this place? I thought about asking to speak with a manager but seeing as how the employees are mummily (ya I made that word up) serving guests, I couldn't help but think that they are a reflection of how their management is allowing them to act, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. Such a shame the staffs personality and service doesn't match their delicious food."
1,"Missed the lunch special by a few minutes... Which in Las Vegas means it is happy hour. Great waitress, well versed in the menu. So good -- had spicy shrimp, edamame and a few other things, everyone was happy and it's cheap. I don't mean cheap by comparison - I mean CHEAP"
1,"We had this Qdoba cater a Celebration of Life for my late Aunt.  I had never heard of Qdoba - a family member suggested them and we were so happy they did.  Carla and her staff did a great job, food was yummy and the cost very reasonable to feed 25 people.  Qdoba, came and set everything up for us - food stayed hot for several hours.  It was so much better than deli meat/cheese sandwich trays.  Everybody loved it.  We will use them again."
0,"I love the location, right across the street from my gym (LVAC).  I love the almost guilt free menu options.  (Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Rockin Raspberry Smoothie this trip).  I even love the deals they have at this location like buy 2 smoothies get one free from 4-7pm and their free junior all american wrap with purchase of a smoothie from 7-10am.  \n\nThe two star rating is spawned from the seemingly intolerable drive-thru wait time and service.  On this particular trip I decided to time my experience.  36 minutes total from line entrance to smoothie acquisition.  On top of that I was charged for 3 smoothies initially despite being well within the buy 2 get 1 free time window.  As a minor aside they also neglected to ask what sort of \""side\"" I wanted with my wrap.  I guess I sounded like a Baked Sour Cream and Onion chips kind of guy?  Perhaps management needs to hire additional staff or streamline his production process?  The young man that waited on me seemed pretty stressed out."
1,"Groomingdales is a wonderful local grooming store for your pet. Robin and Sean the owners are genuine people who care about animals and will treat your pet as if it is their own. I love the environment that the animal is not kept in a cage and can have free reign of the shop while they are waiting for their turn at grooming. I also took my Chloe (yorkie) in for daycare yesterday and when I picked her up at the end of the day, she was good and tired from having a fun filled day. Stop in and chat with Robin or Sean and get to know them, you won't regret it. Lastly - their address for their shop has moved, the Yelp administrator hasn't approved the address change - they are now located on 17224 N. 43rd avenue. Less than a mile from their previous location, just right over on 43rd, just North of Bell on the west side."
1,"We came here with some friends who love this place. We're not huge huge sweet people, but I enjoyed trying it. I love the variety of flavors they have on their menu. In the last month and a half, we've been there about 2 times and have only tried 2. (Again, neither I nor my husband can really finish a whole popsicle.) \n\nThe first time we tried the limon - it's kinda like key lime pie. With half of it having the really really tart lemon taste and the other half made of graham crackers. My husband likes the tartness, but for me it was too much. I liked the \""crust\"" part. \n\nThe second time we came we tried the limon amarillo. That was very good. Very refreshing. It's not too tart. Has a good balance of sweet and tart. That's been my favorite so far. \n\nWe've always come late in the evening and it's pretty chill there. There's not a lot of seating, but has always been sufficient for the groups that we've gone with. \n\nI also like that they have free water with lime, lemon, or orange in it. \n\nWhen the weather warms up again, I'll look forward to trying some other flavors. \n\nAlso, I think the groupon deals are helpful. I'm not sure if I would come that often if I were just paying regular price. But we'll see what comes when it gets warmer!"
1,"I'm on an extended business trip and have a rental about a mile from here. I come in about every other day for very gratifying and deeply nourishing food. The people here are lovely and warm, the space is clean and bright. This is probably now my favorite place in Vegas and I'm happy to share it with you."
0,"US Today needs to have its head examined. Had a brunch buffet for $25 which featured really, compared to Bellagio and the superb Cosmopolitan, very few choices. Dry brisket and sausages. Seafood bar without seafood. Had a small cup which had a handful of gamey shrimp and crab pieces in it. Needed a big mug of green tea to wipe my mouth clean after that. Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed. Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple. Imagine that... and they didn't even have to cook it at the hotel. Forget the hype and avoid this culinary waste space."
0,Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.
0,Casears palace seems a bit overrated.ive been staying at this hotel everytime i have a family trip out here and some of the rooms are nice and some are completely horrible. The only thing that i would make me rate this place as one star is because customer service i.e valet annnnd bell boys are fucking rude. They do NOT greet customers with a smile nor do they treat you with good hospitality. Valet denied us even though we were diamond members and bell boys talked down to my dad when he was checking our bags in.bell boy even had the nerve to question why we tipped him what we did.excuse me? He doesnt even derserve a tip for how he treated us! He should be thankful we even tipped him! THANKS CAESARS FOR A HORRIBLE WELCOME AND GOODBYE!
0,"I ordered delivery from GrubHub and really regret it.  The food showed up without the drink I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but these guys chare $9 for delivery!!!! PLUS, he got his 15% tip!  For that kind of cash he should have gone to the corner store to get it.  His 'I'm sorry' cost me alot of $$$$.\n\nAnd, to top it off, threw out the food.  They put an enchilada into styro without a foil lining, so the enchilada melted the container, rendering the food inedible.  Awful customer service."
0,"Let's be honest, I was probably asking for it when I didn't bother to check Yelp before eating at this place. I got a Garlic Lime Steak Burrito Bowl and it was one of the worst things that I've had in my life. It SEVERELY lacked flavor to the point where everything kind of just tasted like a pile of mush with beans drowning all the odd flavors out. For something that's \""gourmet\"" and more expensive than chipotle I expected it to at least match it... Nope, the portions were small and the food was borderline disgusting. Garlic lime is just a sauce that they drizzle on the food...contrary to what their menu advertises. Do yourself a favor and just go eat at Einstein bros like I should have."
1,"This is actually just to let you know that Layalina has reopened a couple of blocks over, at 401 S. First St, the old Minneci's location. I did not go in, but I did see the \""Open\"" sign today, Saturday Feb. 8 2014."
1,"This place has classic choices at reasonable prices.  The service was a little spotty, but again, the food is definitely worth a visit.  My wife's family and I stopped here for a bowl of hot soup on a cold day.  Most of us ordered the delicious chicken & smoked sausage gumbo, but my wife ordered the chicken noodle soup.  The ingredients aren't of expensive quality, but the taste makes up for it.  Check this place out for sure, you won't be sorry!"
0,"Wish I could this place a negative 5.. I went in for a hair cut. Asked the stylist for a A-line haircut. Told her I didn't want it taken up too high and that I DID NOT want clippers to be used. After shampooing my hair and digging her nails in my scalp, she complained that my hair was too \""mushed\"". She started off by sectioning my hair and immediately took her shears and took WAY more than I had said.. She then tried telling me that bc my hair was missing in one spot she had to even it out.. She kept chopping and then used trimmers to by neck!!! When I specifically said NO clippers! Over all my hair is so fucked up that I can't even have a reputable shop fix it.. My only option is having extensions put in. You pay for what you get!! I will NEVR EVER recommend this place.. Not even to my worst enemy. On top of the shitty service from my stylist whom I think her name is Judy (Her station is the 4th station on the left.) the salon is a complete dump. The walls look like they're growing mold... When I asked the stylist to blow dry and style my hair she made it known that she probably wouldn't be able to do anything with my \""mushed\"" hair. And proceeded to run a fine tooth comb through my tangled hair. Honestly the worst experience I have ever had. Please do not go there. EVER! \nI would like to say that the receptionist lady up front is a very sweet lady."
0,"Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \""is that all\"". The first time she did it I said \""let me finish\"" the second time I said \""I need to speak with a manager\"" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house."
1,"From the moment I walked into the salon, I loved the vibe, the customer service was spot on, and my stylist Mattie, is AMAZING.\n\nI was going for a drastic change from light to red and Mattie did an amazing job. My color was vibrant and well done. My cut was cute and exactly what I asked for. \n\nNot only was my experience awesome but the conversation was wonderful. I would highly recommend the entire salon but especially Mattie!"
0,"This place is SO cheap - so if you're looking for inexpensive, go here!  I think it was $42 for a mani w/ gel and pedi.  My friend and I were blown away at the cost, which tempts us to return... but we wont'.\n\nWe didn't make an appointment, but they were eager to get us into a chair.  We sat with our feet in the water for a good 20 minutes before anyone was available to start with us. Not too big of a deal, but by then the water was cold and their massage chairs are NOT good. Very old... \n\nI don't like the gel/shellac polish they use. It chipped and didn't look good after about a week/week and a half (typically I can wear mine for 3-4 weeks without a chip).  My friend's color was completely see through. Our toes both turned out OK, but again they chipped completely off some of my toes by the end of week 2. I think their product is outdated - they need to upgrade!\n\nOverall, if you need a cheap mani/pedi and don't need it to last more than a week - go here."
0,"I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \n\nThe price is $35.99 per person\n\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts."
0,"Terrible terrible food, well our adventure started when our waitress brought out the coconut shrimp, terrible taste felt rubbery. Then my father asked for a well done prime rib came out medium rare. The waitress seeing disgust on our face offers to have it recooked. Wow what a waste of time and service stay away!"
1,One of my favorites! Ive been there twice and got the soft shell crab which was exceptional.  The oysters are very good too for apppetizers and so is the manhattan clam chowder. It looks very small from the outside but the restaurant is underground.
1,"Every meal I have here is good.  I love the pancakes and breakfast burrito.  The staff is very nice and helpful (love Donna Jo), the service is great and the price is right.  :)"
1,"More like 3.75 stars...rounded up because it is an experience.\n\nWhen we ate at Restaurant Charlie in May, 2008 a few months after they opened...the host told us about the Kaiseki style menu they offered next to the restaurant. We were really excited. I took my husband here for his birthday in September, 2009. We ordered the 14 courses at $250 each.\n\nThe dinner took FOUR...yes....FOUR friggin HOURS sitting on a bar stool...comfy at first hour but our backs started to ache!! I wish they offered Aeron chairs and a back massage to go with dinner. Better yet Japanese Massage Chairs to use in between courses!! Put that in the suggestion box. The timing was totally unexpected...I almost dozed off!! Seriously!! I had to leave the restaurant and walk around to stretch my legs and wake up. I don't drink much, so the beer probably made me sleepy too. We got there at 6:30 PM; first ones in the restaurant...later came a couple who didn't stay...came another couple and a group of 5 or 6. Overall, the place was 1/3 full. They ALL finished before we did!! Our dinner didn't end until 10:30PM...we were the last ones there...they close at 11pm. To Chef Hiro's and Assistant Chef Matt's credit, they apologized and gave us some desserts in a tiny box ...but the wait between some of the dishes were 15 min-30min. Towards the end it just streched out; I wanted to leave...it was not fun anymore. I was tired and uncomfortable on the bar stool.\n\nThe fun factor is watching them prep the dishes. You get about 2 bites to finish each dish. The sauces are really good (you'll want to lick the plate) but they tend to take center stage over the seafood and meats. Quite honestly, I like all the small bits around the plate better than the protein itself most of the time. Though I didn't love everything (the sardine, salmon ice cream)...they get props for being fun and inventive. My favorite was the snapper; the watermelon rind (small bits); the cute micro cucumber; avocado ice cream and spicy chocolate. Also, I can't stand foam on my food; really no point in it (foam belongs in a  cappuccino). I do like the chefs...they are friendly. Also, interesting thing...I noticed the missing teeth between the two Chefs. I wondered whether they had a pact or something or if they got into a bar fight a couple weeks before (no bruises).  It's was strangely endearing. The two obviously respect each other.\n\nThis is non-traditional kaiseki...I did like the twist..but realize I much prefer traditional kaiseki...and at this price point (our total was a little over $600 for two); the timing should be perfect and every morsel should have me wanting more (well, at least the sauces and itty bitty bits around the plate did). There are better places you can dine in at this price point.\n\nTry it here if you don't mind a 4-hour 14 course dinner. It's an experience of watching the pros do their thing in an intimate setting. The chefs are approachable and casual. I'd suggest you bring a heating pad and some biofreeze for your back. Not fun eating in discomfort.  =("
1,"The most outstanding customer service and extremely efficient wash, details, and oil changes! Anything and everything I need exceeds more than my expectations. I go to this wash at least two times a week and I leave happy every time!"
0,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We needed an inexpensive room for the weekend. Checking in was easy, staff was quick and courteous. We were told we would be staying at the Manor. The benefit to staying there was our car was close for us to use. However, you are not attached to the casino. The room was older as was the furniture. The king size bed was very new and very comfy, as were the pillows. We had a keurig for am coffee (something our friends at a higher end hotel didn't have). \nMy huge complaint is that 1 1/2hours prior to checkout our water was shut off. ( no flushing the potty, hot water to shower, washing your face/brushing your teeth). Water was returned 10 mins before we left. \nThis was not my first time in Vegas but it was the first and last time I will stay here."
1,"I will tell you before you attend to take caution to what they tell you at the box office - this is pretty much like a roast of the audience and most of what he says is going to be based on racial, gender, sexual, age or physical attributes so if you offend easily, you'll want to pass on this one.  Most of the material is new, but there were some things I had heard before like his joke about thinking about your moms lips going down on your dad next time she kisses you. In his defense I watch A LOT of comedy shows so if it's been said in a standup show on Comic View, Comedy Central, HBO or Showtime, there's a really good chance I've heard it!  Otherwise, it's a hoot! Definitely NOT for kids (rated NC-17/R).\n\nThe venue is small so it's almost like being back in high school/college, there's not really anywhere to hide just as a pre-warning.  If you attend, you are NOT off limits, so be prepared to be part of the show."
0,Absolutely the WORST club I have EVER been too. Service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity. I love going out but I will not be returning here.
1,"This is my neighborhood Discount Tire location. The staff here is always friendly and helpful, and their service is fast. The job I have is primarily mobile, so my livelihood depends on my service vehicle getting from point a to point b throughout the day and night, and I have depended on Discount Tire to help me accomplish that mission. With good warranties, good prices, and many locations, your never too far away when a tire emergency happens. The staff and management at this location always have your best interests in mind."
0,"My best friend bought her gorgeous wedding dress here. I wasn't able to be there the weekend she went dress shopping so when I came in town this weekend for her birthday she wanted to take me there so she could try it on for me. It was a Saturday and we weren't sure id they'd be busy so we called to see if they could go ahead and pull it so it would be ready for her to try on once we arrived. After calling three times, someone finally answered the phone and said sure that'd be no problem.\n\nOnce we got there no one greeted us, so we walked to the desk where two people were sitting doing absolutely nothing (one was eating). Even then neither said a word! So I spoke to tell them w had called etc and while I was explaining another employee walked by and heard me talking and asked if we called, I said yes, and she said yeh we have the dress back here, pulled, waiting for you. Great! So she takes my friend back and I sit in a chair to wait to see her in her gown. Well the lady leaves, so I have to go back and help her zip her dress, uhhh, that was a little crazy to me. I zip it, go back to the chair so I can see her walk out. She looked gorgeous in it. I asked her about veils and had she tried any on and she said no, so again I tracked someone down to help us with veils. She brings us two and then leaves.\n\nThey also sale bridesmaid dresses so we went to look at those bc shes back and forth about the color scheme she wants. No one comes to offer help with that either. Theres ANOTHER employee over there literally just straightening out the dresses, does she ask if we need any help? NO! We grabbed a couple just to see the color next to the brides dress, struggling to take pictures while holding dresses up, any help? Nope.\n\nMy gf told me they've had bad customer service throughout her entire process. She said every time they say they're going to call when somethings done, they dont. She leaves messages bc they never answer their phone and they dont call her back. And I got to see first hand how horrible it was. She, nor any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny. Horrible customer service. This is a BRIDAL boutique, soon to be brides should be doted on and made to feel special, not ignored."
1,"This is a very nice supermarket. Great prices and incredibly well organized and spacious supermarket. I have been looking for a \""Mexican\"" supermarket on this side of town, and I'm glad to say that this one is it! I will be visiting this place often."
1,"Okay, guestline/regular line is a pain. There's people in line even at 3:00 am. This place is the hottest club. Three floor, hip hop room, lounge w/ pool table, and main dance floor that's connected to the outside pool area. The crowd used to be full of prettier people when it first open, now it's a mixed. For girls, there are ways to get in for free. Do know that if you get there at 10 pm, you can expect to be in line for 2 hr and 1+ hr waiting in front because the way they make money is making you either pay extra to get in since you're at the front or leave. You'll still have an awesome time at this place. \nDaypool - It is fun. They've got the music and again, being a girl is awesome. Good looking crowd. Pretty happening place."
0,"Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale."
1,"What an awesome way to celebrate the Beatles music! This show was one big party! The 60's and Beatles lyrics inspired costumes were great, and I felt like the performers were having a fun time when they were dancing around. This show is definitely not typical acrobatics Cirque, but it was so enjoyable. In-line skating?? Only Cirque..."
0,"The prices were higher than I'm use to. The finished product was ok, not as great as the girl doing them bragged that they would be. I asked about packages for a wedding party and was impressed with the offer they have. \n\nBUT, as I was finishing up and got our my credit card I was asked by the girl (who kept taking calls while doing my nails) if I had cash for the tip. I was thrown off and asked if I couldn't put the tip on my card. She said yes but then she would have to wait for the money. \n\nFirst, the owner should pay out tips the same day that they are charged. Second, OMG beyond unprofessional and rude!!!!!! I have never in my life run into a situation like this. I had to run out to get cash and contimplated not returning, but I'm not like that. She recieved a smaller tip than she would have it I had put in on my card. \n\nNo I won't return and I'm taking the wedding party elsewhere"
1,"An amazing dinner (minus the cold greeting at the front door followed by confusion with my reservation) The BF and I were traveling with another couple and we were looking forward to this dinner.  I ordered the cookbook tasting and the remainder of the party ordered the pre-theater menu. Potatoe and leek soup amuse bouche to start...lovely with a zest of orange for tang and crisp croutons. Warm rolls are offered. accompanied by salted butter, the meal itself from start to finish was excellent in flavors and presentation-the Tuna Tartar was very fresh, some of the best tuna I have had in a long time.  Given the service and level of food I would expect to pay more, but it was very reasonable and we ordered a bottle of wine."
1,"They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount."
1,"Go for the thin crust! \n\nOverall experience was wonderful, service was attentive, straight to the point and not smothery. Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste. As a chef dining out for a casual lunch, I left pleased and with cash still in my pocket.\n\nFirst we had the Roasted Eggplant Bruschetta, the baguette was toasted to perfection. The crust was crisp with a nice light sourdough flavor and chew, not over toasted a bit and still tender on the inside. The four baguettes were topped with a beautiful creamy, tangy goat cheese. The eggplant was beautifully roasted and naturally rich in flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes added a nice acid element to this dish, which was served warm with a well balanced Balsamic Reduction. \n\nNext we tried the Smoked Chicken and Broccoli Pizza. The crust, oh gosh. THE CRUST! Perfect. Thin and crunchy, tender, caramelized in the wood burning oven to a perfect golden brown. The smoked chicken was still moist, the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor. No sauce here, just a little olive oil and garlic went down before the toppings. The Mozzarella and Smoked Provolone were appropriate, but a nice nutty Asiago or Parmesan-Reggiano would have been a welcome touch.  Bacon? Of course we added bacon! An Applewood Smoked Bacon. Although in recent years bacon, and especially Applewood Smoked has been overplayed in the culinary world, Nello's kept it organic in style. The bacon has a wonderful fatty crunch, just the right balance of salt and smoke and cooked just so. The half slabs of thick, delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking. Very pleased this bacon wasn't chopped up into tiny bits. \n\nThe Banana-Nut Bread Pudding was tempting but Tiramisu has my heart. Being half Italian I know Tiramisu and Nello's has made a great play on this classic dessert. First a thick layer of creamy mascarpone was sweetened to not over power the cheese itself. The ladyfinger layer held its integrity and wasn't soaked to the point of sogginess which is a pleasant surprise. Another generous layer of mascarpone and a surprisingly thick dusting of cocoa powder was a great touch. \n\nNello's is worth every penny, the bill for two of us was just over $30.00. We left full and happy, too many dining experiences can be disappointing if the little details are left out. They don't miss a beat! David was a fantastic server with an upbeat attitude, the rest of the staff was also attentive and helpful. Beer and Wine selection is nice as well, there is definitely something for everyone here. \n\nLike Nello's on Facebook, they post special items with fantastic seasonal ingredients that any food lover would get pumped over!  \n\nI will be back time and time again."
0,"Ugh. I was so disappointed with my experience there. The food was okay, but nothing special and definitely not worth the high price tag. However, it was the service that made me hate the place. \n\n7:40: We arrived to get dinner before our show at 9:30. We were seated at 7:44, after the hostess had to check the table chart twice for a table... there were plenty of seats.  My boyfriend commented that it may not be a good sign that the dining room wasn't busy yet only one table had food. We should have left then. \n\n7:53: Manager stops by to give us the food menu (no, the hostess did not do this) and and ask if we've decided on a drink from the drink menu (on an iPad). We told him he's the first person to stop by the table since we sat down. \n\n8ish: Waitress shows up and asks for our drink order. \n\n8:10: drinks arrive. Finally. Only good part about the whole dinner. Takes our food order. We ask that it's expedited since we have a show to get to. We were told that wouldn't be a problem.\n\n8:23: Appetizer shows up. Chicken Pot Pie bites. Nothing to write home about. \n\n8:40: Haven't seen our waitress in that past half and hour and still no dinner. There are only 6 other groups in the large dining room. We flag down another waitress who gets the manager to see where our food is. Waitress finally shows up and says that food is coming \""soon\"". \n\n8:47: Dinner FINALLY comes. I had lobster pasta. Boyfriend had the sturgeon. Both were \""eh\"". Had to scarf it down since we were in a time crunch. We ask for our check.\n\n8:55: Once more, flag down another waitress to take our check since ours is MIA... Again. \n\n9:05: Get the hell out of there and head to our show. Thankfully it's in the hotel, so we weren't late. Agreed to never, ever go to Boiler Room again."
1,Great place to sit down and enjoy great quality food. New Menu and great selections are now available. Was not too impressed with the service this time. Usually pretty good yet today was rather disappointed.
0,"I used to think Bouchon was one of the great restaurants in Vegas, but after tonight I no longer do. My party of six sent back two of our entrees: both short ribs. They were nothing but fat. We replaced one with the lamb and one with the strip steak, both of which were an improvement but still subpar for a restaurant with this reputation. The other entrees (duck, gnocchi) were just okay, but hardly memorable, and certainly not worth the cost. This restaurant better get its act together because it's not worthy of the Thomas Keller name. I won't be returning myself."
0,"Let me start by saying I love pizza. I eat it about 1-2x a week. I'll eat at the local shops and the large chains and places like Costco. I hate Little Caesar's pizza and now i hate Domino's too. I decided to give them another try on account of my mother in law giving me a $10 gift card. I tried their 3 topping carryout special and got 2 pizzas. Now I got a bunch of pizza that the trash can will eat. \n\nThe crust was gross and was over seasoned. It's kind they are hiding the lack of quality of crust with an overabundance of seasoning. The same ad a stinky teenage kid does with to much cologne / body spray. \n\nIt'll probably another 5+ years until I decide to torture my taste buds again. This was a bad choice. Do yourself and the local economy a favor and buy from one the bazzillion local pizza places, all of which will take a hundred times better than the crap I'm attempting to digest right now!"
0,"While I was waiting to see the doctor a gentleman marched in irate and said to the staff \""I decided to drive in here to get my answer since you don't return any of my calls\"" and it went on from there.  At the time I thought \""gee, that guy seems grumpy\"" until I had my own unpleasant experience with the office staff as I was leaving. I went in to establish myself as a new patient and get an annual physical which is covered by my insurance but the next thing I know they submitted it as a particular ailment and told me I owed them money!  I explained that they submitted it wrong and it should be covered and that's when the nasty staff gloves came off.  They were yelling at me, telling me they didn't have to provide me with information they provided to my insurance, didn't have to provide me with my visit information, etc.  The doctors heard this crazy conversation that the nasty office staff was having and not one of  them came out to apologize or stop the problem.  In the meanwhile the staff started hurling personal insults and being condescending to me.  I left the office in tears and got a letter a week later 'firing' me as a client (not that I was planning on ever going back).   No doctor is worth being treated like this by staff....and it made me realize why the man I saw while waiting was irate. It wasn't just me."
0,"Honest review of the food. BEWARE! \nFellow yelpers you really let me down. I have to assume that the ratings for this place are based on the drinks or pure bribery. I was in AZ so I thought it fitting to have Mexican food. This place had some of the best reviews as far as Mexican places went on yelp and I decided to check it out.\n\nThe waitress was very pleasant. and the place was pretty much empty. I showed up around 8:30PM on a Sunday in November.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nI give them kudos for the excellent music. A mix of current tunes and some 90s favorites. They also have some great TVs. Temperature wise, even with the door open, it was a tad chilly and I wore my coat. Be it known I mentioned to the hostess when I walked in it was chilly, and after no change, I let her know I was going to get my coat, which also led to no change in the temperature. Glad I had brought it. \n\nFOOD\nIt started out well. I had the chips and salsa (you get green and red) I am a sucker for green salsa, and this did not disappoint. You do need to ask for the chips and salsa if you want them. I'm not the first yelper to mention this. Would be good it the management got the hint and reminded their servers to offer it. I put a little of the red salsa (which is Hot) in with the green to give it a little more zing. The chips were excellent.\n\nSince the Tacos seemed to be all the rave on yelp (maybe because they are $1 on Tuesdays) I got the platter of 2 which comes with rice and beans. Here is what I thought:\n-Rice - bland, (ok, i know its rice, it wasn't bad rice, just not knocking my socks off. I liked that it was soft and not dry.)\n-Refried beans- also pretty unexciting, but since they were the most edible thing on my plate much of it was eaten\nTACOS Part One\n-Grilled Ono Taco - this fish taco was very dry. even adding salsa/chalula couldn't save it.  I think this taco, with the fish cooked properly could be good.\n-Carnitas  Taco - This shredded pork taco was insanely greasy and unexciting. One bite was all I could manage. The cilantro and onions were barely discernible accompaniments.\n\nSo the waitress comes over and asks how everything is. I take a deep breath and let her know about the tacos. She sweetly asks if she can get me anything else. Still feeling optimistic I go for 2 other tacos that she recommends which are popular ones during their happy hour. She walks away.\n\nA gentleman comes out and explains they are going to make me some replacement tacos and apologizes. I'm not sure who he actually was. No introduction was made. I told him I was optimistic and would definitely give it another shot. Just in the name of full disclosure, the waitress knew I was a yelper. I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out.\n\nTACOS Part Deux\nIn general, so many toppings were piled onto these two replacement tacos I think the chef was honestly trying to mask the mediocrity of the meat. (cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - Taco Bell special)\n-Shredded Beef Taco -  beef still a little dry, which can be expected. Didn't taste the green chiles it was allegedly marinated in. Unexciting\n-Tinga taco - this shredded chicken taco was ok. It was marinated in chipotle sauce but was definitely still lacking something.\n\nI have to say there was not an onion in sight within this 2nd round of tacos. I wonder if that's what was missing from the flavor. Lack of seasoning. I can't imagine this is how Southwesterners like this food. \n\nAlso, these two replacement tacos (which didn't come out with rice and beans because I said I did not require another serving) came out on a tiny plate. I need to mention that another Yelper has also complained that squeezing two tacos on a small plate is extremely unwieldy. I looked like a little kid spilling tomato and cheese all over the table. Chef - Please just plate the two tacos on a large plate.\n\nI will probably go back one more time and try a few more just to make certain I didn't just have bad luck. It seems some of the other reviewers had tacos which I did not try. If my opinion does change I will make sure to update the review.\n\n$12 with tax/tip. I had a water."
1,"Not gonna lie, I don't dream about dining in veg-only restaurants often, or ever, but with a lunch date with my vegetarian sister on the books, I figured it was a good enough reason to try the place... I have to say I was very impressed.\n\nWe chose to sit outside and it was quite nice. The handful of iron chairs and wood-top tables scattered on wooden flooring made you forget you were yards from central avenue, until a train would come through. Lots of plant life, and they had a few heaters set up. We opted for the cucumber infused water (there were other bottled options) and started on the menu. We were give one which was simply drinks, the front half is freshly made juices and juice blends (all $6 - we opted for a lemonade/agave concoction) the back is beers and wines. \n\nThe food menu is the perfect length - just enough small plates, sandwiches, salads and entrees, with lots of daily changes (bruschetta, soup of the day, buddha bowl, cheese selections). They also have the items which are vegan or can be made vegan marked with little ferns, which I thought was clever. We couldn't pick, so we decided to split four of the small plates (but the table next to us had the OM burger and it looked amazing).\n\nSquash blossom hush puppies - yummm. thank you kenny r. for the heads up. I wouldn't have known it was vegan cheese if it hadn't said so on the menu. So good, I didn't want to share. I enjoyed the onion \""butter\"", my sister did not, luckily these pups stand perfectly well on their own.\n\nThe Indian Tacos - this, as a meat lover, was hands down my favorite dish. If I hadn't know any better I would have sworn up and down with the complex flavors they brought into the chili that I was eating something heartier than beans and squash. Mixed in with the lettuce and tomato and then sandwiched between a layer of the sharp cheddar on top and fried goodness underneath, holy crap, I'm sold. \n\nThe Envious Artichoke is the perfect light dish, stuffed with spinach and olives and topped with fried onions- we were very happy campers. On the other hand, the cannelloni added some serious weight to my stomach. Granted, it's a great fall flavor concoction of goat cheese goodness served over a sweet squash puree - but not the greatest choice for our fourth tasting dish. \n\nOur service was top notch- water constantly filled, staff was very familiar with the menu, we were checked on just the right amount of times. Even though there isn't any meat on your menu, Fern, I'm a fan. (but seriously, get some new pens.)"
0,"I've been here a few times since I moved in across the street about a year ago. Usually I'm in for a pedicure and I'm out. Their pedicures are decent, nothing special but appropriately priced. I've tried other places in the area because my brow lady that practices right next door to this place says the manicurists are treated like crud. Next time I'll take that more to heart, but I was in the area and needed a pedi so I stopped in again.\n\nI recently got into the gel manicure trend. I have had a few done at other places and decided to get one while I went in for my usual pedi. My manicurist, Debbie, didn't speak to me at all, even when I tried to compliment her technique. She also gave me a massage while my hands were in her hair which I was turned off by.\n\nThe polish on my thumb chipped the next day. I know this isn't the norm for gel manicures so I went back after work. The manager at the desk listened to my complaint and attempted to fix it herself.\n\nShe didn't remove the remaining (unchipped) polish and instead tried to file the remaining polish down to my nail. She then slapped more polish on. When she was done and asked for my approval I said it looked lumpy (it's a duochrome polish so the lumpiness is enhanced) and she attempted to fix it by putting on more topcoat.\n\nMy nail is still lumpy and I will not be returning."
1,"I typically like my food non-living, but Luna's had nice, tasty, fresh options for the diner looking for a healthy bite to eat.  \n\nThe Clinton Classic Veggie Burger was quite yummy.  I love how it is hearty and grain-heavy with a little crunchy layer on the outside.  The accompanying salad was like a little work of art - I've never seen beautiful, fresh greens so artfully arranged.\n\nMy partner got the Lunasagna, which was delicious and flavorful as well.  We also shared the Incan Warrior smoothy, which I thought would be disgusting since I think hemp milk is nasty, but it was actually really good!  The raw cacao and cinnamon gave it a lot of flavor.\n\nBe warned, the cafe is quite tiny, so during a lunch hour rush it may be tricky to find seating.  The price is a bit more than you would typically shell out at a lunch spot, but the freshness and quality of the ingredients make the pricing very fair."
1,"This place had TONS of great looking food!  I ran straight to the Sushi to start, & it was slammin'!  I liked everything I ate, & it will take me a few visits to get to everything that I wanted to try.  The place was clean, all the food looked fresh, & I WILL be going back again!"
0,"The place gets 1 star for several reasons, most of all for trying to serve crap under the guise of freshly prepared tapas. One such example is their so called spanish tuna which they get from the can and afterwards add some sliced tomatoes and serve it to customers. I come from a cultural background where many of those eastern European dishes are common in our household so I know what those things ought to taste like, I cant say they were terrible but it was definitely not worth the price. Also having gone to Barcelona myself their so called jamon iberico was just another sliced up pork and nothing like the iberico from Spain. The squid stuffed with its ink came semi warm and had a nasty fish taste to it rather than what they make you believe. a combination of bad food, bad service, trying to make you believe that their food is something it's not (dishonesty) gets this place the 1 star review. It's no wonder that we were the one of two tables occupied in the whole place. Stick with firefly and your will be a lot more happier."

0,"I must say with great emphasis: brand-new restaurants simply write their own obituaries by leaving first-time customers dissatisfied.\n\nGranted, it's location ensures it's main clientele are (rich) families and really fucking old people. But I'm almost certain they won't last longer then a year or two, or further the demise of turning this into a franchise, as they're assiduously trying to do.\n\nNewly-minted Toast Cafe just opened in Ballantyne in the heart of urban planning identity-crises, \""Village at Robinson Farm\"". Having tired out the Flying Biscuit over the years (more on that later), and disgusted with the strange sushi-pizza menu at Cosmos Cafe, I eagerly hoped this would be my new breakfast/lunch place.\n\nI came here starving, and left, still starving.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n    Half Portobello Mushroom Sandwich w/ Jack Cheese & Saut\u00e9ed Onions on a Kaiser Roll and Tomato Soup - $8.99\n    Half Turkey Sandwich and Soup - $8.99\n\nThe portions were tiny. And the Portobello mushroom sand I gulped in about two bites. Here, you get exactly what you order, no flair. Which can be fine, but summoned my few mushrooms with an overload of cheese. I saw NO SIGHT of onions. Yup. And the kaiser roll was more like-- the cheapest, paper thin white bread you could find. The tomato soup was pretty boring as well.\n\nAs a chef, I have an obsessive tendency to calculate the costs of the food I'm given. I paid nearly $10 for a tiny, tiny sandwich and a bit of tomato soup - prob cost them $1.50 max to make.\n\nI left disgruntled, despite an overwhelming number of ppl asking me, \""How is the food?\"". Yup, on their website they pride themselves on having not just \""one waiter\"" per table. Which means, a barrage of different ppl asking me about the food when I'm actually not happy at all. It was boring and stupid pricey for what you get.\n\nI also HATED the \""look\"" of this place, these bland suburban paintings that aren't really paintings. Like really asinine peach and gold and beige colored things. You know, restaurant owners who open places with absolutely no creative spark. The space is huge-- but suffocated by the kind of furniture you buy at Target. The over-cosy pseudo-European shit that Europeans wouldn't actually use."
0,"Soooo, I stopped in to Zoe's on a whim this afternoon. My ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place. It isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :("
0,"Napoleon's, 2006: The Paris created an ambiance of a cool rainy April evening in France. The rain slicked streets are being lit by the warm glow from the lamps of the bistros on side streets, a beacon for  the hard working Parisian on their way home from work...everthing has a mist fractured sparkly aura...Napoleon's was an oasis of coziness with overstuffed, well used, but good quality couches and chairs. The soft tinkle of the piano in the background sets the tone for a lovely bottle of Champagne and intimate conversation with friends. Bowls of rice snacks on the tables and a complimentary nosh from the carvery welcome you to linger....\nNapoleon's, 2010: The Paris has attained that most feared patina of old tobacco smoke and thin coating of dust on the all-too obviously fake greenery...Napoleon's reminds one of an courtesan well past her prime. The few well worn slightly sticky red velvet couches are bottom-ed out, making its users resemble taco shells when sitting...they have moved the few comfortable chairs to the cold, rank cigar room...the rest of the chairs, are those you would normally find in a convention centre meeting room (perhaps from the area just around the corner?). The wine list is poor and limited; only three sparklers listed, with only one, the Tattinger, being of any quality. The red and white wines are pedestrian. The best thing they offer is the $19-$20 flight of  3 sparkers or port  which are presented in a lovely acrylic and metal carousel with a glass of soda water to cleanse the palate.  \nGone is the complimentary carvery nosh and the bowls of rice snacks. And no other food is offered for purchase, lending its patrons to loading up on the 1/2 price drink specials and then staggering out into the casino looking for sustanence, gastronomic and spiritual, elsewhere. There was no mood music from the piano (which is now covered with tacky stickers) but a gentleman playing guitar/synthesizer far too loudly for us to carry on conversation. Whereas in a previous visit, the music ranged from classical to French standards like \""La Vie en Rose\"", this was a mish mash of everything from Elvis to The Eagles. But no music to take you mentally to Paris...a shame...\nWhere once, Napoleon's was a little tender haven that encouraged its patrons to dress as do the French, with style and flair, its most recent incarnation seems content to sink down to the ultra casual, jeans and logo bearing t-shirt crowd. The sense of \""specialness\"" is lost. Might as well go to the \""Hard Rock\"" .\nYes, the economy played a factor in its decline but just because you can't dine on caviar, its doesn't mean you automatically switch to canned dog food. \nHow sad! From sophisticated to sophmoric in only three years. Truly a loss for Las Vegas...."
1,"I'm going to do a pro & con list to make it as easy as possible to lay out my thoughts about the restaurant. Consider my review more like a 3.5.\n\nBackground/Facts:\n- I've eaten at Monte more times than I can count. \n- I visit mostly for breakfast and brunch. \n- I've been to Cafe Monte several times for dinner.\n- My husband has celiac disease and cannot have any gluten.\n\nI'll do the con first so as to end on a positive note. \nCon:\n- Biggest problem is food quality consistency. I tend to find a favorite dish and order it over and over again. Doing things this way makes me aware of any changes made to the dishes (also, simply the poor execution of said dishes). So, for example, I can't help but notice when the English muffins served as part of Monte's Classic Eggs Benedict suddenly become smaller and very hard. I wonder each time I order Eggs Benedict if the poached eggs will be runny as one would expect or hard boiled. I detect when a chef uses way too much onion in the quiche Florentine, and I lament when the quiche is hopelessly soggy. Knowing that the food can be fantastic on the next visit keeps me coming to Monte. I just wish they could tighten things up when it comes to the consistency of ingredients and food/cooking quality.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful atmosphere. Sun streams in during the mornings, and the restaurant feels romantic at night. The music from French artists adds to the delightful feeling at Monte. I like the furnishing and decor choices whoever designed the space made. It hits on a lot of what Americans expect French cafe dining to feel like, but it does it without being overly Disney-fied. Also, there's usually plenty of parking close by.\n\n- Servers are always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, which is especially important when dealing with the gluten-free thing. We eat there so much, the employees know us by name or at least face.\n\n- Coffee is always great!\n\n- Great place to take out-of-town guests.\n\nSo there you have it. Cafe Monte will remain on my restaurant list in maximum rotation, but I am watching the consistency issue. I hope I am not let down."

0,Worst Customer Service I have EVER recieved in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible. We got stuck in there over 3 hours. Our server was rude. Food was mediocre.
0,"Ugh, the moment I walked into this place, I felt really awkward. We came here for our friend's surprise birthday dinner. It was about 6 o'clock on a Friday evening and as we're walking towards the door we see 2 women stumbling out completely wasted. Come on ladies, it's 6 o'clock.. what are you doing with your lives?\n\nWe walk in and the lay out is really awkward. If you've never been there and you're there for more than alcohol, it's not exactly clear what to do or how to get a waitress' attention. So we sit down and search the menu for anything without meat since it's a Friday and it is Lent. Sadly, the menu only had cheese pizza and a veggie burger. We ended up getting jalapeno poppers and a veggie burger and both were disgusting. \n \nIn addition to the disgusting meal, the patrons and the workers were grimey. Let me just break it down:\n\n(1) There are no designated smoking areas. Patrons and employees were walking around smoking around everybody. It was disgusting.\n\n(2) The crowd is a bit older... there was a lot of mid-life crisis resonating in the air. Let me just use this as an example. One of the guy's in our group paid to have a fire set up outside by our table. This old guy and his old lady dressed in dirt-biking outfits take a couple chairs and sit down right in front of me, blocking the warmth of the fire from me and my 5 month old. Thanks guy!  So the waitress goes up to the old guy and asks him what he would like to drink, and he says \"" i'm on a motorcycle, so i'll have a diet coke\"". Great to know guy... I think she asked what you wanted to drink, not what your mode of transportation was. \n       So 8 o'clock comes and the employees are letting us know of this ridiculous rule to have all children out by this time. So as were getting the kids ready, the guy in our group who paid for the fire, tons of drinks, and food says to us how he thinks it's a bad idea for business to kick people out by 8 o'clock and how he thinks they're losing money. Out of nowhere, the old guy on the cool motorcycle starts arguing with us about how he knows they're not losing money and he knows because he's been going there for 20 years. WTH? WAS ANYONE TALKING TO YOU? First of all old man, business is being lost because the man who paid for the fire you are sitting by is a millionaire and now he's never going back to this place and he's going to let all his rich friends know. Second, 8 o'clock is super early, and people don't start going out to the bars until at least 10 o'clock. Maybe people went out earlier 20 years ago, but times have changed grandpa. \n\n(3) This was a main complaint from other people in our party, but this place does not have a full bar. You'll have to settle for a beer, margarita, or sneaking in your own flask to get a good buzz.\n\n-Sorry for my rant, but this place sucked. I'm usually not picky about my food, I usually enjoy the outdoors, and I'm usually a nice person. BUT if you like second hand smoke, crappy food, rude old men, inappropriately dressed sabertooths, and a lack of good alcohol then BY ALL MEANS, check this place out."

It seems to have stuff you have never seen either, or stuff that is rare to find outside of America. There is also a fresh section as well as toiletaries, newspapers, groceries, snacks and sweets.\n\nThis may actually be a superstore after all."

My prepaid reservation seemed to confuse the desk clerk, and required her to disappear for ten minutes. Got a room in the infamous pyramid which was hot, didn't have amenities that any budget chain has these days, and cigarette smoke pervades the entire hotel. The pool area is very nice, and very popular. Not sure why the water is kept intentionally cold (was told this by an employee). Most of the other reviews will give greater detail about the buildings problems. And I would agree with most all.... I would not return to this hotel."
1,"Great food!  Nice staff, nothing fancy but down to earth, which is perfect for a bbq joint!  I usually don't mention stuff like this but thought it was strange that the decor was decent (the tables have that shiny tinge to them) but the food is served on styrofoam.  It just didn't match.\n\nBut you're not here to listen to me talk about their decor.  Hubby got the pulled pork and it was delicious.  We're from south Texas so we know pulled pork!  Well, mostly him; HE knows pulled pork.  It was so good he said it gave him heartburn!  (He doesn't usually eat to the point of getting heartburn!)\n\nI had the pork ribs, half rack ... very meaty and the sauce was AWESOME.  Wasn't as sweet as most places which I liked.  I ate my husband's potato salad because it was that good (I'm pretty picky about my potato salads).  My 13mo old daughter had a hot dog and she ate up the whole dog.  The fries were also pretty tasty!!  I didn't care much for the baked beans but I'm not really a baked beans kind of person.  I would say the baked beans were par with other places.\n\nI would definitely give this place another go ... and another.  We really felt like having bbq and didn't want to drive 45 minutes+ for it so when I found this place on Yelp, I knew I had to give it a try ... and I wasn't disappointed!"
1,"The beers they have on tap span a large spectrum. It is also cool how they have a TV specifically to show the lifespan of each keg. The only time my group goes to A&A is for their Tuesday night Geeks Who Drink Pub Quiz. \n\nEach time we come, there is a beer I haven't had before and that makes for a fun experience. Especially since I am not much help with in the random knowledge department. I'll still make my presence known with a few drinks though. \n\nThe food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate. For some this is a good sign that a hangover will not be coming. \n\nThe service staff has always been nothing but friendly. They check up rather often and give a great pep talk."
1,"This hidden gem of a brewery is a welcomed edition to the expanding Downtown district of Las Vegas.  Located next to the Heart Attack Grill on Fremont Street, this unassuming brewpub is a welcoming local spot to stop by for some amazing brews paired with some truly incredible gourmet popcorn (I love the Dill Pickle flavor).  Before you get yourself too involved with this review...you should know that Banger Brewing is a beer-only zone.  A craft brewery.  A beer bar.  Not a watering hole hammering out fruity cocktails and pouring pre-chilled shots from Jaggermeister mini-fridges.  If you're looking to drink tequila out of a stranger's belly button or drag along your 21 year old girlfriend who only drinks amaretto sours and raspberry kamikazes then this most likely isn't the place for you.  That being said...the beer is good.  Real good.  All 7 of their beers are brewed on site including options ranging from the smoothly unpretentious  American Pale Ale, \""Perfect Ten\"" (ABV 6.2%) to the rich, coffee and caramel laden \""Simply Stout\"" (ABV 6.0%).  My personal favorite is the Sandia Watermelon Wheat (ABV 5.1%).  The happy and helpful bartender assured me it's mixed with fresh watermelon to give it that crisp, clean and in-no-way-fake watermelon flavor.  The Jalapeno Hefeweizen is equally as impressive though I found myself worrying over how \""user friendly\"" this beer is to the general public.  I was shocked to hear some mixed disapproval from my beer tasting comrades.  Apparently jalapeno beer is an acquired taste like black coffee, kombucha or moldy cheese.  But what I love most about this place, aside from their top notch craft beers brewed on site, is their exceptional customer service.  Coming from a hospitality background, my radar for these sorts of things is uncontainable and even on high alert and in search of any pinprick of poor performance or inattentiveness; in the 3 hours I spent at this establishment I experienced only perfection.  The staff is professional, knowledgeable, friendly and most importantly, in love with their beer.  Smack dab in the middle of Fremont Street in the notoriously lackluster yet rocketing Downtown district of fabulous Las Vegas, Banger Brewing doesn't scream out its arrival but proudly just says, \""Hey, Vegas.  Here I am.  I hope you like my beer.\""  This place welcomes you in with a smile, an ice cold glass and a great brew to fill it.  It's like walking in to your corner neighborhood bar only with way better beer and even better service."
1,"Great customer service at this place.  Katie, our sales associate/customer rep was friendly and informed.  Our rangemaster, Jeremy, was extremely helpful and patient, and answered our numerous questions.  Excellent experience!"
1,Randomly stopped by while in Charlotte and had the best curry / hummus I have ever tasted. I wish they could ship their food to sf so I could eat it all day!
1,"Excellent pricing for quality.\n\nThe corner cabinet met my need and purpose as I am an anti-MDF person.\n\nAs I browsed the Etsy catalog, I fell in love with the gold mirror -- the right size and design.\n\nFurnitures were super duper clean and ready to use.\n\nIt took me a month to get the furnitures as I had a few mishap with shipping vendors.  Jonathan was very helpful, patient and accommodating.  Thank you!  Easy and clear communication via text and email.\n\nI hope to get more pieces from JKL as I start to fill the space of my small apartment."
1,Very nice ambiance and service is really nice. The food pretty normal although I think their babaganoush is perfect here. Not overly tangy and the meats are cooked perfectly.
1,I just had my first visit to Spoon House and I really enjoyed my experience. The owner came out from behind the counter and explained everything very well. I asked for his recommendation on what to order as it was my first time. I had the Beef Bulgogi quesadilla and I thought it was very tasty. I mentioned to the owner that I like spicy food and he brought me out a piece of the spicy pork quesadilla on the house which was also very tasty.\n\nOne reviewer mentioned they didn't have Kimchi but when I was there they had little styrofoam containers with Kimchi sitting to the right on the counter for free. I had some and also thought this was tasty as well.\n\nIt's super clean and very nice on the inside. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and will recommend it to other people.
0,"One word: EEW!  If you're not staying in a 'GO' room... Just say No! Our delux room had stains all over the carpets, furniture that was beaten and chipped, and a college dorm fridge that was warm and set on the floor randomly in our room.\nWhen we called to ask for a different room they told us 'no' and pretty much told us to leave if we didnt like it. \nThank you 'Leah', room assignments, you drove us to the Mandalay Bay where we are soooooo much happier for just $50 more!!! They are great to us here and our room isnt dark, depressing, or look like a crime scene.\nI guess 'thats what you get for waking up in Flamingo Hilton! '"
1,Ive always loved walmart for the cheap prices and convenience.  WALMART YAY!
1,"We have been My Gym members at the District for over 4 years and Jeremy is the best!  He works really hard at keeping the kids engaged and active.  Every week the class is different and exciting.  Both of my kids LOVE this place and I feel it has helped them develop very important life skills, both mentally and physically.  The environment is clean, bright and fun.  (great music)  Some people believe it's pricey, but I don't think anything in town compares to the value received.  I've tried many different clubs/classes/sports and My Gym is consistently better for the quality of instruction & fun.  My boys never nap and they leave My Gym tired. Bonus!"
0,Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.
1,"GREAT food! you know its a good vegan place when your non-veg friends like it enough to go back. everything looked and tasted delicious, packed with flavor! prices are extremely good for the quality and portions of the food. cant complain if you can leave feeling completely stuffed (i eat alot) for about $10.\n\nadvice: might want to avoid friday night dinner rush...it was pretty slammed, and my girlfriend didnt even get her drink until AFTER the meal, about 20 mins after ordering said drink."
0,"If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune."
1,"I've been to Paris a handful of times. I lived there for a summer when I was 17. Never, have I had French pastries, croissants, or bread as good outside of the city of lights. \n\nMy fiancee and I went there this morning for the first time and were blown away. We ordered a quiche, a loaf of rye bread, a butter croissant, a pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant), and  a pain au raisin, (a pastry with raisins...my favorite). Each was delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy (like it should be). The croissants were filled with enough butter to make them melt in your mouth. And the bread (which we tried at home) was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and delicious all around.\n\nI can't express how excited I am that we now have an authentic and outstanding French bakery in Pittsburgh. If only it were in Squirrel HIll (where I live) and not in Lawrenceville. I guess we'll have to make more trips out that way!"
1,Amazing company! The best one in Vegas!
0,WARNING:  This nightclub contains bass known to the State of California to cause pace-maker interruption and exacerbation of high blood pressure or other cardiac harm.\n\nLiterally the thudding hurt my otherwise healthy ticker and made me crave the nearest exit. Or maybe it was the seizure inducing flashing lights that would periodically come up to full power for 5 seconds revealing exactly how unattractive those around me were. Or the fact that these momentary flashes also provided me with a glimpse of the space - a huge dirty industrial warehouse. \n\nThe music was decent but enjoyment was truly interrupted by concern for my heart falling out of my chest cavity...if you can imagine.
0,So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back
0,"Oh God, coming here was a waste of time, money, and caloric intake. I wasn't nearly drunk enough to warrant the food. They have cheap late night specials, but I think I'd rather haul my ass to Ellis Island for their food!\n\nService was SOOOOO slow.\n\nNot only was service terrible, the food was even worse. We ordered several things. My boyfriend's dad ordered a soup from the Chinese menu. This dish was bearable. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs from the breakfast menu. It came with hash browns, biscuit, and toast. The country fried steak was TERRIBLE. It felt like the batter was made of eggs and flour and the meat was tough as well. I ordered the eggs poached, but they were completely overcooked. The worst poached eggs I've had, worse than those cooked in bulk at breakfast buffets. I ended up eating mostly biscuit and toast with jam and butter. The gravy itself was really good. The only highlight of the meal.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were horrible. I don't even know what to say... He also ordered the steak meal and ordered it medium rare, as usual. The meat came back closer to a well done. It was terrible. \n\nOverall, I wish I could turn back time and just eat at the Big Sur Oyster Bar next door."
1,I have to say I found Grinders on yelp and I tried it because of the great reviews and all I have to say is they were right:-). The food was awesome the staff was so friendly I felt like I was a regular the way they all conversed with me I will be back I got a pizza and the cheeseburger sub incredible my friends loved it too.  Thx you grinders see u soon.  Steve from Southwest Airlines
0,"(Our group's reservation was made a comfortable two days before our visit) \nThe evening was already soured when our hostess rudely broke her centimeter-thick temper. Our group of five asked to be seated in the main restaurant, and not the small, triangle room completely separated and across the hotel hallway. The hostess then told us that they only have two tables in the entire restaurant that can accommodate 5 people. We were then seated in \""the wine cellar\"" beneath the hotel escalators. First encounter with a restaurant should not be a poor mannered hostess. Ambience was off putting as music choice was loud and inappropriate for an Italian steakhouse that only offers very few bottles of red wine under $200. \n\nHowever-\n\nOur waiter and sommelier were very kind and very knowledgable of the menu and wine list. Major props to them- when asked about wine pairings for a crab and white truffle sformato, they were able to offer great, educated choices (we ended up pairing the dish with a heavy Chardonnay which, though wildly overpriced, worked well). Other notes on the food:\n\n(Everything was overpriced- so I won't mention it in every description)\n\nPorterhouse Steak (MR): not sure what happened here, the cut more resembled venison as it tasted unusually gamy. \n\nFilet Mignon (MR): my order- very tasty, great portion, well cooked, and cut like butter. \n\n\nBeet Carpaccio: lots of flavors, fun presentation, very light, very small portion. \n\nPastas: we ordered two pastas which were both relatively underwhelming, though very fresh- mostly poor meal pairing on our part I suppose?\n\nDesserts: light and tasty, no flavor complaints.\n\nIn general- everything was very harsh on the palate, which made building our meal in three-course form, as the restaurant suggested, difficult. There were some pleasant notes in the evening, but overall we were underwhelmed and unimpressed."
1,"The hubs and I are suckers for some good Pho and we haven't found better in Phoenix since we moved here. The restaurant itself is nothing special but what does one expect when you can get two bowls of pho, two drinks, and crispy spring rolls for under $15? We've never eaten anything else there but in the cooler months we eat here at least 3 times a month... sometimes more =)"
1,"I live close to the greenway half moon and loved this place so my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to try to other location, heard they had different food and different interior. \n\nWe sat at the bar, I ordered some wings (cant get enough of half moons wings) and my fianc\u00e9 ordered a burger and a side of wings.\nWINGS WERE PERFECT.\nMy fianc\u00e9 didn't like the bun as much on the burger but it was still pretty good.\n\nI really like the change up of this bar, I loved the environment and the way everything flows.\n\nThe best part about this visit was probably the bartender, her name was Alexandra.\nBecause of her my fianc\u00e9 and I stayed at least an hour past the time we intended on leaving. She did a damn good job getting my fianc\u00e9 drunk and we had a blast with her. \nVery outgoing girl and the customers around me seemed to think the same.\n\nWe will 100% be back on a regular basis!"
1,"Can you say delicious? Everything, from the salsa choices and the guac, to the street tacos (we had the all pastor) and all the entrees was amazing. And then there was the flan. I'm picky about that. Creamy, rich, smooth, and obviously carefully and freshly made. And churros too! The drinks were pretty fabulous, and worth the price. We'll be back for sure."
0,"Overrated.  Went here for dinner on 10/30/13.\n\nI had a few things, including the mushroom tart - tart was cold, but mushrooms were warm.  When food is not served at the right temperature, then I'm over it.\n\nThe garlic cream cheese stuffed peppers sounded better on paper than they did on the plate.  The cream cheese completely separates from the pepper when you cut into it.  No bueno!\n\nThe best part of my meal is the garlic bread and sweet butter.  That was good!\n\nRestaurant is dark and very large.  Self-parking in the back.  I was put off by the large number of kitchen workers taking their break outside of the restaurant that backs into the parking.  I also didn't like seeing the numerous servers inside the restaurant all chatting with one another waiting for something to do."

1,After seeing the outrageous prices at another clinic we made an appointment here at Topaz. This clinic is fast and extremely friendly. Every staff member here complimented our cat and was very patient and it was easy to see that they are all animal lovers. At the end of the appointment we were very happy with the price too; 25$ off for new patients! We will definitely come here from now on and make this recommendation to our friends as well.
1,"Ambiance: plenty of seating & cozy.. was not crowded the 2 times I went\n\nService: Barista is a sweet, polite young lady\n\nCoffee: chai latte is DELICIOUS-- perfectly sweet... esp good with the white chocolate gingerbread biscotti.. gingerbread latte isn't as great"
0,"I have tried this place about 6-8 times since moving here in 2002 because others rave about it, and I keep thinking it will be different but every time I seem to get something bland. Ordered some sort of peanut-spicy chicken thing and it was basically flavorless and the onions were raw. Are they in a hurry or something? \""Chicken\"" tasted thin and rubbery. Place was SUPER noisy - do NOT go on a date there! Ling and Loiue's on Shea and 96th blows this place out of the water in every category."
1,"We went here today to get a new windshield for my Nissan Xterra (fix it ticket ick). And honestly I was not looking forward to the pain my pocketbook was going to be feeling from this one (once we asked ourselves if paying the ticket would be cheaper than the windshield- HA) But honestly, United had the best price quote of anyone in the city and that's why I chose them. The side benefit from selecting them was that there was no wait for us this morning (we got in at almost 9am) and they were super friendly and all around excellent to deal with."
0,"I hate this place.  Why is ok to degrade Buddhist statues but never say a word about the virgin mary.  I am offended at the cultural appropriation and not to mention their billboards make me sick.  I love sex and I love love Vegas, but keep my religion out of it!\n\nThe food also is not that good, nor the cocktails.  If you are from CA, try the Geisha House in Hollywood.  It is amuch classier version."
0,"The best thing about this meal was the view.  Because we had a voucher, we (along with many others) were put in a separate room with the tables and chairs they use for their events (weddings, etc).  It was a very limited menu and small portions.  The food was average at best, not super flavorful.  Our waiter was nice and the service was good....maybe a tad too quick.  We were thinking it was like the food was prepared like it was for catering and plates were made it advance.  The atmosphere was nice but I'm pretty sure we are not going back."
1,I love this place. I used to go to 99 Ranch Supermarket but stumbled upon this place. The aisles are more wider so i don't have to worry about bumping into other carts. It's not as crazy and jam packed as 99 Ranch and the staff is definitely more nicer and helpful too. I love coming here for Asian products. I even bought my first shabu pot and gas grill along with all the goodies to eat with it. They have everything you can imagine for Asian cooking.
0,I really want my daughter to be seen by a doctor and not by a pa. I have taken my daughter to them about 5-6 times this year and every time my daughter has been seen by a PA. I can't wait to change insurance so I don't have to have dr lamott as my child's doctor whom I have not met yet since January.
1,Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction
1,"Five stars based on the food we had! -- BBQ half duck, Pepper beef and walnut shrimp. Everything tasted fresh and yummy. House was packed. Menu was huge. Prices reasonable for the quality and quantity. We will definitely dine here again!\n\nService is another story, about 3 stars-- but go for the food, not the service!"
0,"I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \""THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\""  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\"".  That was his solution.  \n\nSo in a nutshell:\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \n\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair."
1,We went there for a second time in 4 nights!  We ordered salads and drinks.  The service is really good.  All the servers show you that they care.  \nWe were there really late (close to midnight) and one of the servers was putting the table setting on a table in the corner in the back and he was singing while doing it.  It was so adorable!  It seemed that he was enjoying what he was doing.  It somehow made me feel better about the place and the environment there.  I'll definitely go back and I totally recommend dining there for some fine Mexican dining.
1,"Had a chance to try the crustless quiche today - works for gluten free. It had a good flavor, not over cooked and fresh ingredients. They are working on a gluten free crust for the pot pies and quiches. The meatless one today hit the stop. I'll try them again."
0,"It really takes a lot to agitate me and yet the girl(s) at Rebel Oil #66 on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo managed to do just that.  I went in for gas.  The card reader at the pump was not working so I went in to pay for my gas.  There are two girls standing behind the counter talking ane one doing some type of inventory in front of the counter.  They ignore me for nearly 3 minutes.  Now you may be saying,,, \""Come on, its only three minutes\"" but when you are the only one other than the three of them standing there it seems like an eternity.  No \""Hello\"", \""I will be right with you\"" Nothing.  They just kept talking to each other and refused to acknowledge me until I cleared my throat.  All I got was a look.  No greeting, no inquiry, no nothing she just gave me the \""What do you want?\"" look.  So I ask for my gas, she rings it in and I walk back to my car.  No salutation,,,, nothing,  Just the look of irratation that I had interupted her morning coffee conversation with her coworker.  I am sure it was important and had something to do with cold fusion, world peace, molecular chemistry or something like that.  (Insert sarcasm here).  I get to the pump and low and behold.... nothing.  The pump wont turn on.  I go back in.  Still no inquiry what so ever so I say. \""I am not getting anything on the pump\"".  She goes over to the register and a few seconds later spouts out  \""Ok, go ahead\"".  Wow, she actually does speak.  Back to the pump.  Same problem.  I go back in.  I ask if they can just change my pump number.  She says \""Did you hit the green button?\""  (No, dumbass, you did not tell me I had to hit the freaking green button.) Since fairness is always in order this time I did not say anything I just turned around and walked back to the pump.  I finally get my gas and as I pull out the first thing in my mind is I am going to rip this joint on Yelp!  \nYou would think that with the hundreds of gas stations around (a lot with cheaper gas), the people working in them would make at least a tiny effort to be polite and friendly.  I guess Rebel Oil #66 on Decatur and Flamingo does not think that is necessary.  \n\nJoin my quest and get your gas somewhere else please."
1,"This place has some wonderful food! The Arepas are filled with crispy pork and the sauces that comes with them are delicious! I love the spicy sauce, I think it may have habaneros in it, it burned my lips in a good way! Then I was cooled off with the avocado cream sauce. The chicken was beyond delicious. Don't forget to try the ribs, I mean fall off the bone. Oh, I almost forgot the plantains were like little sweets fried pockets. I love the cheese Empanadas and the Tequenos (fried cheese sticks) my daughter said next time we need a dozen. I will be back for sure!"
0,"Average bar food topped with awful service. I go almost weekly during college football season because it's a central location to meet friends and watch the game. I haven't bothered to review this place in the past because it is what it is and I don't have any misconceptions about it. A recent visit, however, prevents me from keeping quiet.\n\nOur group visited during March Madness to watch hoops. Gotta be true to your school and all. Even though the staff KNEW we were all there to watch the game, they seated us in a spot that required our group to move at halftime so they could get the dance floor going.\n\nOur server completely forgot the wife and I after the half. Two other servers stopped by to see if we needed anything, but they  told us they couldn't help us because we already had a tab open with someone else. They didn't bother to tell OUR waitress that we were looking for her, though.\n\nOur server finally stopped by--with our check--as the game was ending. When I asked where she'd been for 90 minutes and told her I'd tried hand signals and even tapped her elbow as she rushed away from the next table, she told me I should've yelled at her to get her attention. Um, I'm sorry, aren't you a SERVER? Don't you provide SERVICE?\n\nWhen I spoke to the manager, he didn't seem concerned that his server was a twit and her co-workers had left her flapping in the breeze instead of telling her one of her tables wanted something. He did offer to comp the tab, but I drank my beers and ate my food, and all I wanted was acknowledgement that his crew had done a poor job and assurance that this wasn't what they aspired to.\n\nIf you're going to do a shitty job, fine. But don't argue with me when I call you out on it and then suggest that it's MY fault because I didn't tackle you so I could spend more money at YOUR place."
0,"I ordered an item (pizza oven) to be delivered Dec. 24th as a gift and it finally showed up  Jan. 5th and it is broken .They said they could deliver a new one in one week, January 16th too late for the party December 25th, January 1st, January 8th,January 15th, the national college championship game.No one should buy anything from them and expect to receive it in working order when you may need it. They will not assist you with a return, you are on your own.Go ahead,buy your wife a gift and piss her off!!! This review is for the online store only ,the people at the Biltmore store are wonderful and extremely helpful."

0,"The massage was great for $20/hr. really thorough and relaxing. But the payment process was a little awkward... I came with a group of 7 girls and afterwards the masseuse people chased us for more tip... We tipped $5-$10 each and apparently they wanted more and stood in our way until we gave them more... \n\nI thought tip was optional, but apparently here, they'll forbid you to leave until they're satisfied with the amount you give them."
0,"Sorry to buck the trend of good reviews as I do agree that the food is yummy and I really want to like this place BUT......\n\nI've been here twice now and the service has been poor-grim. The first time was a sunny spring day when some friends and I popped in for brunch. Yes, I was a little late arriving but we waited an age for the coffees they had ordered and then even longer to for the waiter to take our order. 30mins later (over an hour since we had sat down) we were informed they were no longer doing brunch (even though the same ingredients are on the lunch menu). The manager came and apologised, we had yummy lunch in the sun. Ok, so they're just having a busy shift and training new staff. I'd still come back.\n\nNope - months later a friend and I decide to try again for a quick brunch. We ordered at the counter before we sat down as we were pressed for time, and turned to feel a few angry eyes from tables who had obviously been waiting a while. Uh oh! Coffees again took an age, despite the staff having no urgency about them at all. They had run out of rolls for my friend's sausage roll so would she take toast? She asked if they had brown bread, answer was 'We have all kinds.     Do you want toast?'. It was all just a bit less pleasant than a weekend brunch should be. I won't be hurrying back to give them a 3rd chance!"
0,"Wow, a lot changes in 5 months. I gave 5 stars back then but with this new ownership, not this time.\n\nOrder my usual and was told it would be 20 to 25 minutes. So I headed over at 30 minutes and was told by (Darrin I think) said that my order just came out and he'll go get it. So I waited 10 more minutes while he and a driver were chit chatting in the kitchen to get me slice and cheese sticks. When he finally handed my order to me, he offered no apology.\n\nOnce I got back to my office the order was not correct and the slice was cold. I gave them a call and Darrin tells me he's the manager, so I told him the problem. Again no apology, he just starts whining about being the only person back there with 4 orders. I explained to him getting a slice out to a waiting customer makes sense since they cool off faster than a full sized pizza. This clown goes on to tell me how difficult it is to work back there by himself and I must never have worked in the food industry before.... well, jackass, yes I have, for many years and I learned two things- how to prioritize and how to offer great customer service. \n\nSo in trying to find a real manager to speak with I called the Val Vista store, the young ladies there had no idea what to do so they told me to call Nicole back at 5. \n\nTo the owners of these franchise locations- you need to do some in depth training of your staff on a variety of issues."
0,"I just got Shanghai'ed for an extra star!  The inside was immaculate and dare I say pretty?\n\nThat's about it.  It's basically an upper scale PF Chang's with Panda Express food.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy me some Panda Express from time to time, but I pay Panda Express money.  If I'm forking this amount cash in this place, the food better have been dummy-waitered from the city of Shanghai.  I want to be able to taste the sweat that dripped off the cooks forehead from Shanghai in my dish.  Not really, but you know what I mean.  I don't think I was even full after the meal."
0,"If I weren't held hostage at hockey lessons twice a week, I'd NEVER eat at 18 Degrees. The staff is friendly but food is very mediocre and overpriced for the taste...and I've been coming here for years so I've tried just about everything. The wings, if ordered well done, and the mac & cheese are good though. No complaints about Over Easy."
1,"Just want to say off the bat that in no way am I affiliated with Shane Co or getting kickbacks from them. Just writing an honest review on my experience there recently.\n\n1) Overall/ Intro\n2) Sales reps\n3) Selection process\n4) Price negotiation\n5) Conclusion\n\n1) The staff was very comforting and professional. I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked.  It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE."
1,"Nice, friendly staff. Of course, we had met them first during our bachelorette party festivities at Ghost Bar.  What's not to love about single gals? ;p That's how they reeled us in. (Yes, we're suckers) Who cares they were fun and nice guys and I am a single woman in Sin City.\n\nPretty yummy food not necessarily the best Japanese food but tasty. On the pricey side though. Enjoy the Tokyo Cooler. I'm not much a drinker but I'll drink this and it was on the house. It soooo pays to a bachelorette in Viva Lost Wages. \n\nGreat view. And they know to treat repeat customers. \n\nSo is Kenji, the cute HAPA manager, on the menu? haha"
0,"I have had this in my \""to try\"" list for a long time... not really long enough :(\n\nI stopped in for a lunch special...2 slices and a drink for like $4.00 or so... BUT they only accept debit over $5.00 Then make the damn special $5 bucks! I had to add a third slice just so I could eat there. LAME\n\nThe pizza was thin, no sauce and topped nice with cheese. The entire thing was flavorless. NONE not the sauce or the crust. \n\nThe service was all over the place (not in a good way) the building was roasting hot, and there was an old guy with his Pee Bag hanging out there while eating. (no stars deducted for that)\n\nOver all... I doubt I would be back."
0,"Let's just say it how it is, steak and lobster price for happy hour portions! And the drinks........psh! Forget about it! 15 bucks a drink was wayyyyyyy too much! They better hope I am drunk if they ever expect me to pay those prices again! \n\nOur waitress was not helpful nor was she ever really acknowledging our existance and when it came time to pay she took forever to come to the table with our bill then took another maybe close to 10 minutes before she came back with our card! After our meal we were still hungry and we had to run to In-N-Out just to feel a little more satisfied!"
1,"Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong."
1,"This secret pizza place is hidden on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. To find out the exact location just ask one of the hosts at one of the surrounding restaurants. Gyuup only cool people know where this is located :P. \n\nI was Ice skating at the Boulevard Rink and decided to grab a bite to eat, was starving! I ordered a meat lover's pizza for $5 bucks a slice, The slices are pretty huge and I love how the crust is so crusty loaded with garlic.. The pizza was awesome customer service was great, it was a quick in and out kinda pizza joint. The only thing i did not like about this place was if it gets too crowded in their people will be all up in your space! :P overall enjoyed my experience."
1,Stopped by Marquee for the Armin Van Buuren concert during EDC weekend and it was extremely nice. The stage area and dance floor is rather small but the light show and effects really make up for it if you can find your way out there. Overall I definitely much preferred Marquee over Tryst and Surrender.
1,Excellent place to cab to if staying on the strip (about $7 from the Bellagio)  Cab service back to our hotel was a breeze as well.  The service was polite and attentive.  Their famous Prime Rib is always excellently prepared and the side dishes are on par. \n\nIt was so easy to make reservations on Open Table especially in a crazy city like Vegas.  We were seated right away and finished dinner with more than enough time to catch our show.
0,"It was my first time at TAO beach and I must admit, I was VERY disappointed! The music that they played wasn't as hyped up as it was supposed to be, it smelled like poo the whole entire time, and there weren't a lot of good looking people around! A lot of people there looked like hot messes; it's definitely something you see straight out of Jersey Shore! Plus, the pool is so small; I am a tiny girl and even I had a hard time trying to squeeze in!\n\nHowever, regardless of TAO beach, what I can tell you fellow Yelpers is to check pool/tanning area outside TAO. People out there are much more friendly, compared to TAO beach, and plus it's more classier! If you are the type that wished that they were a part of the TAO beach party because of the loud hype, you can certainly still party out in the pool area if you are tipsy because it's VEGAS."
0,"I've been coming here for years with good to great service and great food. Today me and some good regulars left Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop with some SALTY ASS BALLS. YES... SALTY ASS BALLS.  There was definitely some miscommunication going on and we came up with the short end of the stick. \n\n\""Don\"", our waiter takes our order. We would like the Famous Prime Rib. \""We are TOTALLY OUT of prime rib\"". That statement says that there is no more in the vicinity. Weird because how can they be totally out when it is only lunch?  We order beef ribs, the surf and turf, and steak and eggs.  Less than 5 minutes later, the salads come out and the gentleman next to me orders the thick cut prime rib from our waiter, Don.  Interesting... \n\nWe get told after inquiring that the prime rib was not ready when we ordered it a few minutes ago, but IT'S READY NOW BITCHES!!!\n\nWe felt like we got bamboozled and the management wouldn't do anything to set things right. Don looked at his times on his receipts and said that the couple ordered it a good fifteen minutes after our orders. No sir, you typed that order in much later from when you actually \""took\"" their orders.   However long it takes to bring in a salad was when you took their orders Don.  It wasn't 15 minutes. At least your late ass ticket gets to cover your ass. \n\nIn the end, the management would not make things right with their paying regulars. Management gives us a comment card. PASHAAAAAAH!!!???!!!  I'm giving a very low rate because of the management. The food is great here. It really is. The \""waitresses\"" and \""bussers\"" are great  here too. Don is new and has RUINED our eating experience at one of our favorite lunch eateries. I'm going to miss this place..."
0,"This place is the worst. No appointment needed to get service, but expect your car to be there for a full day.  Took my car at 7:30am and they don't call me until 4pm.  Wait! I had to call them to find out what is going on and they haven't even started to work on my car. Either they are understaffed or don't know how to work efficiently. Won't be taking my car there ever again.   Just stay away or go there and enjoy the frustration, your choice."
0,"This airport is indeed one of my favorites and I normally stop in at the news shops, but this one was a huge let down.\n\nThe staff were not friendly at all and it got worse when I didn't make a donation to whatever they were collecting for at the moment.\n\nThe selection was ok, but there were no decent hats, which is what I typically pick up!\n\nThankfully there are plenty of other places to look around in while you are waiting on your plane!"
0,"Located on the 5th floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel, Quesadilla looks like a mix between a Chili's and Acapulco except it has much lower quality food and lacks their own bar. They have to share with 2 other restaurants.\n\nFood: 1/5 stars\nThe carne asada and carnitas meat were both dry and tasted like cardboard. The rice was bland and I think the only reason they added it to the plate was to take up room on the plate as well as your stomach if you can tolerate the taste.  If they're going to serve dry food, they should have the courtesy of giving us refills on our waters.\n\nService: 3/5 stars\nNothing spectacular. They weren't really friendly and didn't check on us."
1,"When I first came here I was amazed by how much food they were serving. It is a usual buffet so you can go and pick out which food you want to eat. They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices are very reasonable. I have been here 3 or 4 times already and I have not regretted one of them."
1,"This place is pretty neat. The brews are decent, the staff is amazing, and the vibe is low-key. I always have a pretty decent time here and I love the watermelon ale. \n\nI wish they stayed open later (they close at 7 most nights apart from special events). Also, it is always HOT inside. Maybe upgrade the AC unit? \n\nThey don't do food here and that's a shame. However, the staff frequently arrange for a delicious food truck to hang out in the parking lot which helps quite a bit."
1,"My best friend and I visited Zinburger on a week night and found it to be fairly busy.  Although we could have gotten a table (with no wait) we opted to sit at the bar facing into the restaurant.  Wonderful design element.  We had an excellent view of what was going on and both agreed that the layout and design was excellent.\n\nThe food was expensive but it was very good.  We split a kobe burger, double truffle fries, zucchini fries and a bottle of wine.  I was definitely just the right amount of full and left feeling wonderful (maybe that was due to the wine?).  \n\nI'll be back to splurge.  This place was splendid."
0,Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.
0,"Once when I was on a nonstop flight from Salt Lake to Washington DC, in lieu of all the reading material I had brought with me, I ended up getting sucked into a marathon viewing of Tabatha's Salon Takeover on Bravo.  After four and a half hours of salon/employee improvement and makeover \""reality\"" TV I can say that this nail salon could definitely stand some Tabatha type attention.  \n   It wasn't as awful as some of the previous reviews, the lady who did my nails was quiet and seemed to stay generally focused - aside from having to answer the phone every time it rang.  I didn't wait very long before she started on my pedicure and she listened to what I wanted (just filing my nails - no clipping.)  The massage chairs work on the bottom and back; there's a lot going on there if you want it, or you can adjust using the controls.  She did a fine job on my toes.  \n   My major complaint comes as we moved over to the manicure.  The tables were gross!!  I wanted to ask for a sponge and some lysol to start cleaning myself.  The manicure tables were dirty and small.  Another customer commented on the cramped space and someone mentioned that they would be getting new tables soon.  I can only hope that someone might be bothered to keep the layer of grime off the new ones, but I doubt it. \n   Grand total for the experience was $55 for the mani-pedi.  It was passable, but they could be doing a lot better.  Improve the customer interaction, and clean up!  Next time I'm in Vegas I'll find somewhere else to get my nails done."
1,"A good restaurant deserving of at least 4 stars and the potential to earn 5. \n\nWent there with my fiance for dinner.  We had the portobello sandwich ($11) and the green chili pasta with salmon ($19).   The sandwich was good, everything tasted fresh, but nothing \""special\"" about it to warrant 5 stars.  It came with a side and we chose the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was actually phenomenal, not too heavy with cheese, but had a perfect amount of bread crumbs giving it a nice crunch.  \n\nThe green chille pasta tasted great...for the first few bits...then good for the next few bites....then edible for the next few bites...and then at the end I just felt like a pig.  Not used to eating cream based pasta.  This would be great as an appetizer for the table to split, but too heavy for me to eat for a meal.  The piece of salmon that came on top was thick and definitely a generous portion.  However, it was a bit pink on the inside (we ate it anyway, too hungry to send it back).  Nevertheless, still tasty.  The menu said that the pasta dish came with tomato bruschetta, but the waitress did not bring any bruschetta.  So, I asked her for bread and she did bring a french baguette which was good, although the bruschetta probably would have gone better with the meal.\n\nWill definitely be back to try some other items on their menu that are a little less heavy than the pasta."
0,"I'm still undecided if I like this place. Yes it's all women but it's not very personal. I feel like one of many here. You don't really see the same Dr., Nurse, or PA here. They also have mammography now in office and it wasn't very professional. Took me forever to get my results. I had to call and get them. It was in a tiny room in the back, like they converted a closet! I'm going back to SMIL for my mammograms. Still unsure if I'll stay at Valley a women for Women."
0,"I'm new to the area and had a friend visiting from out of state so we decided to try out some bars on Mill. Clearly we walked into the wrong bar. I don't know if we didn't fit the look they like to have there (trashy......?) or what? Maybe we were dressed a little too nice or something. We sat down at the bar and were ignored for a good 10 minutes and then we each ordered a Long Island. The guy comes back with our drinks in those big, red, plastic coca-cola water cups... With what tasted like pure soda. $9 sodas. Really?! And not a single other person had drinks in those giant water cups. Who serves a Long Island in a coca-cola water cup??? Stupid bartenders I guess. We asked if he could make it stronger and he rambled something about it being some percentage alcohol and then walked away. We were about to just walk out when he came over and poured a \""Long Island mix\"" into the cup. They don't even know how to make a real Long Island. Anyway, it tasted terrible although slightly stronger so we drank half of them and walked out. Will never return."
0,"Definitely not one of the best happy hours I've had unfortunately... =/\n\nMy co workers wanted to come here for happy hour since it's right down the street from our office. I never even knew it was here since  the location is not great at all. It is not close to the main intersection but close to the back street instead. When you first walk in, it's sooooo dark in there! I almost felt like I needed to turn on the flashlight on my phone to see. lol. \n\nI think the happy hour drink specials were not that bad. $2.50 for wells and wine and certain beers. I got the Pinot Grigio wine. Obviously this place isn't a wine bar so it wasn't that great. We ordered some appetizers as well. The nachos were a fail. =/ It was that type of cheese that wasn't necessarily melted on there but just straight up dry and stuck together on the chips. The wings were ok as well. My co workers ordered the spicy ones. I'm a total wuss and can't handle spicy at all but these were actually not even spicy. \n\nI guess this was an ok place to hang out. I like that they also have pool tables and air hockey to keep you occupied I guess while you're waiting for your food. Because our service was extremely slow. I probably won't be coming back unless the co workers wanted to or for some $2.50 drinks. =P"
1,"Had dinner here with my husband and mom and sister visiting from out of town.\n\nAs a starter I ordered the salad with a goat cheese strudel and herb vinaigrette. The dressing and strudel were excellent.  For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.\n\nHave since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had. Again, our meal was very good, and certainly by C-U standards, great.... but I still wouldn't say the meal was exceptional."
0,"Arrival at this place found no customers there at 11:15 a.m., yet, we were asked if we had a reservation!  Really?  Will they be needed? \nI cannot excuse an empty restaurant that is slow to take a drink order!  Then our drinks (soda and water) arrived almost at the same time our meal arrived! \nI am a (non-fat) vegetarian, and there was little/no options--salads all had some kind of meat.  I opted for the \""special\"" -- penna pasta with meatballs and asked for the meatballs to be packed to go, NO Parmesan on pasta.  My whole order came packed to go, fortunately the meatballs separate from the pasta.  I said I would eat it as is, but the host/manager(?) insisted he take it back.  He did.  It came back COVERED in parmesan, and he ran so fast I couldn't stop him to take it away.  Finally our waitress returned and took it back but complained to me that it was not her fault she had it written.  Somewhat apologetic.  The sauce was good.  No bread???  I did not ask for any, but thought a pasta dish should have some kind of bread along with it.  \nI truly do not get the Pittsburgh accent here.  I was born and raised in the 'burgh, but really do not like when people \""write\"" in Pittsburghese....  the menu turned me OFF.  But even worse than the Pittsburghese was the lack of local favorites!  The menu should be flooded with pierogies, kielbasa, bologna, Isaly's chipped ham!  Come on!  Why name it Dahn Tahn and have nothing representative of Pittsburgh??\nThe decor is 50 -60's sock hop kind of thing.  Where is Pittsburgh in that?  I think they could do better.....\nSlightly high priced for offerings. \nService was mediocre, food was mediocre. (saw a review about their sweet potato burger, perhaps I will try again???)"
1,"Overall,  good buffet selection.  Went there on Valentine's day craving for some seafood buffet.  They served complimentary champagne and unlimited lobster claws that night. The line was long but it was  worth the wait.  Asian dishes could be improved, I think."

Kid's Kastle will ensure that your daughter expects to wear only $20 dollar fake rhinestone emblazoned headbands, $60 dollar tutus, or carry around her very own $100 dollar Hello Kitty suitcase. You can even buy her a set of press on nails that would make a Vegas stripper proud for around $15 bucks. I ensure you they will AT LEAST last until you make it out the Forum Shops!"
1,I actually love the BX because it is huge and has many things. Since my parents are able to access the base I love to come to the BX. It has a variety of things to sell. This place reminds me of a huge department store in a mall.\nThis place is awesome so I give it 4 stars.\n\nAlso it has a huge food court and the best part is that there are NO TAXES.
1,I have to say that I own a carpet cleaning company and have worked with a bunch of other movers in the valley and there is no other company like Just-In Time Moving. Justin and his crews are outstanding. I have referred him to many of my customers and they have always called back with utter amazement at just how professional and courteous Justin and his crews have been. How reasonable and hardworking they are and it is always nice to know that you can refer someone like Just-In Time Moving & Delivery to your customers without being worried about being embarrassed. Also the customers Justin has referred to me have had nothing but good things to say about Just-In Time Moving and I am not surprised how many have used his service a number of times. Great Job Just-In Time Moving & Delivery.
0,Had an issue returning an item I got for Christmas. The same one was sitting on the shelf and they wouldnt give me in store credit because the tag was missing. Um....... it was a Christmas gift...... people tend to take the price tags off. \n\nThey're only getting two stars because VS Customer Service (called them) fixed my issue. Big applause for Corporate Customer Relations on the issue.
0,"Super sized offerings (and prices) does not a good restaurant make!\n\nMy daughter, Kathy, and her beau Keith took me out yesterday to Claim Jumper on Apache Road... I had never been to one of these, even though I had lived in Las Vegas and the Phoenix area the last decade or so.\n\nWhat we had...\nI had the Grilled Liver, Bacon and Onions - A huge plate of Liver with an equally ungodly amount of Onions with a side Biscuit that was the consistency of a BRICK! If you closed your eyes... the Bacon tasted like NOTHING!\n\nKeith had Sliders (Mini Cheeseburgers)... I got to try a couple of these little guys... and no flavor whatsoever despite the warnings of extra-sharp cheese on the menu. Keith also had a bowl of New England Claim Chowder before the meal... he told me not to order it next time.\n\nKathy had the Snow Crab and Chive Quiche with a Small Green Salad - I got to try the quiche later... again no flavor! It looked as appetizing as heck, though. HUGE dish!\n\nFor Dessert... the Brownie Finale... another HUGE dessert! Probably tasted the best... because of all the SUGAR! \n\nEven their cups of Coffee were HUGE!\n\nIn summary... I would not mind the high prices if the food had any kind of flavor... but unfortunately they didn't!\n\nUpdate from my Chef son, Kevin...\nHe said to order the Soups... they're especially good from what he said!"
1,"Had the Fried Chicken it was cooked to perfection hot, crisp and juicy! The crew was friendly and accommodating all food cooked and prepared to order. Service was fast and friendly . If they are on your area give them a try you won't be disappointed !"
0,The only reason I'm leaving a star is because I absolutely have to.   The nicest way to put this is that the best part of my experience was exiting the building. Attentiveness to refills was poor. Appetizers as well as main meal and sides  were like warm and the fish was barely cooked and rubbery.   Broccoli was barely cooked needless to say I will never EVER be back.
0,"So, we came here for a late lunch at 4pm with a group total of 9. 8 total people eating and one baby. The hostess decided to give us crap because we told her 8 instead of 9. Then proceeded to give us an attitude about how many kids were in our group. What does it matter? Is there a kids menu at Bachi Burger? Not that I know of... Anyway, we left after sitting there from 3:45 to 4:20 without getting seated and went to the Bachi Burger in Summerlin. Really disappointed. 2 stars because I know the food is great. -3 for horrible service.\n\nBTW the service at Bachi Burger in Summerlin was excellent. I'll write another separate review for that establishment."

0,"This restaurant has decided that it's too much trouble for them to prepare two different kinds of tacos for their taco plate, so they simply don't allow it. Who's serving who? There are four to a plate. Even more obnoxious, when asked about it, you are given a lecture that their restaurant is based on sharing and how 2 people at the table can each order tacos and they can be shared if \""you're the type of person who shares\"".  Weird... Don't show up unless you are comfortable enough to share with some one in your party off your plate.  A Mexican inspired restaurant that doesn't have refried beans unless it's dinner time, an environment that is uppity and a staff that is condescending and socially awkward. I just wonder how long it will be until they go under. We didn't even stay to eat, we couldn't stomach the attitudes. The rest of my party felt same way."
0,"First off, I asked for aisle seats live and in person at the box office. When we arrived, we found that we were indeed at the end of a row, but not an aisle.  We had to climb over 12 people to get to our seats, which made it very uncomfortable when we walked out in the middle of the performance.... very boring.\n\nEvery seat in this theater-in-the-round has partially obstructed views\n\nDo not get me wrong, the acrobats are very talented and I am a big fan of Mystere, O and KA, but even the failed Elvis show was better than this.\n\nDo not waste your money!"
0,"We walked out.  There was no reason for the poor service we got this evening.  As there were very few people there, lots of open seats were available.  We were seated by the bus boy as soon as we got there.  Then we waited.  When everyone else is already eating 2 minutes is to long to make a table wait.  We left.  My wife spoke out about how this was her 2nd horrible experiace at this location in as many weeks.  Tonight she was feed b.s., l's and e's about how there was a credit card issue.  To us it looked as if our server was just goofing off not really caring if he waited on anyone or not.\n\nGood luck with dinner service here, We've never had this experiace during breakfast, so it'll stay a breakfast place, maybe lunch, but no more dinners."
1,"Muy bueno!  Here's a hidden treasure in the old Garfield barrio.  It's located right next to Garfield Elementary School, so if you passed the school, you went too far.  \n\nWhen you go in, it's like going into someone's house and ordering from their kitchen.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall.  Also important to note that it is a cash-only establishment.\n\nThey only serve burritos & chimichangas NO TACOS.  Their burritos are extremely runny but extremely yummy and will literally explode in your mouth.  I recommend ordering a dozen tortillas on your way out.  \n\nCheck out Rito's when you're feeling adventurous and wanna hang out the locals in the barrio."
1,"Whenever I talk about Madison to someone out of town, they always say \""I hear there is a great Farmer's Market\""\n\nRight they are.  There are few like it.\n\nTake the entire Capital square, and line it with local vendors.  It's quite the experience.\n\nHere's what to expect:  Fresh produce, meats, breads, cheeses, flowers, and more all produced within a short drive of Madison.  You'll also get samples of many of those items.  \n\nYou are going to pay a lot more for stuff than what you'd pay the grocery store, but the point here is not to save money.  It's to contribute to sustainable farm-to-fork production.  You're typically getting organic, free range, well-cared for food.   You'll find many items far tastier than what you'd find at the store as well.\n\nPro tip:  Get there before 9AM or else you'll face massive crowds.  Also, leave the dogs at home, as they are not allowed."
1,Went to this place and it is the bomb. I had shrimp and it was delicious . I would definitely recommend this place for everyone.
0,"I purchased two groupons for this place as it sounded very much like Chipotle, which I love!  My friends and I went in there last night for two salads.  The salad bowls are half the size of Chipotle, the meat is cut so small that it looks like hamburger.  I asked for brown rice and the guy tried to give me pinto beans (I told him 3 times that is not rice - those are beans!).  Brown rice is not even available.  They pride themselves on a peri peri marinade, but the meat had zero flavor, actually everything was bland, no flavor.  \n\nThe cook was busy tossing chips (supposed to be in a bowl) but they landed all over the floor and he just looked at them.  The cashier was nice, friendly and seemed to be the only one of the two employees working.  He dished up the food, rung people up, replaced forks, etc while the cook was on his cell phone complaining about other employees / managers.  \n\nThe bar area had a decent sized TV, but it was turned off.  The restaurant has a bar area that would be great to sit and surf the net on WiFi, but it is not available.  The cook's laptop and newspapers were spread all over the counter leaving no room for customers.\n\nThe whole time we were there, maybe 10 people came in.  Several came in and left.\n\nThe music was ok, but a bit loud for concrete floors and high ceilings as it echoed and seemed much louder.  \n\nI don't want to return there let alone use my other groupon.  I'll contact Groupon to see if that can be refunded."
1,"Sake Bomb!!!  Sunday night this place has the best happy \""hour.\""  All night happy \""hour!\""\nAverage tempanyaki food, but great service and very clean and great for big parties."
0,"Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!"
1,"Always friendly staffs and fast service!  One day, We went there for my sister's birthday. I always get the Shrimps with the *Whole Sha-Bang sauce in medium hot. To me the spiciness is just right, it's not too mild or too hot. Their sausages are pretty good.  The regular fries(not the cajun fries) are also outstanding!  We always bring the left overs to our house and eat with rice the very next day.., was as good as the day before...\nMy only complaint will be on my second visit, there were not much sauce in my bag comparing to the one that I had previously.  I think I enjoy having my 1pound of shrimps at Boiling Crab even though I will be smell like garlic all day, LOL\nMy sister wants to take it to go, freeze it , and bring it to Korea for her husband... I asked her, \"" Is that so good?\""  and she replied, \""I'm so sure that I 'll be craving for the shrimps more than missing you!!!\"""
1,"Really good Sushi, all you can eat menu for 20-25$... pretty reasonable price if you can pack in 25-50 rolls of Sushi in one sitting. Ingredients are always super fresh, the caviar eggs are small and delicious, and the chefs do not get lazy and douse rolls with a mayonaise based sauce to make up for a lack of flavor. Definitely the best Sushi place on the West Side, although there might be some better deals east of downtown that merit a look."
1,"Phoenix House Painting just completed a complete exterior repaint of my home and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend them.  The owner, John Morris, is a veteran of the paint industry.  The guys that work for him are smart, efficient, careful and quick. My home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials. Stop by and take a look.  They are the best !!!"
1,"Treasure Island, also known as the TI, has been around for a while.  Located at the north end of the Strip, TI is sandwiched between the Fashion Show Mall and The Mirage Hotel and Casino.  It across from The Venetian and Wynn.\n\nSince the remodel a few years back, all of the restaurants and clubs have changed and are much better/higher rated than they used to be.  On a recent visit, I noticed that the Christian Audigier club is located where Tangerine used to be.  There is everything from high-end steakhouses to Starbucks coffee on-property.\n\nCirque du Soleil has a show at TI, which is Mystere.  There is also the Sirens of TI show, which is free nightly, and headline acts that perform like Bill Cosby and LeAnn Rimes.\n\nI have had a few funny experiences on this property over the years.  I have nothing bad to say other than I do not visit often because I am usually across the street at one of the aforementioned casinos.  Definitely worth a visit, whether you are staying there or not."
0,"Can I give them minus stars?\nSo I had some overhead track lights that were intermittently not turning on. I put in a request for service through my home warranty company because wiring is covered under my plan. I figured it might be a wiring issue (maybe a loose connection). Well, my warranty company sends out Sunbelt Electric. I was really concerned after reading the other two scathing reviews. \nThe electrician who came over (my mother was home while I was working) came and flipped the switch a couple of times. Of course, as luck would have it...the thing was working when he was there. But the guy just called me and said \""sorry, works fine!\"" and was trying his absolute hardest to convince me that it MUST be a fixture issue (not covered under warranty). He didn't even open up the plates to find out if there were wiring issues. His 35 years of experience tells him that it MUST be a fixture issue, well, then he can't possibly be wrong!! \nWell, I argued with him and he told me that I can make another claim when it happens again and they will come back out and diagnose it, but it takes a day or so to schedule, so by the time they come, who knows if it'll be working??! So, he takes my 60 dollar trade fee for flipping a freakin' switch...and leaves.\n\nNot only was he rude and lazy, but he was trying to demean me. I have a degree in electrical engineering, so I'm not naive when it comes to electricity. \n\nWould not recommend this company to anyone. If your warranty company tries to send them out, call them and request someone different!"
1,Ambiance: Excellent\nRoom: Excellent\nService/Concierge: Excellent\nParking: Reasonable\nLocation: Excellent\nOne can get a good price for this place if planning properly. The location is good but could be better its a short  walk to the main shopping area and restaurants area. There is plenty of parking and the service is great as always with the Delta Chain of hotels. You can park on the street if you want but I would be wary considering what I have seen in Montreal Downtown. We were upgraded to the Signature Club room which allows you access to the Signature Lounge.Continental breakfast and complimentary hors d'oeuvre are served in the Lounge. Great for someone like me who wants a quick coffee fix. Being a Delta Hotel fan I would recommend it any day. This hotel can get busy and sometimes you have a rowdy crowd so I would recommend a higher floor if you can manage it.
1,"First visit this evening and I must say Dustin can make a cocktail! First off, if u go on a Tuesday it's 30% off mescal (my fave spirit) as well as tequila.  All I can say is the talent behind the new Mabel's is a keeper! All around a comforting environment & in loved sitting at the bar. I have a sweet spot for a bartender to give recommendations based on my palate & this is what you will receive here.  Happy Hour is 4-7 with half-priced specialty cocktails. Please make it your next cocktail destination & see Dustin on Tue, Thu and Saturday. I can't wait to go back again."
1,"Simply  BREATH TAKING.. Went here with  hunny  for dinner .. It was simply  beautiful.. We had someone greet us at the doorstep, very courteous and friendly.  i love the atmosphere there because it's so relaxing, tranquil, and seems away from it all.\n\nDinner was beyond my  expectations  I had lobster bisque, not too creamy, I liked that. They often have some great vegetarian options as well.. I had the edamame/ scallion ravioli and martini which was delicious  . Hunny  had the fillet minus the bacon..\n\nOh...this place has some of the best views of Camelback and Paradise Valley .  Upon arrival, you can feel your shoulders start to drop and let the relaxation begin..."
0,"I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.\n\nThe staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again."
1,"It's a hotel desperately trying to be cool, sophisticated and stylish but loses a star because over the last few years the building is looking a bit worn, probably due to its owner going bankrupt in 2010.  We've stayed in the suites at the front over the last 4 years during the fringe - highlights are the huge rooms with floor to ceiling windows and, \""is that really porn in the hotel artwork?\"" and the snug bar around a fireplace upstairs..."
1,"It can be a long wait sometimes, but they are able to text you when your table is ready. Warning though, they will only hold your table for 5 minutes. This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that. Enjoy the that Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!"
0,"I just moved here from out-of-state. So far I've had pretty good experiences in the state of Nevada. But NV Energy was Definitely an exception to that. If I could give zero stars, I would! I feel like everybody else on this page has said it all, so I don't feel like I need to go into a lot more detail. I've never been more frustrated, treated more poorly, or felt more ignorant, after dealing with these people.  Their customer service is inexcusable. If there was another choice, I would definitely go with it. And the fact that there's only one location where you can set up service is ridiculous. Ok. It's sad. I'm done."
1,Want a late night snack at 3am?  Feel like breakfast after you get up at 1pm?  This is your place.  Always dependable.  Never had an issue with the food here.
0,"I came here with several of my co-workers hoping for fun lunch. While the decor was unique and interesting, I felt the black was a bit overdone. It also seems they designed their own chairs and they were really uncomfortable when you sit back. There is some kind of triangular design on the back and it kept digging into my lower back. It forced me to sit on the edge of my seat. Other than the interior decor, the service was prompt and friendly. But there wasn't anyone else in there at the time.\n\nEach of us got a different ramen noodle soup, an order of the waffle with korean beef, edamame, and the sliders.\n\nThe edamame was awesome. Super garlicky with some good dipping sauce. The ramen unfortunately didn't live to my expectations. I had the sesame tonkatsu and the broth felt way too thick and it wasn't hot at all. Maybe room temperature. the noodles were a bit warmer but not by much. I couldn't finish the ramen because it was too thick and it wasn't appetizing because it wasn't hot. My other co-workers agreed that their ramen wasn't hot either. The waffles were okay but not something I would order. I didn't get to try the sliders but they said they were just alright.\n\nI hope for the best for this establishment but it's not a place I would return to."
1,Love this place!! Very friendly staff! Huge selection of guns! Great rental counter and don't forget the awesome selection of full autos and semi autos to rent and shoot!!! Love it! We had a blast! Literally! :) thanks Discount Firearms!! Defiantly recommend this place! Especially the gm he came out just to make sure we had a great time!
0,"Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average."
0,"OK, so this place is not favorable. I do not want to incite any horror sensations. But this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days. Skip this place if you'er craving Thai, go elsewhere."
0,"besides the equipment and place being new and clean the staff is ridiculously rude. I had the chance to get personal trained by staff and Tara is horrible. She doesn't care about her clients and she stands in front of the mirror to look at herself all the time. She is disorganized with appointments and doesn't come out of her \""office\"" unless she has a client. The assistant manager ashley at the front desk walks around like she is lost and gives people a dirty look which is not welcoming at all.I would not recommend."
0,"Greasy , Wet , soagy . They were out of chicken, so i got a mixed of what ever they had left."
1,"My co-worker took me here because we were in the neighborhood and she knew that I really like the Fox Concept restaurants.\n\nThe place exudes a fun atmosphere.  The food was fantastic as well.  I started out with the beet salad which was really good.  The dressing was tasty, they provided an good amount of beets, and I appreciated the pistacchios for the textural contrast.  The beet salad was almost as good as the one at the Arrogant Butcher.  We also partook in the lamb meatballs which were yummy as well.  \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I chose the scallops at the recommendation of my server,  The scallops were of good size and seared on one side, but I would appreciated it more if they were seared on both sides, however.  The scallops were accompanied with scallops and sweet corn polenta which went well with the protein.\n\nI ended the night with the chocolate mousse with cherries which was absolutely divine.\n\nMy server was friendly and attentive and it was a great overall experience."
0,"It was fun, but every plate was very very bland.  I was visiting for a week and decided to try this place based on the reviews.  Absolutely not worth the price.  The Foie Gras was the only thing worth anything in the place."
1,"Every time I go to Scottsdale, I have to come here for dinner.  Since it is only about once a year, I HAVE to have the BBQ Salmon!  It is consistantly awesome, I promise.  We start with the queso dip and the iron skillet corn bread but honestly that salmon is a star and believe me I usually choose steak over fish.  This is a winner.  Where I live we have Houstons and I have pleaded with them to have the corn bread, cheese dip and BBQ salmon put on the menu.  They have declined...pity."
0,"I had such high hopes for this place because of the high reviews, but i was sadly disappointed, my pho dac biet arrived so clear i could see all the way to the bottom of the bowl, i had never had pho broth that was extremely clear i feel like they just gave me a bowl of salt water with noodles and beef in it...after i got done eating i felt like i had a belly full of seawater. This is the second pho place i have tried and will not be back, i recommend jenni pho instead."
0,"Skip & go to Wicked Spoon or Studio B Buffet. If you're into desserts then by all means, go to Bacchanal BUT if you want good, tasty & hot food - then don't go here. I was disappointed. Food was lukewarm & mind you, I got it from the tray that was just refilled. Crab legs were dumped in hot water but that didn't do it for me. Imagine cold crab legs dumped quickly in hot water... what do you get? Lukewarm crab outside with cold crabmeat."
0,"Be careful of this company!  I assure you the customer service you will receive in the store will be great, but that is where it will end.  If you have any warranty issues in the future they will put all the blame on you for everything!  I purchased furniture from them this summer and have had a couple of warranty issues come up.  The owner, Jim, told me that even though I bought the furniture in his store, credit card paid his company, that it wasn't their company's furniture and will not honor ANY warranty at all.  He told me that my furniture has no AZ Leather warranty, no manufacturers warranty--NOTHING.  He even went as far as telling me that I essentially have damaged goods and have to deal with it.\n\nLook at the reviews from other customers in California and you will begin to notice a pattern with these guys.\n\nBuyer beware!"
1,"This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool."
0,"Not a fan. I thought this place was going to have high quality sushi considering the prices and reviews, but I got no such thing. The place was very crowded so service was slow and our waitress neglected us, but when she did come over she was very friendly. Now to the sushi it was really bad. I got 4 pieces of Albacore sushi ($13 can you say over priced!) and it tasted like super market sushi. I also got a California roll and it was made completely out of artificial carb and it coasted $8. The thing that really bothered me out was that the chiefs were putting the receipts  RIGHT ON TOP OF THE FOOD as they waited to be picked up gross..."
1,"You know, this place is good, but....if one were to believe the reviews here, it would seem as though glorious slices of heaven were handed down from Mount Olympus by radiant angels making water from wine with flour, yeast and pepperoni as someone hands their money over the counter.\n\nIt's good....and it was fun to check in here...but it's not the BEST PIZZA EVER!!!\n\nThat said, if you're walking on the strip towards the city center and feeling a hankering for some very tasty pie, walk into this casino and look for that tube-style elevator near the back quarter of the casino floor.  It will, once one completes the journey to the 4th floor, deposit you mere feet from the unmarked entrance of this really nifty find.\n\nI wonder, given the success the whole lets-make-it-a-treasure-hunt sort of thing, if other casinos will start to hide random businesses in the nooks of their properties?"
1,"If you like dumplings you'll love Qing Hua.  I think there were close to 30 (or more) dumpling varieties on the menu - featuring vegetarian, pork, seafood, chicken, lamb, beef and various combinations as well as various additions such as cabbage, coriander, curry, etc.  And, you can get them steamed, boiled or fried (for $1.50 more).  15 dumplings to an order for steamed or fried - you get a few more if you have them boiled.\n\nI had the steamed pork with coriander dumplings and they were very good - extremely tender and flavorful.  And, very filling!  Total cost was just over $10 and included hot tea.\n\nWith so much variety, my only wish is that they'd offer combinations - even if they'd charge a bit more for them.  I would have loved to try a few more flavors and have a few fried dumplings.  Maybe they do offer this if you ask - but it'd be nice to mention on the menu as well."
0,Absolutely not. My drink was weak as hell. Tastes like sour lime juice and ice. It's decor is great but whyyyyy is everything over-priced?
1,"This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!"
0,We heard alot about this place so took the drive there. Nice place. Maybe a few too many TVs on the one wall. Can't see watching your favorite game with everything else going on.\nServer was great. He explained everything even when more of our guests arrived. \n Homemade bbq sauce for the ribs ruined the ribs. And why shredded cold beets in the pork sliders? Salad was warm. Chili had an odd taste to it too. Nacho platter was big. Wings were dry and overcooked.\nI doubt we'll go back. Maybe if it was closer we would give it a 2nd chance but if you can't get it right the 1st time....
0,They ignored our attempts to order and would not acknowledge us at the window when we tried to see if anyone was even there. So rude and the food is cold.
0,"I'd love to believe when you vacation to a resort-like hotel the the spa experience would be stellar.  Guess that makes me wrong for once.  I'm only human.  My girl friends and I had a variety of services including manicures, pedicures, polish changes and eyelash applications.  As expected, each came at a hefty price.\n\nWhile I understand there are a multitude of other offerings, you'd think they'd be able to cover the basics?  2 stars is generous.  Oh - and if you think you may be pampered with a glass of wine or mimosa, think again...that will cost you an additional $15."
0,The place is nice but it would be great if they would be consistent... Every time you go the food is different
0,"They broke almost as much as they fixed.\n\nHad my Honda in to fix a power steering pump.  They fixed it,and a motor mount they claimed was broken,  but when I got the car back it made a scraping sound whenever it hit a mild bump.  That noise was not there before.  Now they say it might be the front struts.  They gave an estimate of $900 to fix something they broke.  Called national Honda, but no help there.  I am not going to pay them to fix something they broke, as that only rewards incompetence."
1,"Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure."
1,"Came in to get my a Fossil watch repaired that belonged to my uncle.  The store owner/watchmaker was very friendly and let me in even though it was 5 minutes to closing time. He took one look at my watch, saw that it was ill-fitting, and proceeded to work his magic. We made pleasant conversation for about fifteen minutes as he adjusted, shined, and set my watch to the proper time. And the best part - he only charged me $5! I offered him $10 for being so thorough and for staying open last his posted hours but he wouldn't accept it. Don't let the pawn shop style sketchness fool you - this is one hole-in-the-wall worth visiting."
0,"Not four seasons worthy! Food was salty and amateurish, as was the staff. the transition from the bar to the restaurant was awkward. Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's."

1,"My only complaint about the Great Dane Brewing company is that it made me miss my college days. \nThis is a wonderful little eatery that has nice, laid back vibe to it. Our server was wonderful and made sure that our beer glasses were full. \nThere is a beautiful outdoor seating area in the back and a beautifully decoded indoor area. \nWe had the boneless wing appetizer. The portions were generous and the sauce (while not hot) was quite tasty. \nThe burger that I had was juicy and delicious. The next time we are in Madison, we will be sure to stop back in."
1,"Dr. Harter is an absolutely amazing and caring doctor.  He has been my OB since my daughter was born in 2009. I had an emergency c-section due to severe preeclampsia, after planning a VBAC. I was devastated by the turn of events, but Dr. Harter held my hand and told me he was very sorry but I was too sick to wait any longer, but I could definitely have a VBAC someday. Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have asked for a better or more supportive OB. *Note*Due to his popularity, it can be hard to get in to see him, and wait times can be long because he's delivering babies...a lot! Those are small inconveniences to me, to get a good doctor!  :)"
1,"When it comes to book shopping, I'm more of a get-in-and-go type than a browser. I usually go out to buy a book for a specific purpose (e.g., an upcoming trip where I'll have lots of down time), so I appreciate when bookstores lay out books in the front for quick selecting. Borders usually does a really good job of separating out some quick picks by type (new non-fiction, clearance, bestsellers), so it's a good fit for my book shopping style. \n\nI went to this location to pick a book for this upcoming weekend (my husband is taking the AZ bar exam early next week, so I'll have a lot of alone time) and quickly found something that looked interesting on the bestsellers table. The downside of Borders is that the prices are high compared to  buying a book online (my top choice is Amazon.com), but the upside is that it's easier to browse than on Amazon, where I usually find book shopping overwhelming if I don't have a specific book or genre in mind. \n\nThe staff at this particular location are friendly and the parking is definitely ample. There is also a Seattle's Best inside this location, a coffee shop I love, but I didn't buy anything from it on my first visit here."
0,"I was disappointed to see the prior Yelp page removed - why? because it was accurate? This place (when it was at its prior location way back when) used to be cool, when there was a sense of community. They had flyers, local periodicals. Not anymore. And, not only that, they do readings directly in front of the tarot deck cabinet - l literally have to walk around the table to get to the tarot cards - so, I'm minding my own business looking for a deck, and I have to hear someone's personal stuff like. Um...hello? Isn't that a little bit unethical? \""For entertainment value\"" is one thing, but would you YouTube your appointments with your financial adviser or physician for everyone to see? I mean, c'mon...show some *bleep* respect for the people coming in to your store and give them a little privacy. I wouldn't want customers strolling by me if I came in for a reading. It's just tacky. Everything in this review is accurate and can be corroborated, and I'd be glad to re-post the same sentiment if the store tries to whitewash their Yelp page again. Namaste."
1,Best Pizza I've had so far in my 29 years of existence! lol.. it has moved over to MGM grand for those that don't know
1,"If you can't decide on a lunch spot come to Pizza Brutta. Don't think about it. Just do it. \n\nWhen you get here order at the counter. It doesn't really matter what you order because it's all delicious but I suggest a Rossoverde pie and the caprese salad. Wash it down with a Dale's Pale Ale.\n \n Service is always fast and courteous so don't forget to drop a few bucks in the tip jar. After all, you're eating delicious food for a really low price point. Don't be stingy."
0,"Woke up on a Friday morning and urgently needed a pho fix.\n\nThe special combo beef pho was a no-go.\nThe soup was really oily along with a herbal taste.\n However, they have fresh coconut juice and perfect Vietnamese coffee !!\n\nUm, won't be back."
0,"I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe."
0,"Hadn't been to a Sonny's in about 10 years. Now I am reminded why. The food was cold. It isn't difficult to keep food warm. Throw it in a microwave! I wouldn't know the difference! Also the pulled pork was very greasy. Almost waxy. I'm sure the waxy parts could be attributed to temperature (cold!). \nThe salad bar has decent, sometimes odd, options, but there were things like egg salad dropped into cottage cheese and some pink marshmallow fluff? Not really appetizing. \nDon't get the cornbread. It was a cold, gross tasting brick that was raw in the middle. \nThe fried okra appetizer is the size of a single side serving. \nAnyway. The service was spotty. We asked for refills and they brought us the wrong drinks in to-go cups. No one seemed to notice the obviousness of our dissatisfaction. Full plates, yet signing the check....... \nOur server was nice enough but it was just not worth spending money on ever again."
0,"Awful service.  Did not get my full order going thru drive thru.  Realized it after I got home.  Drove back and went inside to complain.  The guy actually tied handing me the bag of food that he forgot to give me after it had been sitting there for 20 minutes.  Asked for a refund for compensation, but they refused!"
1,"I love this place. My least favorite experience here involved spending 15 minutes to get from one side of the club to the next and it was still a great experience simply because New Kids on the Block were there. I've been to several events at this club (including a movie screening which was surprisingly awesome) and it's always been a fun time. The music is usually pretty good, the drunks seem pretty happy, and the bottle service was kind of amazing. I was here for a friend's birthday and I am completely spoiled now after that table experience (they might have been great simply because her face was on the flyer for that party but I like to think that they're just always that wonderful). The performers I've seen here were great and the layout is pretty rectangular and open. I love the terrace because it's great to get away from the smoke and noise every once in a while and it's a completely different atmosphere (equally fab). This is one of the ONLY clubs in town that I come to repeatedly just for the hell of it.\n\nP.S. For those of us who are morbidly curious, I asked security how many girls fall flat on their faces at the stairs per night (the answer was between four and five)."
0,"So, I paid extra to have a package delivered same-day via Amazon. I get home from work at about 3:30 and wait for my package. 6 o'clock rolls around, I check the delivery status, and it shows me \""delivery attempted\"" at 4:03. What? I was home, literally next to the door and never heard a knock.\n\nI called down to the main office and they tell me he had no gate code. They have my phone number, why couldn't he have called me? They say they do not supply drivers with cell phones. Even without a gate code, the gate is right next to the office that he could've dropped it off at! This all happens on a Friday, lucky me they don't deliver on weekends so now I'm stuck waiting either waiting until Monday for my package or going to their office and picking it up myself. Joy...\n\nUpdate: So I called back to find out when I could pick up my package, the woman I spoke to said her coworker has to call the driver to find out when he will return. They don't supply their employees with cell phones, remember? Anyway, she said she would get back to me. \n\nI got a call back within a 1/2 hour and she said the driver won't be back at the office until 9 o'clock that night, and they'll be closed. My package will be available on Monday, and guess what, now I HAVE to pick the package up. This is unbelievable. BBB here I come..."
0,"I expected so much more from Wynn.  We were invited by the Casino host Mr. Brando as we were about to cash out our chips.   We went for their infamous Champagne Brunch.  That Sunday was crowded but we didn't mind because the host said go straight to the VIP/Invited guest line, and tell them I sent you there and if theres a problem call my desk.  \n\nAs soon as we got to the front of the line, the rude cashier said to us go back to the end of the line bc you don't have a fast pass??  And before I could say anything she yelled out \""NEXT!!!\""\nI\n said to her,  \""wait... call the casino host they've invited us.  Here's our players club please look it up for our complimentary meal.\""  \n\nWhen we sat down, wasn't until 2 trips to the buffet line when our waitress finally came out and asked, \""what would you like to drink???\"" \n\nWe've both responded \""Champagne brunch please...\""  \n\nShe replied \""You have to pay extra for that!\""  \n\nAgain, I had to explain to her the Casino's host invited us if you have any problem just call the desk.  She didn't bother either instead just offer us water.  \n\nI must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.  However, we're at the Wynn and not Circus Circus.  Obviously we didn't have problem paying $50/person meal when we were playing $500-$1000 hand probably the only reason why we were invited for complimentary meal.  Regardless, we've been to plenty of fine establishments and we've never been treated the way we did.  You would think at a 5-star resort place like this would have a superb customer service.  I guess I was too distracted by the pretty decor.\n\n**UPDATE:  Mr. Brando have been addressed with these issues and he's doing everything in his power to make-up for our bad experience.  He handled the issue very professional and we would definitely come back because of him."
0,"Stopped yesterday for a drink after shopping and wanted to check the place out for future possible dining.  We waited and waited for our drinks.  It was a Friday afternoon and was not busy at the time of our arrival.  We had to order our drinks twice as it seemed the first order was lost somehow.  Not a good first impression.  The waitress said she would make it up to us regarding the very poor service,not sure what she meant but she did not live up to her word.  My next beer came quickly but did have to ask for service; she did not come on her own.  By the time we left the restaurant was busy and very noisy.  I read the menus and was impressed with the pricing and choices from pastas to steak to gluten free.  Most entrees were under $20.  The decor was upscale and trendy with comfortable seating. Undecided if we will return."
0,"The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!"
0,"More like Crapmine's Pizza.  This place can suck it.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and was told it would be 20-30 minutes.  After waiting patiently for over an hour, I gave them a call and was told the driver was 2 minutes away.  20 minutes later, I called them to complain.  After my 30 second rant, the scum on the other side of the phone was like, \""I'm sorry brah, what was that?\""  Psshh.  Whatevs."
0,"Thought I would give the Hula another try. Had the pork sandwich with coleslaw. Short story is the pork was tough as leather and hard to chew. The Mai Tai was a little on the lite side and tart side as well. The server was nice, but after the food was delivered to the table, he disappeared. Can't say that Hula will be a return visit, but who knows."
0,"Do you want to die shortly after being slapped in the face with a cover charge that shouldn't be charged and then having your girlfriend gang raped on the dance floor?\n\nIt receives two stars simply because I used to like the place.  Pool, good music, dancing, reasonable drink prices.  But, after a couple of tense situations, witnessing fights on a near weekly basis, and a parking lot shooting....I'll pass these days.\n\nI don't do karaoke so that side of the establishment might be okay."
1,"#30DaysOfYelp: 22/30\n\nWish I had a glass topped Yamaha grand with a fancy tv screen down the side! No wonder it's called The Million Dollar Piano...\n\nGo see this show! I play some piano so I think Elton John's pretty cool, but I'm not such a huge fan that I'd buy tickets see him at home. Glad I did in Vegas though! I saw this with some family, and I was blown away by his personality, enthusiasm, the lights/video, and his band! We sat on the 2nd mezzanine (almost nosebleeds) but on the left side, so we had a great view of him playing. He played a solid 2 hours of hits, and it was so great to watch everyone together, especially that percussionist in the back. I was a percussionist in school so it was awesome to see an expert's skills. Best way to play a tambourine is with a fancy dance & flourish!\n\nAs with all concerts, there are always some people in the audience who like it WAY too much. One lady, who was a couple rows below was dancing the whole 2 hours, her hands waving in the air, blocking the view. I don't mind people enjoying music & having a blast, but respect people around you, woman! They paid for their tickets too! I thought it was funny though, when Elton played \""Circle of Life\"" she sat down & stopped wriggling altogether. She didn't even clap at the end of the song. She must really hate The Lion King! What's up with that?\n\nIf you can get floor seats near the front, do it. At the end, some audience members went up on stage & gathered around the piano for the last song. Elton was whisked away really quickly though...I guess he would be swarmed if he stayed, heh. Must be nice to have bodyguards."
0,"My husband and I scrimped and saved every last extra penny for a year so we could take a trip when our young son was old enough to leave with Grandma and Grandpa for 5 days. We decided to go to Vegas, since it's cheap to fly there, and I had never been. I think our choice of hotel essentially ruined the entire trip. From the moment the cab driver dropped us off the service was lousy. We had to wait HOURS for our room to be ready, when we were told it'd be minutes. Still early in the trip with our wide eyed optimism we checked our bags and decided to check out \""the shops.\"" After a short trip through a curving hallway of novelty shops and closed up gates, we were left wanting. We were hungry so we ate at McDonald's only restaurant on the \""shopping level\"" besides Mexican food reeking of dirty socks filled with chicken. After we ate we decided to check out the casino floor, and gamble a little. No one looked happy to be there, the bartender at the big circular bar was aloof and disinterested. When we finally got to the room it was all right...we weren't planning on spending a whole lot of time there anyhow. We choose the place because it was cheap...how could we expect a whole lot more than what we got? But after the first night trying to walk the strip from the Stratosphere, we took cabs for the rest of the trip. We definitely made up for what we saved on the room on taking cabs all night long for the rest of our stay.\n\nNot worth it. Really put a damper on the whole trip."
0,The worst tasting filipino food ive ever tasted in my life. Food was cold and wasnt fresh. rice smelled funny. best to say filipino food is better cooked at home. The 2 reasons why it didnt get  1 star is 1. Its on the strip and 2. only pinoy spot.on the strip.
0,"Maybe I am just biased as to what I think piano bar atmospheres should be like (lots of singing, audience interaction, places to stand up and dance, and views of the performers from the entire bar), but this place on a Friday night just didn't seem to check off any of those requirements for me.\n\nIt's much smaller than I would have expected, and had a very low energy crowd when I was there (midnight on a Friday). The performers didn't seem to do a ton to help that. This has definitely more of a concert venue for a small crowd than a fun time with fun music. It feels cozy, which just seemed weird for a piano bar that was playing fun music. There is a cover to get in, but there is no reason to ever pay one, nor would it be worth it. Just head next door to Buck and Badger, order a drink (or better yet a shot-ski), and keep the receipt which you can then use that to get yourself in. We managed to find a couple seats at a table in the very back of the room by the bar, but had essentially no view of what was actually happening on stage. There are a lot of tables that do have good views, but they were full when we got there.\n\nThe two people on stage played all of the standard piano sing-along songs, but it certainly isn't the kind of place where you can put your arm around your friends and sway back and forth screaming Styx, Elton John, or John Mellencamp at the top of your lungs. I guess you could all sing to each other across the table while sitting down, but that just isn't as fun. It's probably the atmosphere that they are shooting for, but it didn't seem very fun to me and certainly didn't need a cover charge, especially when the performers make you pay for requests. \n\nThe actual bar earns them some good tidings from me though. I liked the selection of local craft beers that they had on tap. There wasn't a huge selection, but they did have some good options. Prices were a little high for a place that charges cover, but not terrible. The bartenders were good, and did a decent job of getting everyone served. We ordered all our drinks at the bar because we were right next to it, but they did a great job of coming around and clearing out empties and checking on us.\n\nI don't think that this is a place that I would visit again, or if I did I would make it a stop earlier in the night when things were calm and we were just looking for a few drinks in a classier atmosphere. Like I said, this place may have put together exactly what they were going for, but it didn't meet any of my expectations that I have when I want to go to a piano bar."
1,"Let's just start by saying that if red meat always tasted this good I would have eaten more red meat in my life. This was easily one of the top three meals I have ever eaten. And the service was fantastic to boot. \n\nWaygu beef is their specialty, so why would you not get the Waygu beef?  It's not cheap but c'mon, this is Vegas, my guess is you've already wasted as much on slots/poker/craps/roulette/etc. If you're not a local, when in Vegas, live it up! \n\nWe decided to get the three course meal, and it was an obscene amount of food. Between two of you, you get three half salads, lobster bisque, two types of Waygu beef, three sides and four deserts. Redic, but oh so delicious. When you look at the cost of that, compared to the cost of the filet, just go with the three course meal, you can't go wrong. Nothing disappointed - and even though I could only eat one bite of the monkey bread, man that was one delicious bite. \n\nSure, you can find a less expensive place to eat, but you won't find a more delicious steak."
0,"Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!"
1,Salsa bar alone is worth it.  Awesome artwork is worth it.  Best tacos/burritos are the cactus ones.  Not overpriced.  We love this place.
1,"So I just moved to Glendale AZ from Los Angeles and was craving sushi. I did what I always do & looked on Yelp for nearby sushi places, because Yelp has always been the best tool for finding anything great. I was so delighted to see Yen Sushi was less than a block from my house and looked like the highest rated place nearby. I decided to check it out by myself for lunch. I am not a big fan of spicy food, so I was hoping there would be some great non-spicy sushi as well (because a lot of people on Yelp only spoke of the spicy rolls.) \n\nThe first thing I realized was that there was a lot of choices just for sushi & I liked how they were categorized baked, tempura, fresh, etc. I saw so many rolls that looked yummy, but they were expensive. I didn't like the prices so much, but for good sushi, you can't expect it to be super cheap...I'll have to try out the happy hour next time. I decided on the Hawaiian Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, and their California Roll.\nMy favorite was the Shrimp Tempura Roll..it was HUGE! So yummy & it came with tempura vegetables. The Hawaiian Roll is good; it is garlicky! I got the CA Roll because I figured if that was not good then I was S.O.L.  I now know that 3 rolls are waaaay to much for me. I am used to 6 pieces that are small. These are pretty big with 7 or 8 pieces! It cost me $27.00 for lunch which was more than I would usually pay, but now I know I can get away with 2 rolls to fill me up. I would definetly recommend this place anytime. I am excited to try the happy hour, but I will be bummed about the special rolls not being on sale, because those are my favs."
0,"I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans."
1,"5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!\n\nI had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. \n\nFood wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.\n\nHerbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.\n\nDrunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!\n\nMango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!\n\nThe panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!\n\nBut, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says \""C'mon, man!\""\n\nService aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!"
1,"The food here is very fresh and very thai.  I really enjoyed the red curry with chicken -you need to try!  Ive eaten Thai at other places in Pittsburgh (and there are really no good asian restaurants in pittsburgh anyway), and this is THE place for Thai."
0,"AYCE sushi: The sushi is very good. Expect to wait for a long time for the food. The sushi menu isn't too diverse or different. Most sushi rolls are the same with 1 or 2 differences from another sushi roll that's on the menu. The ordering time is 45 mins for lunch. Order A LOT when they initially take your order. Also, keep track of what you order, chances are.. You will not get it.\n\nService: Not the best in the world. The staff are so so. I actually witnessed the staff argue with a customer about the wait time. \""Sorry, you have never waited for food? We are busy\""."
1,"I can't believe I haven't already written a review for this place!!! Sorry Guys! So if you're reading this review, debating on if you should check this place out tonight, stop thinking and GO!  Super fun, great atmosphere, I have come to know the owner and staff as you will soon too, and they are amazing. This is a great place to go with a group of friends, there's boardgames, music, poetry slams, and great company! Don't forget to wear your coolest hat on friday for a fun treat!"
1,Great eatery!!!!   The service was a bit slow but nice atmosphere and great food!!!
1,"\""If you can't change the situation, then change the way the situation affects you.  The choice is yours!\""---Unknown\n\nSure it can get hot..think theraputic sauna type heat.  The rest of the year is great! As my friends and family to the east are shoveling snow I am sitting out on my patio.  \nPlenty of sun and fun here in the Valley!  I have never been lacking in options for things to do in Phoenix.  I can stay in and play or take on a hike in many of our Urban trails through the city.  We have several great places to eat and play.  There is always something new to try. \n\nDeciding to live downtown close to work was a decision I enjoy more each day.  But I withhold 1 star for the lack of Green Space/Parks and the unwilling nature to improve the residential/pedestrian conditions through downtown and the need to improve some of the public transportation options through town.  \n\nBut I am not just naggin' here as I am one of few that is tryin to get involved to make changes where I can."
1,It is the place I go for burgers.  Fatburgers.  The shakes and fries simply tidy the meal up in my opinion.  :)
1,"Easily the best wings in Charlotte. We've come here two nights in a row now and haven't had any problems. Well, tonight my BLT came on Texas toast instead of a bun like I requested but to be honest it doesn't even matter. The food is awesome, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Location is a bit odd but don't let that throw you off. Definitely go, get the wings with the honey gold sauce, have a $1.75 beer and relax."
1,We had never experienced hiring moving company before. We usually rent a truck ourselves and search near and far for friends and family that will help us. I am so glad that we found Denali Moving. They were very professional and I felt like my belongings were in good hands. They took all the stress out of the loading and unloading. If and when we need to move again we will be using Denali Moving.
1,So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!
1,"An excellent place for any occasion. Besides the great entrees, grilled artichoke was awesome. Angelo was on top of his game with excellent service and recommendations."
1,"We had them out to clean our carpets this past week and they did a great job. The carpeting hadnt been cleaned in about 1 1/2 yrs. so it was nice to have them turn out like new again. They were courteous,showed up on time and did the job in a reasonably fast amount of time. I am going to have them back to clean my grout too.I would recommend Carpet Monkeys to my friends."
0,"4-5-14 - Three times I visited the Phoenix Panera  on Central and Thomas.  They have a mouthwatering picture of their breakfast sandwich: egg, bacon and cheese.  The first time I was 2 minutes late to order the sandwich, of course I waited in line for 15 minutes before having the opportunity to order.  The second time I waited for more than 10 minutes just to order their green tea, which turned out to be horrible.  The third time my husband and I made a morning trip so that I could order the breakfast sandwich.  What a waste of time and money.  The real sandwich does not look at all like the picture and we were extremely disappointed in the quality.  Also, the staff was under-trained because she did not know how to ring up my husband's order.  Don't waste your time or money."
0,"This is my fourth time at this place and lets just say it's getting worse. Food is ok nothing special. The twin cheeseburger I had recently was better than last time. The last couple times the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, and pour a beer! Mixed Drinks tasted like crap. Idk how you can mess up a jack and coke.lol. If you want a good drink, ask for mary the bartender. Shes the only one that can bartend. The one thing Ill will give them is all there staff is great looking!"
1,"Amazing. I always take out of towners to CM. Best sandwiches in charlotte, amazing breakfast and the atmosphere is great. I order lunch from here at least 2-3 times a month, if not more. Does get busy during weekday lunch so if you are on a time crunch order ahead. Great patio area and lots of happenings (music, tastings etc)"
1,"This gal came into my shop referred by someone else ad was one of the most quality referrals to date.  I own an artisans boutique in old town Scottsdale and we host workshops in the arena of arts and social interests . . . . Teresa taught some workshops to moms on infant massage.  Soon after that I decided to personally get a massage from her bc she mentioned that she does ah-shiatsu massage and I had never had a massage like that before.  I loved it!  I've been back! She is really strong, and careful at the same time.  Her studio is clean and peaceful and she is very knowledgeable about the body.  I have referred her to friends and plan on going back again. She is professional yet seems like someone you have known for years. Love that I found something new to enjoy!"
1,We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.  Happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with $3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps. My husband is a huge fan of the wings!
1,The chicken tacos are great I hate them two days in a row since I am not out here much.
0,"Are you kidding me?!?!?!?\n$610 after takes for 4 tires priced at $105/each! $180 in installation and taxes????

1,"I thought the chocolates were ok. They were all nicely laid out...very pretty...they were ok.\n\nThe real story here is the Frozen Yogurt. I lived in Los Angeles for 3 mths and while I was there I got addicted to Pinkberry. You know...that craze going on over there with the \""tart\"" fro-yo. Its is all the magazines people!\n\nIt was bad. I mean I was going to Pinkberry like 5 times a week. \n\nSo I come to Arizona and there are no \""tart\"" frozen yogurt places to be found. I was going through serious withdrawal. Hands shaking...headaches...that kind of thing (well not really...I may be exaggerating...but I wanted to draw a picture for you)\n\nANYWAYS....I was reading through the \""Phoenix New Times Best of 2007 edition\"" and they happened to mention the \""Best Yogurt in Arizona\"". I was shocked to read this little candy shop was selling Red Mango Yogurt (basically the originator of the whole tart yogurt thang).\n\nI could not wait to make the trip over there. Lets just say I read the review around 9pm last night and guess who showed up to get fro-yo today..yup you guessed it little ol' me.\n\nYou must try this yogurt  if you are a \""tart\"" yogurt virgin. It is fat free and only comes in two flavors (green tea & original)..then you can load it full of various toppings (my favorites are the fresh fruit,...yum).\n\nJust be warned...its kinda pricey. A small is 4.50."
0,"Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. \n\nI knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. \n\nPasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. \n\nI wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is \""Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea\"". \n\nThere. \n\nThat's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?"
0,"Great food .Worst male Caucasian server ever my. friend was served my meal and when he gave her rightful  meal he expected me to eat it. \""EAT your Food\"".was what he told me and I stayed polite and asked for a new meal order He refused to give me a new plate that wasn't half eaten I didn't cause a scene and waited to pay for my bill classy and politely at the regester. I only paid for what I ate and didn't pay for the Eel.he yelled at me and had crude comments even said he'd call the cops I told him to I had done Nothing wrong.  He talked to his manager and told me I cost them 17.00usd. My friend told him to stop yelling at me I was on the verge of tears. Im not a rude person and I felt I was harrassed by his rude comments and the fact he kept looking down my friends shirt.The manager stood there on his cell the whole time.   .."
0,"Ambiance very nice, but the food was OK at best.  I would have given it three stars, but when you take the price (very high) into consideration, it just isnt worth it.  Nothing bad, just not worth $60 for lunch.  Very, very average taste and we ordered the signature rolls.  There are dozens of sushi places in Phoenix where you can get sushi at least as good as Pure for half the cost.  One more thing - the maguro was pretty low quality - pale pink in color as opposed to the bright red that you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber (or at least this price)."
0,"Went here on a Saturday night with my family for dinner. When the server came to get our drink order, we each asked for water ( there was eight of us) and we also ordered nachos and some other appetizers. She came back with 5 waters and informed us that they were out Tortilla chips. Next we ordered another appetizer. The server came back and told us they were out of that too. My sister ordered a drink and they couldn't make it so she got a chocolate milk that wasn't mixed up.  I ordered a glass of red wine and when i said the name, the server looked at me like I had three heads. I had to explain to the server that the restaurant she worked at served a specific brand of wine and that is what I was asking for. Our server kept disappearing for long periods of time even though there was only one other table of two in the entire place. It took her forever to finally come and take our dinner order. Where we were sitting, we had a view to the kitchen line and a few of our dishes clearly sat under heat lamps for a while. My sisters dish was crispy and dry when it shouldn't have been and my mom's was dry on top and soggy on the bottom. Oh, and they must have been rationing water as well because despite asking twice for refills, we never got them. In short, service sucked, food was alright. Definitely will not be going back."
1,"Ok, so Pinkberry infiltrating the Charlotte FroYo scene wasn't my greatest hope and dream, but the Arboretum location has turned me into a believer. Walk into the IKEA-laden shop and feast your eyes upon some of the most audacious flavors known to the Yogurt. The staff always assists newbies and hands out samples like its a festival. My adivce: If you've never been to Pinkberry or you are trying froyo for the first time, sample all of them. There is always a good range of regular flavors and a few adventurous choices. \n\nThe staff always remembers us and knows that we get two minis. Thanks for the recognition! We may as well start a Pinkberry clubhouse nearby. \n\nToppings: The fruit is cut a little too large for my liking, but suffice is to say that it is fresh and not out of a gross can or frozen. All together now: \""Dark Chocolate Crisps are the best thing since sliced bread.\"" Aaaand there was much rejoicing throughout the land. These are the best topping for....any of the yogurts. I don't even care if it's mango, these little guys are your best friend. Perfect amount of crunch and chocolate flavor. Like a miniature chocolate symphony of crunchy greatness packed in each spoonful. \n\nThanks, Pinkberry for entering the Charlotte scene so tastefully. You've won over this FroYo aficionado. Cheers!"
0,"This dentist is very nice but I do have question some of his suggestions. He wanted to put an enamel backing on my front teeth because he said they were cracked. I think I would have noticed if my front teeth were cracked. My two front teeth have a little ridge in the middle- it has always been there and that is just the shape of my teeth. My dentist says my front teeth are perfect and there is nothing wrong with them. He also wanted do a deep cleaning and I had no idea what that was and he explained what it was and that I had a $200 deductible for that. I told my mom about the deep cleaning and she told me that is for people with gum disease and that I don't need it since my gums and teeth are healthy. I told the dentist that I discussed it with my mom who had previously been a dental hygienist and he said that he would waive my deductible and just not tell the insurance company. I was so stunned I said fine and he took about 5 minutes in my mouth with using this tool to do the deep cleaning. It was a strange experience. I didn't realize until today that his \""deep cleaning\"" wasn't even as thorough as my new dentists regular cleaning. I'm glad I found a new dentist that I trust my pearly whites with."
1,"Sweet Republic is seriously amazing.\n\nI have high standards for frozen dairy treats, and Sweet Republic is waaayy up there! \n\nI was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors: Blue Cheese Honey, Sweet Corn, Real Mint, Maple Pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - YUM!\n\nI was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are (incredibly) open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes it the perfect late night date spot :) \n\nThe shop is supercute, decor is contemporary and cheerful, with unique lighting fixtures. The tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again, very date friendly! You can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness. They have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing Connect Four with a friend?\n\nThe menu is excellent: from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings, you really can't go wrong.\n\nI went in expecting to order the Campfire S'More Sundae, but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the Pecan Turtle Sundae in a waffle cup... omgoodness, so, so GREAT. Before settling on my sundae, I did get a quick sample of the Plum Verbena icecream and wow - light, refreshing, and unique - definitely a good pick if you're in the mood for a scoop or two. \n\nNow, back to the Pecan Turtle Sundae: I've had lots of Turtle Sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else I've ever tasted. I seriously dreamed about it from the time I left Sweet Republic until the following weekend, when we returned so that I could have it again (and share it with my Grandmother, who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat!) \n\nThe sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness. The waffle bowl was the crowning glory: sweet, crispy, crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one :) \n\nMy husband ordered the Cookie Mintifesto and he loved it, although I wasn't a huge fan of the \""real\"" mint - I prefer fake mint, I guess :) It was pretty \""brisk\"" and not very sweet. \n\nMy son tried the Honey Blue Cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and \""mmm-mmm\""ing the whole time. \n\nService was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they're busy, the employees seem stressed. \n\nI can't recommend Sweet Republic enough as a must-try destination in itself, but it will also become an \""anytime\"" place that you'll find yourself headed to every opportunity you have."
1,"I came to Vegas on the weekend where the Finals Rodeo was starting...it was so interesting.  Every single casino you walked into, you'll get cowboys and cowgirls galore!! \n\nShhhh....don't tell anyone, but cowboys do exsist. These were real live in the flesh cowboys, with the tight jeans, plaid button ups (tucked in), big belt buckle, cowboy boots...and to finish off the outfit a big ass cowboy hat! \n\nI've never been anywhere with tons of cowboys just walkin' around. There were block parties sponsered by crown royal where some of the little streets were closed down on Las Vegas Blvd. and they had drinks, country music and a mechanical bull. \n\nI was very impressed with the transformation of the Vegas strip into a rodeo finals for all the cowboys! It was fascinating, growing up in Southern California, I'm not too exposed to real cowboys, perhaps just at the country line dancing bars I've been to, which I call the cowboy bar. But this was a real treat for me. \n\nNow I can cross off meeting real life cowboys off my list. Thanks Rodeo Finals for holding it in Vegas! Yippee ki yay Mo..."
1,Great service great atmosphere and good food!!!! The mahi tacos and jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes are good. Will come back and try the tempura tuna tacos
1,"I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great."
1,"I really liked the pizza, salad, and fettuccine. Towards the end I loved the sorbet ice cream. It was a mixture of cherry, vanilla, and chocolate. It was very different. The service was really good. All the waiters filled my water up when it was half way. They weren't those annoying waiters they ask you every 2 seconds if you need something. Since it's so close to lifetime fitness I might as well go there after the gym!"
0,"Cottage Express is almost completely unremarkable, as they are one of many fast-food Chinese restaurants in strip malls in a city that has dozens, if not hundreds of them.  They do stand out in a few respects, and unfortunately food is not one of them.  At least not in a good way.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is that their banner proclaims that this is the fifth location for this enterprise in the Charlotte area.  Yet strangely I have never noticed another, not even as I attempted to find one online while I was creating this review (note: I did eventually find one place up near El Taco Veloz with a similar name).  Perhaps a marketing tactic, or maybe they are just using another name for this new store.  Whatever the case, it is still odd that not a single other location turns up.  Anywhere.\n\nNext up is the staff.  Generally these small, dimly-lit quick-serve locations are staffed by individuals who do not speak particularly good English, yet are generally regarded as being at best one generation removed from (whatever country they have decided to represent via their food).  Not here.  This staff is instead a couple of teenage girls who are not only definitely American, they let you know at every turn they are interested in only your money, and the food is well down their list of priorities.\n\nFinally, instead of being served something that comes up rather quickly by a quick turn in one massive wok, you get to choose from a steam table.  Not quite a buffet, because you do not get to go back for seconds - and the food on the table does not appear to have been refreshed any time in the last few hours, or perhaps days."
0,"NOT TO BE TRUSTED!\n\nA great getaway for my wife goes down as my worst experience ever!!!\nOr should I say, no experience.\n\nPurchased a 2 nigh package through Casablanca Express in Vegas at the Riveria...  brand new, renovated rooms with many features was the pitch, with many great offers including a $200 dinner and other great perks.\n\nArrived at the hotel only to learn that our reservations were cancelled by Casablanca Express.  No written notice.  Said they tried to reach me three separate times by phone, something that was disconnected last May.  Never an email, never a response to my phone messages that I left for them.  How do they getaway with cancelling something I paid for?  How can a Vegas Hotel allow a \""scam\"" reservation group to do this to them --- THEY BOTH WILL NOT BE USED, or VISITED IN THE FUTURE!\n\nAn ATTORNEY GENERAL in Nevada should do something about these type of organizations.  Enough said.  I am done venting.  I will chalk this up to the worst experience, and one I will always remember when dealing with future offers.  They aren't worth it!"
0,"I was very excited to try Ramsay's food, as I've been a television fan for a long time.  We ordered Ice water with lemon, and only received ice water.  We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer; the homemade ranch was delicious, and the chipotle ketchup was ok, at best.  The onion rings were quite greasy, although seasoned well.  For the main course, we ordered the \""Farmer's Burger\"" (I can't fully remember the name, but it was a burger with duck bacon and an egg on top) ( I would rate this burger alone a 3.5), the \""Hells Kitchen Burger\"", and the Truffle Fries with Truffle Aioli.  The hells kitchen burger was charred so badly on the bottom that I could taste nothing but burnt, and had absolutely no seasoning.  The burger had roasted jalepeno, tomato, and avacado on top of a cheese I cannot remember the name of.  We had a shift change mid service, so the new waiter took a while to catch on that the burger was sitting there untouched.  We advised him that not only was it charred, there was NO seasoning whatsoever.  He brought back a less cooked burger, but with no seasoning still.  To have roasted vegetables with raw (thickly cut) avacado on top with NO salt was a slap in the culinary world's face.  The only salt was from the cheese, which you could taste in the last bite (as all the toppings were eaten already.)  I would never go back, and will never eat at a Ramsay restaurant again.  To \""rectify\"" the issue with yet another unseasoned burger told me that it was intended to be bland.  No thanks, for over $50 I could have eaten three times the amount at In N Out burger and been completely satisfied!  (Oh yes, the fries were ok, more garlicy than truffley...but the meal cannot be held up by the fries.)"
1,Great customer service.  Always get you in and out as quickly as possible.   Employees are on top of issues and polite.
0,"I'm going to agree with my friend, Shawn J.\n\nI am old enough to remember when Thirty Ice Cream was located in the now defunct Thrifty Drug Stores. It was a \""loss leader\"" charging 5 cents for a single, 10 cents, for a double, and 15 Cents for a tripple. \n\nThe quality was really low back then, but so were the prices. \n\nNow, I did not expect to find the same prices, but for the poor quality, I did expect it to be less then 31 Flavors, and Cold Stone. Not the case.\n\nThis Ice Cream is not in the same class with Ben & Jerry's, Hagen Daz, 31 Flavors, or even the Bryer's you get at the store. The scoops are generous, but the low quality does not justify their prices.\n\nMy wife and I shared a double waffle cone of Coffee and Strawberry Ice Cream. A real waste of \""cheat\"" calories on my diet.  \n\nMy suggestion; go up or down the street to Albertson's or Von's, spend $4 on a pint of B&Js, Hagen Daz, or something you really like, and go home and enjoy it.  Your taste buds and your wallet will both thank you."
1,What a wonderful experience! I have been jumping from dentist to dentist for the last 5 years. I am happy to say I have found a place to stay!
0,"Their service is comparable to the local hole in the wall, and my local Chinese place has better tasting food (MSG anyone?). I truly felt like I was in main land China since, none of their staff members spoke English properly (except for the hostess). \n\nOverall the food was mediocre, though the spare ribs were pretty good but the services and food were overly priced. It would have been nice to have a full bar instead of being told that we should go across the hall to Emeril's ..."
1,"I was first introduced to Green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by Green and later visited the Scottsdale Road location.  This was over 2 years ago.  Soon after, I learned that Green was opening a location just down the street from my home in Phoenix.  This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  I have yet to try everything on the menu.  The service is always friendly, the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean.  If you Like Green on Facebook, you can stay up to date with the specials that Green has to offer and at which location."
1,"fancy fancy. i love fancy food i love fancy restaurants. we made reservations here on a friday night and decided to order the tasting menu and added foie gras cause who doesnt love that?! add in a bottle of wine and your dinner is now expensive but delicious. \n\nthe annoying part was that valet was not complimentary but was $13! once you enter, they have a closet for your jackets so that's nice. \n\nthe food itself was delicious and the presentation fantastic. but it just wasn't one of the best that i've been to. the service was good. we had a few. one was very descriptive and answered all our questions. some were just hard to understand :( and when youre at a fancy restaurant i like to know what im eating\n\nmenu degustation - $92 each \nfoie gras degustation - addt'l $12 each \nbaron louis bottle of red wine - $80"
1,I had a great cupping and deep tissue massage with Elliot. He was very professional and listened to what I wanted him to work on. The atmosphere was very soothing and it smelled fantastic. The price is cheap considering the care and great service. I'm planning on being a regular customer!
1,"I do 97% of my families shopping here. I love the bakery that this location has! Some of their prepared meals are better then others just like any store. The Indian ones are actually quite good for Indian on the go. The meat  and their cheese selection is always awesome. The staff at this store are great, they are always friendly and helpful."
1,"I have to say that I love the burgers at Red Robin.  They have a great selection and come with unlimited fries.  I like the burgers so much that I never tried anything else, however, my wife loves the whiskey river barbecue chicken wrap.  They also have a lettuce wrap burger that my wife gets sometimes to keep carbs down.\n\nThe service is a little hit or miss.  It is usually pretty good, but not great.  This is especially true if you get seated in the bar area in my experience.\n\nRed Robin is one of our regular places to go because of the reasonable prices and great burgers.  BEWARE - Tuesday night is kids night!"
1,"This place is absolutely amazing. From the authentic Italian food to the home made lemoncello, it's my favorite place in Phoenix. Just do it. No joke, just do it"
1,"Again, we've been on an epic sushi expedition since moving here, trying to find GOOD sushi in Phoenix.  So far, the best has been Sushi on Shea in Scottsdale. However, friends recommended Stingray, so off we went.\n\nNow, we are definitely not this trendy. No Sir.  We felt quite a bit out of place, and while I did like most of the decor (walking over fish looking up my skirt was a bit awkward), some of it was too much. Also, the hostesses wore nothing to differentiate them; it was like being in the emo-ville section of ASU.\n\nStepping in, we waited a good 5 minutes before we were sat. Once sat, our server took her time coming over too. Between the initial service and the prices, we were pretty unimpressed. Also, the lack of vegetarian sushi options was kind of disappointing.\n\nHowever, the food, once ordered, was delicious. The iced tea was super tasty, and my partner got a crunchy roll and a spicy salmon roll.  She said both were the freshest she's tasted since we moved here.  Due to the lack of veggie-friendly sushi options, I opted for the Udon soup with a soy broth. Granted, it came out about 10 minutes after my partner's sushi did, but it was worth it. Veggies, noodles and a DELICIOUS broth made it well worth the $12, and I was definitely full.\n\nWill we come back? Yes, but not too frequently. The pricing is a bit high, and we're way too un-trendy for such a place, so Sushi on Shea will be our go to, affordable place. However, for a once in a while date night sushi place, Stingray will top the list."
0,"Their was no line when we went on a Friday night...and the price for two plus two drinks was like robbery. We weren't offered a photo-op as we walked past the photo area. The two photo guys were too busy talking to each other that we were ignored. When we were at the boarding area, the attendant frantically waive you to hurry up and jump on board the moving pod.  The ride is slow moving and the monitors that are inside are blaring loud and obnoxious. Maybe they need to change the voice to be more pleasant than \""infomercial yelling\"". The views were nice at night and made for great pictures of the strip. But beware that if your cabin is full, it'll be hard to grab window space in your pod for photos...there was only 10 ppl in ours and it was a struggle.  Overall, it's an expensive ride."
0,This place has sure changed...and not for the better. they totally re-did the menu and got rid of many yummy things they used to serve.\nThere are still the desserts but the little sliders are off the menu and those were my favorite!\nSo I bring my little guy here for a little dinner & chocolate treat. Our server tells me she is also a mom and whatnot. Ok lady..lets get this this started...I am with a 2 year old. I might be crazy but when the server says she is a parent I expect them to understand & TRY to be quick with things.\nThis girl was not quick..she was very very slow.\nFinally when the food arrived his grilled mac & cheese was cold. Thankfully he did not care. She offered to take it back and warm it up but there was no way he was going to go for that. He was hungry.\nWe finally order the chocolate pizza for dessert after waiting way to long for her to come back and check on us.\nThe pizza of course takes forever & I am trying to keep my kid from climbing the walls. Once it gets there tho my kiddo is in heaven. He tore into that pizza. He was in heaven. He was dancing in his chair...singing Yum Yum in my belly. It was awesome. And for that they should get 5 stars. But when I factor everything in they are down to 2 stars. Sorry Max..Prob wont be coming back again.
1,"When you first come into the area it seems to be in a kinda sketchy but once you get inside it's BEAUTIFUL!  Very High Class.  I felt like the richest man in all of Las Vegas.  We used a living social coupon for the place and I dare say we'll do it again.  \n\nOnce you check-in and pay there are 2 different locker rooms, male and female.  Connected to those locker rooms are showers, hot and cold jacuzzi pools, steam saunas, and salt saunas (my wife said the women's side had an herbal sauna; I didn't find one in the men's).  \n\nThe second level has 3 different heat sauna rooms: clay ball room, adobe clay room, jade and eucalyptus room, and an ice room. There is also a yoga room and a little restaurant. You could probably spend all day going in and out of the rooms.  They also offer massages, for a fee.  We didn't get the couples massage 'cause we're cheap, but everything else is amazing.  \n\nAll the patrons there were very nice and talkative, as were the workers.  If you need a day to relax and sweat out all the toxins, this is your place.  I plan on going back again and again.  I would have given 5 stars but the messages were pretty pricey.  Other than that great experience."
0,"Definitely the worst gel manicure I've had. The technician didn't even bother to scrape all of the old gel off, didn't soak my cuticles or push them back, and when i pointed out several times that there was something wrong with one of them, she ignored me. I've never broken a nail within 2 weeks of a gel manicure, and I've broken 3 within a week of this botched job, and most of the other nails have gel pulling up at the edges.\n\nWon't be wasting my money here anymore."
0,"I got myt first pair of orthotics with this place back in 2001. Back then, I felt like a valued client, and they almost had me believe that they were foot specialists or podiatrists. I paid a little over $100 for two pairs.\nHowever, I visited the same location yesterday and explained that I could not find my inserts so I bought the shoes instead paying $600 for what I had purchased once a long time ago. Yet the shoes were still $130.00. I specifically asked for slip-resistant shoes and felt like being at a roller rink passing through the kitchen. \nI returned this morning, and the male attendant with a feux hawk decided to quote manufacturer's words to me when I tried to return the shoes, or exchange them within 2 sentences of our conversation.\nSo if it wasn't for their overpriced and prescribed inserts not from someone who has a degree in sports medicine, it would be for the careless treatment I received that I am submitting a low but generous score to the only surviving location in Clark County.\nI should add that female that I initially bought products from yesterday, was polite but said that their products would last 5 to 8 months at best, which is piss poor for $130.00."
1,"Stayed here over the weekend since my friend and I saw Nine Inch Nails at the Hard Rock hotel which is directly across the street. That was the main reason why we stayed here. Close, convenient and couldn't beat the price for sure which was $65 a night. \n\nWe got there around 10pm. No one was in line to check in so we were in and out of there quick. No issues with check in.\n\nOur room was clean although it kind of had a smell to it but it wasn't bothersome. There's no ventilation what-so-ever. All the windows are bolted shut and no vents in the restrooms to air out the steam. There are remote controlled AC/heaters though. The lighting is kind of poor throughout the entire room, including the bedrooms. It's easier in the day time if you want more light but at night it kind of sucked. Oh and there's no stereo so bring your own jams.\n\nIt's not too far from the strip either which is cool. I think this may be the place I'll stay at next time I'm in Vegas."
0,"I booked this thru the online website of Paradise Found Tours which links to Grand Canyon Tour & Travel for $80 a person for the South Rim bus tour.  You can have them drop you off and pick you up on another day but that would require you purchasing 2 tickets.\nWe got picked up on a smaller bus and taken to planet hollywood to check in and get our bottle of water, coffee and small danish for breakfast.\nOur bus driver Earl was very rude and not at all friendly.  He determines who gets to sit where and was the bus Nazi.  I understand we are on a time crunch but he could have been more nice or bring on a tour guide that would be nice.\n1st stop was at hoover dam for a 10 min break and picture taking opt.\n2nd stop was at a truck stop with a Subways in Kingman City.\n3rd stop was a buffet lunch.  They sat us with another set of people so we would fill up the table of 4.\nThen we got to the Grand Canyon and made 2 stop was at two view points.  Each stop we were given 1 hour and was threaten they would leave us if we are not back.  They left 2 people at the first stop.  He dropped us off at the 2nd stop and went back to get the people left behind.\nAt lunch he was yelling at a single international guy that probably did not understand him very well.  They were missing 2 people and the guy walked on the bus by himself.  He was yelled off the bus to find his friend.  Then another girl on the bus spoke up that her friend was not there and then the guy was let on the bus.  Then the bus driver yelled at the lady for being late and told her to stick to her friend from now on.\nVery rude bus driver.  We did not get the 3 hours as promised on the website.  It said we get picked up later than other tour companies but they made us wait at the stop at 5:45 but didn't pick us up until 6:10am.  Then we went to pick up a bus full of people from other places.  At the end, even though we passed by downtown Fremont they did not let us get off first and dropped us off last again.  \nOver 10 hours trip to see the grand canyon for 2 hours and have a rude driver, don't do it.  Find a better company without the false advertisements."
0,"Just came back from a bad meal at Namos.  Aside from the fact that it took a full 45 minutes to get our main course, the waiter screwed up. For health reasons, I asked for no salt or other spices on my steak. The kitchen ignored my request. I could not eat it. My choice was to give it to my wife or send it back and wait another 45 minutes for my meal  I chose the first and went away unsatisfied and unhappy. \n\nThat is it for me at Namos."
1,"My boyfriend and I came here for an early Valentine's Day dinner and everything was perfect! \nI ordered the vegan marsala and it was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the pollo and he really liked that as well. \n\nMy boyfriend is not one to gush over a restaurant, but he said that he will now always want to go back to Sinatra whenever he is in Vegas and that I picked a good spot! \n\nSo, yes...it's a little pricey, but it's Vegas. It can be expected. \n\nFood and service were both great!"
0,I'm not a fan.  Pretty average burrito.
1,"I've been coming to this place for years. I've been to the old location and now at the new one which is closer to the strip. The new one is so much bigger and nicer. A BIG thank you to the owner(s) for doing this for those of us that grew up playing pinball.\n\nAnyone who loves pinball will be in heaven at this place. It's great fun and where else can $5 last you for hours. I've from the Bay Area and always visit at least once during each visit to Vegas. \n\nOn my last few visits I've noticed a few things that put me off a bit. Several of the machines are not working or those that are have poor flipper issues (which really impacts your game). I don't see the \""hippy guy\"" that I saw years ago there fixing machines (so maybe that is why so many are down). However, if you want to play some of the newer machines, this is the place as they have a great selection of both new and old.\n\nAnd sadly, it's pretty messy in there and the bathroom is pathetic. It would be great if they had a display that talks about the history of pinball and a nice cafe or coffee joint. There is plenty of room for one. Actually, this place needs to move to a dedicated location on the strip (inside one of the strip hotels). It could be a real museum and would be accessible to so many more visitors. I know I'm dreaming here but how cool would that be. It would save a drive or cab from the strip.\n\nIn short, this place is great fun but it does need some improvement. With some more investment in the physical appearance of the place, a cafe, exhibit and staff to fix all the broken games, it could be amazing.\n\nThe PG&E bill must be really high here. The machines suck the power and put out some heat. That, along with the A/C constantly running in the summer -- wow.  I can only imagine what it costs to actually power this place."
0,"I had breakfast, and didn't eat much. Enough said. I thought this was a high end casino, but it falls short big time in this joint!"
0,"I have tried to build my own burger, and even tried one of the featured Wagyu burgers.  As far as burger's go, it might be that I just haven't hit the right combination yet, but 5 Guys has a tastier burger by far with much less effort in combining such varied toppings.  There are MANY (possibly too many) choices for toppings.  Some of them don't make sense (poblano peppers AND roasted reds?), some of them are pleasant surprises (fire roasted tomatoes).  The rubs don't add much variance from one to the next.\n\nWhere Burgatory shines is their fries, house-made oils that they use for toppings  on the fries, nachos, and burgers, and their milk shakes are the best I've EVER had.  Granted, I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but I am 38 years old, and I've had my share of milk shakes.\n\nHonestly, the local hype hurts the restaurant in my opinion.  Wait times for a table exceed 1 hour from 3-4pm onward (I've never been there earlier than 3pm.)  The wait certainly builds expectations.  If you allow this to happen unchecked, you'll likely be disappointed as there isn't much special about Burgatory's food.\n\nOne positive is the staff at the Waterworks location (the only one I've been to).  I have never had a server that seems put out by their job.  They've always been free with suggestions (when asked), attentive, and seemingly caring about your experience.\n\nSo...if you're impressed by sheer selection, quality presentation, decent beef, and hype, Burgatory is for you.  If you want a good burger, don't try so hard.  Stick with the basics and try 5 Guys or even Mario's on the South Side."
0,"I don't think I could ever eat burger again, thanks to Bachi Burger.  I ordered the black and green, Wagyu beef, medium rare.  It did go down good, but at 2:30 AM, it then came back up.  I couldn't keep anything down, even water, for 24 hours, and had to cancel a business trip as a result.  \n\nI'm trying to figure out what was it that made me so sick?  The beef, the blue cheese, the spinach.Or did someone not wash their hands?   I will never know but this experience was one of those defining moments. If I ever muster the courage to eat a burger again,  no more medium rare burgers for me,"
1,"If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine, VinciTorio's is a must try. My roommate, who lived in Italy for a year, says that their food is the real thing. No diets allowed here.\n\nTheir Burrata e Pere is a great starter mixing sweet and salty with a combination of cream cheese and pears wrapped in proscuitto. My favorite dish is their Agnolotti Carbonara, which is ravioli stuffed with chicken and sausage in a cream sauce, topped with bacon. Like I said, be prepared to have a real meal here. \n\nThe owners are visible on most nights and have pictures of their trips to Italy up for customers to view. The wait can be longer on weekend nights, but they have an excellent patio and bar to enjoy a glass of wine while you wait. \n\nAdditionally, the wait staff is incredibly patient and friendly. My friends and I have closed down this place on quite a few occasions and have never been met with an impatient waiter trying to shove us out the door."
0,Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up.
1,"To me this is steak paradise!\n\nThe hubby and I make it a must everytime we go to Las Vegas, the vibe is very nice with a modern twist, and nice music... as an gets you ready for the party, but not too loud at the same time.\n\nThe food ... haaaaa the steaks are amazing and so are the lobster tails!\n\nI tried the surf and turf on one occasion which was decadent, and the bone in filet on the most recent visit: THE BONE IN FILET IS TO DIE FOR! a 16oz. piece of heaven, a true foodgasm!\n\nThe sides are to be shared, and we love their lemon butter asparagus and the \""party in your mouth\"" lobster mashed potatoes... so decadent and with huge chunks of lobster. \n\nDessert: we tried the mini doughnuts with 4 diferent dipping sauces: Dark, Milk and White chocolate... and if you are good they also give you the caramel penut butter crunch sauce! YUM AND YUM!\n\nDo make a reservation, highly suggested!"
0,"We stayed here for a week, rooms have old nasty furniture and 70's carpet, wifi never worked,  you can't even walk in or out of the hotel without getting mobbed by venders and vacation time share sales people. It got so bad by the end of the trip that I just wanted to punch them in the face. Our reservation was for a smoking room with a strip view. When we checked in we were told the only way we could have a strip view was in a no smoking room, and we would have to downgrade the room.   It took 20 min on hold just to get the front desk several times. I finally just hung up. We will NEVER stay in this hotel again. It's the most Getto  hotel on the strip."
0,"Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles, salt, and water. No milk or cheese. Not made with love. Food made with HATE. Im so sorry the owner died. Should have taken this so called restaurant with him. I should have known the food was gonna be bad because of the bad service!!! Floyds food does not taste nearly as good as mine. Reply to my post and i will sell a real recipe for collards and real macaroni and cheese. Oh, the location milton road food excellent!! Holla at me or them to learn how to cook!!!"
1,"Very impress of this new restaurant inside SLS Las Vegas; Contemporary and quite chic Tapas style.  Decor is tasty and elegantly put together; Service was pretty good as well. The dishes are perfectly proportioned and delicious...  Watermelon & Feta Avocado, Spiced Nuts, Cucumber salad is a must; don't forget their assorted Hummus and their oyster too. Their pita bread was freshly baked and it was perfect.\n\nCant wait to go back; someday.  Definitely will recommend to anyone planning to visit Vegas.  Glad that we got to try this during our visit."
1,My sales person was very knowledgable and respectful. I am very happy with Verizon and their service. Overall nice experience at this corporate owned location. Thank you!
0,"Don't go here expecting much. It's really just not very good. My mom said her yellow curry lacked flavor, too many onions and was very runny. I got the kung pao chicken lunch special, barely any chicken, just mostly the other stuff they make it with, and a couple scraps of chicken mixed in. Tasted okay, but just disappointing all around. I did like the thai tea though."
1,"Tasting Menu!\n\nGo for the tasting menu (they will ad hoc a wine pairing if you ask) and go for a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen/prep area.\n\nunique and flavorful, memorable dining, but relaxed atmosphere.  Exceptional meal and we have had it many times, never disappointed."
1,"I never could have pulled of my photo shoot in my mothers dress without Jaime! She is just simply amazing! I loved her so much, I am having her do my makeup for wedding and my entire bridal party! Hire her! She rocks!"
1,This is probably the place you should eat in Vegas. the price are a fraction  of what you would pay to eat at other places. 3 appetizers 3 main courses and the bill comes out way less than eating 2 entrees inside one of the 17 fancy hotels.\n\nThe food is pretty decent. friendly service. attentive. tons of seats.
1,"Ok so I read the other reviews about the carne asada and the california burrito.  I recently got back from San Diego (I know how you SD people are all about your mexican food) and had enjoyed my first \""California Burrito\""! the one I got there had french fries in it.  So I just rolled over to Polibertos.  Theirs has potatoes they did however sub the potatoes for fries and it was a good burrito. The burrito was 4.50!  So even though they don't make it with french fries and they are close to the house and I can get one for under 5 bucks. 4 stars and I'll be back."
0,"Ok, I have read other posts that ran into the same issues that I did here. The food was average but it may have been better if I could have got what I wanted. It is not that they got my order wring, but they ran out of some of the things I wanted. I get that it was dinner time and people had been in there all day, but you have to know when you are running out of guacamole (which is $1.50 anyway), and find a way to get more.\nIt wasn't just the guacamole that they were out of, they also somehow ran out of brown rice.\n\nI ended up going with a cilantro lime rice, which was good, but again not what I wanted. Over all I feel like I got a bunch of beans, ok amount of chicken, no guacamole, and a secondary kind of rice. \n\nI don't come here often and this is not the way to get me going back."
0,"Wow...really??\n\nNo, that's not a good wow. That's a \""I paid that much for this\"" wow. If I'm being perfectly honest, I was not impressed at all. That being said, I went in with an open mind and empty stomach. Ya know, everything is supposed to taste better when you're hungry. Nah. It really didn't.\n\nService was great. From the beginning to the end. The host was polite and pulled our party of four through the long-ish line and sat us quickly [no, we aren't VIP...though at times that would be awesome]. The waitress[?] was quick to clean our empty plates and refill our beverages. I'm hesitant to call her a waitress because she wasn't really waiting on us. But regardless, she was good.\n\nThe food was ehhhhhhhh. I've really experienced better back home [in Chicago] and definitely paid less [we went for lunch]. The selection was limited; it is \""multicultural,\"" but there were only like two or three dishes per cuisine, and there weren't many different types of cuisine.\n\nI left a underwhelmed and way too full [I tried to get my moneys worth]. I'm curious to how different dinner is compared to their lunch. Hmm. Is it worth the risk? Try it yourself and message me. I'd be interested in your take on what was once revered as the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of LV."
0,"Such a disappointment.  My wife and I are huge Beatles fans.  We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance.  This did not live up to expectation. There were three \""stunts\"" that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that.  It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that."
0,"Went in not expecting too much, and if you do that, it's not bad, although still pricey.\n\nWe stopped in because we were late to watch one of the world cup games and needed to grab a quick breakfast. I got the two eggs breakfast and my wife got just two eggs. \n\nThe food was decent: eggs were done ok, sausage was fine, toast was good. The hash browns, however, arrived in a sort of \""brick\"" and were greasy and rather tasteless.  I presume they came frozen in that shape and had just been tossed in the deep fryer. Coffee was ok and they left the carafe.  \n\nThe one major negative I must mention is that I didn't realize how expensive the coffee was until we got the bill.  $3.95 per cup for coffee!  If I'm paying four dollars a cup for coffee, there had better be liquor in there.  I realized the rest of the meal was going to be pricey, but this was a bit much."
1,"My hubby and I love Yard House especially for their late night happy hour. It's super-chill and a fun place to hang out for a couple hours. Their menu is massive and have yet to have something that we don't like. Especially love the ahi tuna app as well as the pizzas (margherita and pineapple/ham). Last time we were in my husband could not remember which Amber beer he had the last time we were there. The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive. The servers and bartenders have genuine personalities, but are not overbearing. I also like the semi-open kitchen where you can see back of house staff working. Yard House is one of my favorite go-to places to grab a beer/wine and a tasty little snack."
1,"This visit received a prompt greeting by the hotess/manager after efficient service, food in a timely manner, and as we ordered it. Restrooms were well kempt. And as Forrest Gump says...\""that's all I got ta say about that.\"""
1,"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 1/4 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.\n\nI usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!\n\nTip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too."
1,"If you are in the mood for old school ribs, this is the place to be. Everything is original there. Everything. Well, minus the TVs, which are on the Carolina News channel and not blaringly loud. Everything is quite tasty, but the hush puppies are crazy good. The sweet tea is sugar coma inducing and one of my favorites in the Queen City. You do not leave hungry. I ate all the ribs on my plate, the hush puppies, and a half gallon of tea. I took home the chicken and fries for another filling meal at a later date. It's a shame the place is such a drive for me. Will be back."
0,"I went to Gus's once and haven't been back. There was loud electronic music playing the whole time, so it was really hard to talk. I had the sloppy joe, which was good, but overpriced seeing that no side came with it. Just a really weird experience."
1,"This place has been haunting me forever. Driving past it all the time and teasing me with it's sign and red awning. This place is kinda a hole in the wall. I don't really wanna give away the experience. But you should make reservations if you go on a weekend. It definitely is a possibility it may be crowded - It opens at 5pm till late night. \nOk so here's the deal without giving away the experience. You walk in and .............. We'll skip ahead to eating there - it definitely is worth it though. Funny thing is that I was reading over some past reviews and either people had a great time here or it REALLY Sucked. Sometimes restaurants go through staffing issues...But definitely had a good time here. Just remember to \""speak easy\"" if you know what I mean!\nThe ambiance is dark and romantic. With an old Vegas feel to it. It's got these private booths and family tables. We got the Bugsy Segal Booth. There's a guy walking around singing old Rat Pack/Chicago -Italian style songs from \""That's Amore\"" - \""Ain't that a kick in the head. \nThe service was friendly from EVERYONE! The decor is kinda Mob-like. The food was pretty good almost home cooked. The pasta I had was \""Swim with Fishes\"" or something like that had a light cheese cream sauce with garlic and sundried tomatoes swimming in al dente fettucinni and shrimp.  \""Bust a cap\"" stuffed mushrooms were fantastic - sure they were little mushrooms but they did pack it with flavor. The italian egg drop soup was good. Very garlicky but a little salty for me. When they say garlic mashed potatoes...they don't mess around.\nGARLIC!!!!\nThey had this chicken too kinda with picatta sauce and capers but it had broccoli. This thing was packed with flavor.\nOk so great ambiance,  great date place, friendly staff, good food. Definitely wanna come back!"
1,"Ok, this is a little premature from me, but I know that Brandon is waiting for this review. I made the mistake of mentioning Yelp when I sat down, so he was on top of his game. It reminded me of an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun...\n\nAnyway, I say this is premature because, although I have been to Blanco twice now, I have only had drinks and apps, and I don't feel I know enough to write a full review.\n\nThat being said, Brandon rocks. The Blood Orange marg that he suggested was tasty. A second one may have knocked me on my butt, but the alcohol was well hidden. I ordered the guacamole and is was creamy and chunky and delicious (also full of monounsaturated fats- hooray!). My friend ordered the Three Cheese Quesadilla with chicken. She liked that too.\n\nI would like to go back for more margaritas and maybe an order of the fish tacos. And the flan.\n\nShout out to Brandon."
1,"If the main casino isn't quiet enough for you (though that's unlikey!), head upstairs to this sports bar. There is gaming at the bar and a nice selection of draft beer. There are also tables for easy viewing of the many TVs. You must try the $1 cheese pizza slices, which are only available when the kitchen is open (weekends only unless during game season I think). The pizza is great!"
0,"YUCK!!!! I feel sick just writing this review. Yelpers you have let me down. The food was downright rotten (literally,) my Cali Omelette smelled and tasted rotten. I don't know if the egg or cheese were old or artificial. The home potatoes lacked seasoning and were extremely bland. I only ate a couple of bites and sent it back. I refused to reorder anything else, I just didn't trust this place after that. My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and the Cinnamon Roll and he enjoyed them. I had a couple of bites of the Cinnamon Roll and it reminded me of the fake Pillsbury Dough rolls. Not a Fan!!! :( If I need a Breakfast fix, I will go elsewhere."
1,"Big store with organized racks of clothing, good book section, and lots of choices to make. If you make a donation, you will get a coupon for 20% off your purchase over $10.00. Since I am always going through my closet, I usually will have a bag to donate. On mondays, there is a color tag that is chosen and is 50% off. On holidays, everything in the store is 50% off- expect a long line. Boutique, cashiers, donation bin, & dressing rooms are in front. Books (and other media), house wares, womens clothing in the middle of the store. Men's clothing, furniture, bags, and shoes are in back. I usually find books (nothing over $2.99), clothing and other items like Partylite candles and accessories. I found a Tignello leather bag in near mint condition here. The boutique bag/jewelry section is over-inflated (priced $120 and up)- you can go to the outlet store and get a new designer bag for way less than that. Still, I'd rather go here than Goodwill (less organized, higher priced)."
0,"Terrible spring training facility. Bad food, seats all the sun, no cup holders. Many better stadiums around greater Phoenix area. Employees are rude and make the experience uninviting."
1,"Wow!!  This was amazing!!! It was such a unique fun experience that really made my vacation. \n\n  They come and pick you up if you need a way to get there, and both the instructors are very friendly, experienced, and fun which made the experience that much greater. You learn tricks, change up speeds, and ride over a multitude of terrains it was AMAZING!\n\n  I really didn't know what to expect but I can say it was better than anything I could of imagine. Thanks for the great time, I am definitely going to come by again!"
0,"Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it."
0,"Roku is to sushi as \""The Golden Child\"" is to Eddie Murphy movies -- far closer to the bottom than the top.\nRoll selection was weak, and construction was worse. Having said that, their crab dynamite was delicious."
1,This location Rocks! The staff (both front and back of house) know what they are doing - which is very refreshing these days. Just wish it wasn't overrun w/ so many loud kids. Thanks Gilbert location for holding true to Pita Jungle's standards!
0,"There's a lot of bashing (and some defending) of this shop on backpage so I decided to see for myself and pay LnL a visit. Instead of writing a review I will instead copy/paste a copy of the email I sent them after my visit which they never responded to.\n\n          I'm not mad and this isn't a complaint but I came to the store last night to look at the CAI C93 and had a question about the warranty, the salesman said the warranty starts at the time of purchase but I heard (youtube) it actually begins from the day CAI ships the firearm. I didn't get to see anything in writing or even handle the firearm so I just left to go home and do more research. I found this (below) on the CAI website, I'm also interested in perhaps the CAI AK-74 and the GLOCK 22 and was thinking if I purchased all three then perhaps we could make a deal. However I did notice your GLOCK'S are considerably more than other shops by about $100.\n\n                                      NEW WARRANTY POLICY\n \n2) All firearms/receivers sold as \""new\"", or manufactured/assembled by Century have (1) year repair/\n\nreplacement warranty from the day the firearm/receiver was shipped from Century's warehouse to the\n\ncustomer, unless noted otherwise.

0,"I am what you would consider a mexican food snob. Small, hole in the wall type places are what i live for. \n\nI had the mini chimis (5) with beans and rice... Cost me $10 which is a little steep for me especially given the quality of food. \n\nThe chimis had cream cheese and beef in them. More cream cheese than beef. They were sweet. Almost tasted like they were made with a flaky pastry dough or something. The rice was nothing special but their refried beans were delicious. I wish i would have had the option to get chicken ones. \n\nTheir salsa bar salsas were nothing special to me, flavorless.  Their avocado + salsa verde one was pretty unique and delicious though. \n\nThe restraunt was super clean and a little over the top friendly. Im from the south and enjoy being greeted with a smile, but 4 different times while i am trying to eat? Overkill. \n\nThey have a fried ice cream milkshake that i would love to try! I might go back to try that, but that's about it. This place definitely isn't Carolina's/los dos melinos status."
1,"Unlike the last review I wrote about an unconventional outlet mall, Outlets At Anthem is EXACTLY what you'd think of when you think 'Outlet Mall'. It is one mammoth of a shopping center and it doesn't matter WHO you are - you will mos' def.' find *something* that catches your eye in any one of the multiple stores (total understatement) located in this complex.\n\nWhether you're looking for Gap, BCBG, Banana Republic, Book Warehouse, Calvin Klein, Bose, Claire's, Kitchen Collection, Jockey, Polo, Perfumania, Ultra Diamonds, Vans, or Yogurberry (JUST TO NAME A FEW), the Outlets At Anthem have got you covered.\n\nBeing the avid swimmer that I am, I hit up the Nike Factory store and bought two (count 'em) TWO Nike swimsuits for $60. Usually one runs me about $75. Can I get a holllllllaaaa?!?!?!?\n\nThe only reason I *had* to take off a star is because this is an outdoor outlet mall, and in a place like Arizona, that is INSANE. The weather was SO scorching hot that I would have PAID an entry fee to shop at an indoor, AIR CONDITIONED shopping complex.\n\nAh well, still got the goods at the outlet prices. Can't complain...too much ;)"
0,Eek - If you are considering getting married here I would bring in your own Wedding Planner who is a Professional ! The lady running this is extremely rude and does not work well with families or vendors !   USually when you are a planner at a venue you solve problems and dont just shrug you shoulders and ay oh well ! -
0,"This review is only for the seafood department in the store.\n\nI'm not an idiot, I realize that trying to buy fresh seafood in the Phoenix area is not one of the greatest ideas one could have, but I live in Boston and make my living as a fish monger/fish cook.  So I know about fish, and my family was hoping that i would cook for them while I'm out here.\n\nThis place was a fail as soon as I walked to the counter.  The shell fish were all kept on plates above the ice and I noticed that several mussels and clams had already opened.\n\nNot only should shell fish be kept directly on ice, part way buried in the stuff is best, and if you loose a few in the process of the day you take them out of the case and dispose of the them.  Not leave them out for everyone to see that your not keeping your seafood cold and just letting it go south.  You may as well keep it out side in the trunk of your car.  Spoiled seafood is spoiled seafood.  I don't care if you do put it on a shiny platter and put a \""sale\"" sticker on it.\n\nI ended up having to make do with some frozen flounder, I brought them home and thawed them out, only to find they were SATURATED with water, I actually had to hold them over the sink and gently squeeze water out of them.  In the years I've worked with all manner of fish, I've never actually had wring a fish dry like it was some sort of towel.   \n\nHonest to god, I twisted the ends until the fillets started to curl, then they started realizing an truly unusual amount of fluids.  It was disgusting."
1,Nice bar! We came here for beers but there are games and good looking food. We would definitely come here again. Good music too!!
1,"this place was great. the prices were right and the sanwich was fantastic. i wasn't even shit faced either, so i can tell you for sure. its a little heavy on the sodium, but what isn't?\n\ni found this place by accident while looking for a liquor store and damn i'm glad i did. if they had this in LA i would go once a week at least. \n\nthe american turkey is incredible. hook it UP!!!!!"
1,"I've never had a better massage and I've had too many to count over my 57 years.\nAmma is fabulous. It was not like anything I've ever experienced.  Almost like a Yoga massage, if there is such a thing. Amma seems to instinctively know where to push and pull and move you to make your whole body relax.  Can't wait to go back to her!"
1,"Tried Bad Beat on 08/09/14 and was not disappointed. Husband and I ordered two samplers which included a total of 6 beers for a mere $10 each. I love how they have the listing of beers and ingredients on the tables so you know exactly what you're drinking. This sampler was a perfect way to try a few beers and rile up our appetite just in time to walk out to the parking lot and grab some food off the food truck that was parked right by the front door. \nThis is an awesome and welcome addition to Henderson. Especially in a more commercial and not very busy part of Henderson. We are already looking forward to going back and having some more beers. I will have the delicious Heffeweizen with the subtle banana flavor and the husband loved their Ace in the Hole, which we found out can be purchased at a local Henderson shop! \nWelcome to town Bad Beat and best of luck to you guys!!"
0,"I gave them 1 star cause I have to do it ti write this review, to start I just want to say please do not ever go to this place I mean not only is poor customer service but poor quality omg I can't even think on anything else but worst nail job I have ever had in my life, I can't understand how ppl like this is still in business, this place should be closed down I can see now why some ppl post in here saying they got an infection by getting a pedicure with that been said go at your risk at the end of all is your nails. I do recommend a different place were they fix the awful job they did  TIFFANYS NAIL SALON at  29th and Dunlap they do and amazing job and made my nails look beautiful again."
0,$9 for a sandwich only. It was not worth it.
0,Worse buffet experience in Vegas.. Usually you can never go wrong with buffets in Vegas.. this was a bad choice. \n\nFood section.. quality was bad.. overpriced.. \n\nNever come here again.
0,"Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours."
0,"I usually love Paradise Bakery but this location is the worst.  I agree with Ken B.  this is the worst location ever.  My complaint is specifically with they way the smaller counter is handled, the one that you would most likely visit in the morning for a muffin and coffee.  The staff doesn't listen to you when you order they are too busy paying attention to the \""regulars\"" and just let them interrupt you while your ordering.  Today I ordered a coffee and a muffin, right in the middle a regular walked in and started to ask about the cookie boxes.  The person helping me actually stopped helping me and was going to start answering his questions, meanwhile, I was standing there waiting for my coffee cup and had to remind her!!!!  This location just plain sucks."
1,"I made reservations for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed this place.  Making dinner reservations online was a breeze and the service was phenomenal.  We walked in (15 minutes before our reservation) and were seated immediately.  Within a minute, water and bread was on the table.  Our server was prompt and friendly, while still allowing us enough time to look over the menu.  He checked back often, but not so often as to disrupt the meal.  Our glasses were always full and the food came quickly.  \n\nThe food was pretty good.  We both ordered a side salad and the 12-oz rib eye entree with chipotle caramelized onions, jack cheese potatoes and roasted corn with green chilies.  I really enjoyed the bread (if you don't like garlic, pass on the bread) and we both LOVED the side salad.  The potatoes and corn garnish were both very good and complimented the meal well.  You could see the corn was cut off the cob, and not from a can.  As for the steak, I'm fortunate to have a dad who is a master griller so when I have steak, I'm used to VERY, VERY GOOD steak.  Like, exceptionally good.  The steak here was tender, cooked just like I asked, but just not as flavorful as what I'm used to.  It was good, not great.  8/10.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this place.  The service was good, ambiance the ambiance was nice, and the food met expectations.  We'll definitely come back."
0,"Gave this place a try, but was very disappointed for a \""5 star\"" steakhouse. This \""view of the strip\"" is more like a view of the las vegas strip street from a 3rd story window. There was a lady who would interrupt our dinner time suggesting that we take pictures. The pictures came out looked washed and unprofessional. \n I ordered the filet mignon while my boyfriend had prime rib. The steakhouse's version of \""medium rare\""  is prepared medium well. I was surprised because I was expecting my steak to be \""bloodier\"" on the plate. Also the steaks do not come with side orders, they have to be ordered seperately, for $7-$10 more. Nearly half of the prime rib my boyfriend ordered was fat. For such a nice place we expected at least the prime rib to have a lot less fat on it.\nWon't eat here again and I don't suggest anyone else to."
1,"seems to be a great little venue.  Large selection of beer, could use a few more bathroom stalls, but can't really knock that.  sound is good, acts are fresh, enjoy that that they bring in local's to open.  would love if i could get a slice of pizza or something to nosh on before the show starts.  but those are all minor complaints.  will be back soon, wish more people in charlotte saw live music."
0,"Worst service ever!  11 minutes to get my order inside with only 2 people in  front of me.  They pay attention to the drive through only, and that too looks slow. Dont go here!  They are rude too!"
1,"Thanks Debra for inviting me! Yay!\n\nSo I arrived super early, which is rare, and there were already people ordering their Pad Thai! I met a few other Yelpers and we chatted then went into checking out the food. \n\nI got some pork satay, chicken pad thai (over an hr wait when I ordered at 9am, worth it!), roti, these coconut milk things, some rice pudding dessert, a piece of cake that had coconut in it, and some donut type dessert.\n\nAll of the food I had was totally amazing! I'm usually not one to try new things, Ive turned a new leaf and am going to try many things! Everything was delicious and cooked perfect. The pad thai was yummy, one of my orders had all the seasoning and the other didnt, so I added salt and it tasted great! Now this is the first time I had pad thai, so I dont really have anything to compare it to haha. The roti was yummy and reminded me of tortillas and butter, and the deserts were also light and delicious. My son was in love with the satay!\n\nThe customer service from the different ladies is all pretty good, obviously the language barrier is there but not a huge problem. All the ladies were very nice and helpful!\n\nI would advise if you go get there early then check out the meditation garden!\n\n\nYay!"
0,"I did my research on yelp on vegas buffets prior to arrival.  Since I stayed at the MGM, I thought I'd give The Buffet at Bellagio a try.  \n\ni went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  \n\nMost of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel....  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! \n\nThe flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!! \n\nI guess i have to try all the other shitty buffets in vegas before I'll appreciate the wonders of the buffet at bellagio.  until then it's still 2 stars in my book."
1,"tried this place for the first time today, and i was impressed...\n\nthe place is a little hard to get into though, and i'm sure during a lunch rush it's crazy..\n\ntheir pasta salad is one of the best i've ever had...bowtie noodles, my fav...loaded with green onions so be careful!\n\ni got the bird is the word, which was delicious but lacking a good sauce inside...the pico de gallo was fresh and juicy as was the lettuce..and the wrap was so soft i could sleep on a bed of them...\n\nsuper cute inside."
0,"Worst bar on the strip.  We came to watch the games for March Madness. They have 7 TVs in the bar area all on the same game, and the manager said it was impossible to change even one of the TVs because they were all on a schedule.  Are you kidding me? Don't come here. Bad service, incompetent management, and somehow they ran out of beer by noon."
0,"Like previous reviews, the service sucks and not the greatest areas of town. I usually get the norm for me which is a jcf...this place is always busy and they do have a tendency to skip orders...not the best way to run a business. I guess I'll deal with crummy service vs waiting at a coffee shop."
0,"Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get \"" medium bone out \""? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies \""I guess some one else got your wings\"". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place."
1,"I've been to just about all of the Whole Foods locations in the Valley and this one is by far the nicest. They have every natural/organic/gluten free/special diet item you can think of and the selection of organic produce is outstanding! I feel so blessed to have moved to a home within 10 minutes drive to this place :-)  They also have a great selection of ready-made meals and foods. I can't wait to try out the wine bar and $1 tacos!\n\nThe other shoppers can be kinda fancy...I like to go after my workout on Sundays so I feel so underdressed! Haha! It is North Scottsdale, though.... ;-)"
0,The only reason this place does not get one star is because the food did not make us sick. The Bellagio buffet was rather disappointing for our entire group. We went for dinner and it was $30. We waited 45 minutes in line on a Monday night to get in which we figured would result in great food. Wrong! First our server took forever to get our order. She seemed to have no way of knowing when we arrived because she first went to 2 tables that got there after us before getting to ours. However that's not why I'm rating the review bad. The crabs legs didn't seem so fresh and the buffet had a rather mediocre selection compared to the other buffets we visited. The desert selection was rather plain and neither of the two ice cream machines worked. I tried the house Merlot and it was horrible. The Kobe beef had an awkward taste to it and none of us took a second bite. To make things worse for the entire hour we were there our server never picked up our previous place or refilled our water. Talk about bad service. \n\nWe all agree not to visit this buffet on our next visit. We expected much more from the Bellagio.
1,Today I had tne best hair cut of my life.  The place is cute the people and clients were very nice. My hair cut is excelent and the message was a very pleasent suprise
1,"I really like supporting local businesses but hate breaking the bank -- this is definitely a great way to satisfy me!\n\nThe store itself is laid out well and has household supplies, food, personal hygiene, kids' toys, party supplies, jewelry... Every time I go in I find something new.\n\nOn my first visit I got a bad taste in my mouth because there was a very indifferent cashier.  Didn't say hi, didn't ask anything, I don't even think she told me my total.  I paid and while in the process of doing so, the phone rang and it happened to be her friend.  At that point I resigned any chance of conversation, collected my things, and left.\n\nThe second visit (it's on my way home and I'm a nice person that tries to give most places another chance) was a complete 180.  The lady welcomed me when I came in the door.  When I was checking out she was very bubbly and asked if everything was ok.  I presented my Yelp check-in special and she got all giddy and was like, \""Yay, that was my idea! I'm so glad they started using it!\""\n\nIt's definitely not the best dollar store in the world, but if you need some cheap party snacks in a pinch I'd recommend it.  Got a whole smorgasboard for 12 bucks!"
0,"Beautiful reuse of an old classic building, the wood ceiling, brick walls, old tile and mirror all add up to a nice space.  But the noise, oh the noise!  I felt like I was a victim of auditory assault!\n\nContemporary Southern Food made for an interesting menu but the \""hearty\"" fish and shrimp jambalaya was more of a nice fish dish not at all a jambalaya (and shrimp were so shrimpy they were nonexistent.) Please don't call a dish something that's it's not.  Best looking dishes of the night were companions' pork chop and the tomato tart.\n\nService needs some fine tuning.  Small plates as appetizers came out at the same time as main course and drinks and dishes were randomly put down in front of diners. Finally, if you can't make separate checks but will take different credit cards for different amounts, then at least put the right amount on each card please.\n\nWith the same parents as Beckett's Table, I know this baby is going to work out the growing pains and will be an asset to the 'hood soon!"
0,"I don't know what all the hype is about but I'm guessing it was for dinner because Sunday brunch sucked!! Definitely not worth the $35 dollars.  \n\nYay:\n-Desserts: Cheesecake, gelato, rice pudding, carrot cake, and the strawberries (from the chocolate covered strawberries) were all the things I liked from this buffet.\n-You have the option of paying $10 extra for champagne brunch which was nice.  \n\nNay:\n-Food: why is everything so salty?!? I'm surprised no one is tasting the food before it comes out.  After I was done eating, my tongue felt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.\n-Variety: They don't have that many.  There was an abundance of pork though. Bacon, sausage (breakfast sausage and sausage patties, and andouille), roasted pork (Chinese 5 spice-skin was not crispy, Chinese pork ribs, and at the carving station-pork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs).  They had a small section of Asian food-everything was bleh or too salty, Spanish/Italian foods, a large breakfast station, a breakfast omelette station, a make your own cereal station, salad bar, dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what, yes that's salty as well. \n-Carving station: I guess it's my fault for not asking about what was being served before I waited in line but there was NO prime rib!  I'm just so used to ALL the buffets in Vegas offering it, but this was a huge disappointment.  The only thing they had were roasted chicken, top sirloin, bone marrow and roast pig.  I liked that they had bone marrow BUT the toast that was served with it and the chimichurri was SALTY! UGH! It had like a strong garlic salt taste to it\n-The guy at the carving station: was very inattentive.  Didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  A customer asked for a slice of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.  Didn't even try to correct him and say that it wasn't prime rib.  Maybe he didn't hear him, but like I said, very inattentive.  I had to wave him down once because he was staring off somewhere else.\n\nI definitely regret coming here for brunch."
1,"We love this place, we go there a lot since we live just minutes away,  the servers are very friendly and we love the food and desserts there, there's nothing we haven't liked from there yet.  \nI didn't give them the full 5 stars because sometimes there's not enough servers working at busy times and we have noticed only one server for all tables."
0,"I don't understand the 4-stars folks.  Yes, the outside is pretty, yes, FLW did a great job on the design.  But you can come for lunch and see all that.  There's no reason to actually stay here.  The rooms are completely falling apart.  I had to move from my first one because the a/c sounded like a jack hammer AND the toilet didn't work.   The second one's carpet was soaking wet and the toilet worked...sometimes.  But after waiting an HOUR for the bellman to bring my key for the first move (when they originally said 10-15 minutes) I just sucked it up and stayed in the second broken room so I wouldn't be late for my meeting.\n\nSome of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options (the Ranch Stack at breakfast, the duck-fat poached fries at lunch).  But the service varied widely.  At Frank & Albert's, I had a bartender make me a to-go order who was so friendly and helpful.  The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.  Plus, the room service took forever. \n\nI also had a few spa treatments.  The massage was so good that I sought out a comment card to let her manager know.  I believe her name was Katie.  The facial was very mediocre and only lasted 38 minutes  (rather than 50 as advertised).  I wouldn't say my skin was in great condition afterward.  And the facialist was also trying to sell me some cleansing brush and products.  Not my favorite relaxing experience.  \n\nOverall, 2 stars for being pretty, the good massage, and because customer service wasn't consistently terrible.  But  I don't think I'll return next time I'm in Phoenix."
1,"Beer was great, atmosphere was great, food was great."
0,"This place, y'all....\n\nI wanted it to be so much more. I'm even struggling to write about an experience because there really wasn't one.\n\nOkay, my first experience there was just for drinks. I ordered two drinks and each one of them was incorrect when I ordered them. One of them was a beer, not that difficult to me at least. Then I was charged for it which really irritated me. I will say they took off the incorrect drink no hassle, but still it's a nuisance. \n\nMy second experience was for lunch. I ordered the chicken chop salad. The salad was great. Everything was fresh and tasty, but man does the service suck. We were forced to sit at the bar because there were no tables available, however, they had plenty of seats. I know they use Open Table so maybe they had reservations, but not from what I saw.\n\nI just don't get this place. I'm not sure why it's named, \""Dahntahn\"", but really doesn't reflect Pittsburgh inside. Don't get me wrong I hate how people will highlight the flaws in Pittsburgh by way of using some of the local language. I'm glad it has more of a 60's retro feel to it, but I just don't get it overall. What are they trying to do with the space? And there are way too many televisions in the bar. The space is too small for all of those television sets. I feel like I'm at a Best Buy when I sit there.\n\nThis restaurant does not reflect downtown or \""Dahntahn\"" to me one bit."
0,"They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!"
0,"I stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered the mahi mahi plate.  When I opened the container, I looked at the fish and it definitely didn't look like mahi.  It looked like the fillet of a small fish where they butterfly it before frying.  When I tasted it, I definitely knew it wasn't  mahi.  I do some boat fishing in Hawaii and eat mahi quite often so I know the taste.  This definitely was something else.\n\nRather than making a scene, I ate the \""fish\"" plate and left.  I hope Eddie Flores reads this and puts quality control procedures in place and insists that his franchisees adhere to the good quality control that made L & L popular in the first place.\n\nI won't ever eat at that location again!"
0,Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.
0,"The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle."
1,"I went in today to use the self dog wash facilities with my 14 year old Cairn Terrier.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful.  The environment is overall very clean.  The place is a bit older and the tubs and equipment show wear.  The water is plenty warm and the pressure can go up to super high. The available shampoo and conditioner are hypoallergenic.  I decided to use my own shampoo since I prefer the smell.  Brushes are also provided, but again, I used my own.  The dryer has a super high blower motor, which removes the water, but doesn't use heat..  I had the staff trim the nails on my dog, they did a quick, gentle job. The dogs do roam freely in the sectioned off day care room.  There is a frequent customer punch card, if you buy five washes, the sixth is free."
1,"Went in on a Sunday night around 6pm and even though there was a crowded wait, we were seated in less than ten minutes. What you do with AYCE is scan the two menus (one with everything on it from desserts to appetizers to hand rolls and the other with pictured specialty rolls) and order a few choices. They are delivered almost instantly! Devour those and REPEAT! I love this system even though at times it can be confusing. This place is great even though its crowded, get to know your neighbors! it can be as fun as you make it. I love the waitresses that urge you to try everything. It was my dad's first time AYCE and I'd have to say he was liking it. \n\nTips: \n-Bring a pen to mark what you have tried! \n-Drink green tea (which is included in AYCE) when you feel like you've eaten too much yet still want to go on! :D our little secret. which isn't really a secret as it is a known fact...\n-Ask for half-rolls when you just want to try a roll for the first time! Really saves your stomach. \n-Don't skimp on the mochi and ice cream dessert at the end!...or inbetween rolls ;D"
0,Love the food. Not a big fan of the environment. The Chef/Owner/Namesake Antonio Park is charismatic but he lacks a staff around him to really make the restaurant work. Excited to see what it can become but not terribly impressed with the dining experience thus far.
1,"First trip to Vegas and this was a perfect place to stay. The vibe is very relaxed, no casino and no smoking is a HUGE plus! The staff is friendly and attentive and very accommodating. Sign up for MLife before you arrive...we got a big discount on a Cirque show because of it. Three small downsides...not deal breakers though. The free wi-fi is terrible, unless you are very comfortable with your travel companion you may be a bit put off by the placement of the toilet and the pool is small and often crowded. On the plus side, it is an awesome location connected to the Bellagio and Aria, no smoking or casino and the rooms are clean and very comfortable. We had a city corner view. Highly recommended."
1,"Dear Hotel Chocolat\n\nI want you to know I dreamed about you last night, I think I might be in love.\n\nyours,\n\nJd\n\n...........But really what an awesome shop. Was lucky enough to be there last night for a tasting that was free but I still ended up spending \u00a330 on things to take home with me.\n\nStaff are great, welcoming, banterous and inlove with what they are selling. Was treated to a great avriety of their treats my favourite being a chilli caramel!! Nom!!!!\n\nTheir Cocoa-coffee shop at the back is inspired - loved my wee machiato.\n\nVery much looking fwd to cooking with the cocoa meat rub. This place is a palace of chocolate and a must visit for anyone!!! :o)"
0,"This is one of the worst places. Really I can't believe that they expect people to pay for this stuf they serve as food. We ordered fajitas & were served scraps of meat. Also, for a Mexican food restaurant to serve guacamole from a package is a bad sign."
0,"This location has 11 or 12 regular screens and one IMAX auditorium. This review is simply based my experience today at the IMAX theatre.\n\nWhat kind of sorry ass excuse for an IMAX theatre is this place?! I was expecting what you would normally get from an IMAX experience: a screen so big your peripheral vision is...more screen. A total immersive experience. Well...not so much at this place.\n\nThe screen is barely bigger than standard and arguably smaller than Harkins' various Cine Capri screens. It's the normal type of stadium seating you'd see at a Harkins or newer AMC theatre but certainly not an intimate IMAX auditorium where you feel you are part of the movie. It was such a disappointment.\n\nThe sound was hit and miss. The bass is solid and rumbles the theatre which adds to the experience, but it was tough to hear any words being spoken during moments where there was a lot of loud action. I actually don't even know what was said at certain parts of the film. \n\nAll in all I would never go back to this place and spend money at their IMAX screen. I went 25 miles out of my way to experience The Dark Knight in an IMAX setting and it was a waste of precious gas and time. I'm sure the regular screens are comparable to Harkins and AMC theatres and seeing films there is normally a usual trip to the movies. But there is absolutely no reason to spend money on an \""IMAX experience\"" at this place.\n\nAs my girlfriend half-jokingly put it: \""Someone should call the Better Business Bureau on them for claiming that an IMAX theatre.\""\n\nOne plus: They do have Nathan's brand hot dogs."
0,"On business travel and TP recommended by hotel staff. Went on a Thurs night for dinner alone at bar and place packed with bikers, yuppie bikers, UFC misfits, and 25-30 yr hat backward wearing tight \""Affection\"" shirt guys. Ok, I will give it try. Sat at bar and took 15 mins to order a beer and menu. Waited over 20 mins for server to follow up with me or even take my order. Had enough of bad service bars with 22 yr gals dressed in slutty outfits to know that nothing (food) good is going to happend out of this experiment. Paid for beer and gone. This place seems to be more focused on their sexy waitresses' than service. BTW, not very bright gals working here. Nice clean place, but a mix of Road House, Porky's, and Scottsdale."
1,"After deciding I liked a particular stool in the copenhagen store, I was trying to make my way back to make a final decision. I ended up finding out about this place while searching yelp for the copenhagen store operation hours and noticed a clearance center. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI wouldn't exactly say that you can get a matching set of just about anything, they have an eclectic selection of mix and match clearance items. I was specifically looking for bar stools at the time, and was able to find some that originally cost upwards of $300+ retail cost, and ended up grabbing them up for just over $100 a piece. The stools I found here were better than the one I was going back to the store to check out!\n\nIt was great, I was able to stay in my $300 budget and come home with great looking and quality chairs as opposed to \""meehhh, whatever\"" I could get from the local swap meet or craigslist.\n\nIm so happy I found you Copenhagen Imports Clearance Center, I will definitely be back if I ever need more furniture!"
0,"ONE WORD: TERRIBLE.\n\nAside from the hostess being very pleasant, I can't say a positive thing about this place.  The server was determined to act as disinterested as possible and the food was equally unimpressive.  \n\nMy wife ordered matzoh ball soup which was basically Campbell's basic chicken noodle with a dough ball plopped in the middle.  Okay, so maybe it's best to stick to the traditional American fare at a place called \""Red, White, and Blue\"".  Unfortunately that didn't work either as the burger and onion rings I had tasted just as plain as what you'd get from the frozen food aisle of your local grocery store.  Pretty disappointing considering the soup cost $10 and the burger was $16.  \n\nAside from bringing the food, the server refilled drinks once and then brought us the check.  Didn't ask if we wanted additional drinks, to order dessert, or anything else.  He seemed fairly annoyed at the presence of anyone in his section.  Perhaps it distracted his football-watching on a Sunday afternoon.  The mumbling and avoidance of all eye contact and acknowledgment was a pretty nice bonus too.  I guess there's a first time for everything and this was my first time eating at a full-service restaurant without leaving a tip. \n\nOverall, by far the worst place I've eaten in Vegas both food and service-wise."
1,"You can always find something interesting at Bookman's.  My family and I like to trade in old books for store credit and pick up new books.  They also have electronics, games, toys, puzzles, music instruments, etc.  \n\nIt is a great way to de-clutter your home!"
1,"Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful."
1,"Wow! This was impressive. Absolutely loved the decor, although I think we went there too early. Around 7pm and the place was barely getting going, then again, it is Vegas. We would have gone later but had a show to catch. The food however was fantastic. We had kobe flat iron steaks. They melt in your mouth. Also, the truffle oil macaroni and cheese was to die for. The tableside  ceasar was spicy! Not sure why, but it was still cool to have someone come to your table and make everything by scratch in front of you. Definitely recommend the goat cheese and truffle oil bak lava. Very rich experience."
1,"Awesome!!!!!  Our server, Dan, was great... he went through the menu with us and had great suggestions depending on our likes.... he did not do us wrong!!!!  We started with the ox tail fries.... delicious!  I was surprised at how sweet the meat was, but the spicy from the peppers and onions was a great counter to the sweetness... I had the miyagi-san burger, and it was maybe one of the best burgers i have ever had!!!!  My boyfriend ordered the spicy miso burger, that too was pretty great!\n\nI will def. be coming back!"
1,"So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!"
1,"Alas! Someone in The Meadows who knows how to cut Asian hair! My mother owned a beauty shop in LA so I rarely got my hair cut elsewhere. But since she retired, I've been playing Russian roulette with various beauty shops in town. I saw this place about a month ago and decided to give it a try today. \n\nThe owner took me right away without an appointment. I even changed my mind halfway from a regular cut to a shorter cut. She accommodated me without any hesitation. Not only that, it's the best hair cut I've had since my mom sold her shop. I didn't have to say anything. She just knew how to make me look good (not an easy task).\n\nShe then shampooed and rinsed (standard at most Korean hair salons), all for $20. Try getting that at Supercuts! My mom was with me and even she commented how well the lady cut my hair. This place is MOTHER APPROVED. \n\nEven though this location is new, the lady said she used to be by the Convention Center. She's been in business for years. I can tell when someone isn't confident while cutting hair. This lady knows her stuff. I am so happy with my haircut!!!"
0,"Unfortunately the service here has dropped off in the past few years. Every family trip (about once annually now) we would come down to Chinatown to grab some good eats. In the past this restaurant was bustling full of people, service was quick, and portion/food was great.\n\nSeems the prices haven't changed too much but the food quality, portions, and slow service (with noone else in the restaurant) have dropped off. Some of the plates were okay, but most were bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of."
0,"Fell way short of all the hype. From what I'm reading, LA is better, but I can't imagine them being that much better. For starters, I did not care for the hard casings on the dogs. Flavor was not that great either. I really think this place gets by on their image more than their food."
0,"I am very displeased with Bunker Cemetery and Mortuary. My father passed away 4 years ago. I have visited him twice a year since that time. Two weeks ago I took my sister, and her family, to visit his grave for the first time. When we got there we immediately noticed that the grave marker was missing. I walked over to the office and was told that an order would be put in to find the marker .The excuse given was that grass grows very quickly in Las Vegas and it was possibly buried. My information was given and someone would call me. I did not receive a call. I called on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. I never spoke to a person. Finally, I called my sister to ask for her help. I was too involved and needed the relief of help. She took over with gusto and was a promised a call back in regards to this issue. She did not receive a call back. That following Tuesday she called me to inform me that she had spoken to Manager John Laskey . Apparently because the grave markers are considered a \""90 day marker\"" (which was never explained to us) and we left it there for longer than the recommended time, we are responsible for it. I honestly don't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is the fact that we had to call 5 times to get someone to talk to us. Also, why were we not given a courtesy call when the marker was either stolen or broken? I find this customer service to be appalling. This is not a sweater shop. You are dealing with the loved ones of people who have passed. Show some compassion."
1,"My first visit to this relatively new Thai offering.  I am so pleased to have this reasonably priced, solid menu, casual Thai restaurant in the South Hills!\nThe service is polite and friendly, as well as helpful if you are not a Thai regular.\nI had the Duck Curry.  My Son had Thai Noodle Curry. \nThe heat levels go from 1-5 and they will caution you accordingly.\nI rate my Curry at a solid 4.  My son is about the same...he asked for more heat after sampling, the wait staff was quick to remedy!\nThey have a full battery, however I had the Jasmine tea, which was a great compliment to the meal.\nI look forward to trying their weekday lunch specials which include many different curries at under $8, including salad!\n\nIf you want a casual, authentic Thai experience that won't strip your budget, I highly recommend \""My Thai\""."
0,"More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value."
0,"Beware  the Resort charge that no one mentions until you see it on your bill at check out! Just what is this for? Especially considering that to use the weight room there is another $25 charge and the cardio room is small with a few although nice machines. Booked through price-line and thought I was getting a good deal but with the $20 a day extra charge,I would have booked another hotel for the same $.\nMirage is a decent Hotel that has certainly seen it's glory days. The rooms are showing some wear and the hotel in general is OK but certainly not a 3 or 4 star property any longer. The front desk was efficient and 1 out of 2 desk persons was friendly as well.\nFood and beverage was decent at Carnegie deli and good at Stacks. Stacks maybe a hidden gem for Vegas food and cocktails\n\nSurf"

0,"I do love the food here, although it is extremely Americanized Sushi. That's to be expected, but this isn't why I gave it two stars. I went for dinner and I thought I had entered a club. The music was loud and thumping, and we literally had to yell to have a conversation. It was during happy hour so I'm not sure if that is why, but all the same it didn't help the experience. I don't mind loud music, but it definitely didn't feel appropriate in this restaurant. I guess I'd go back, but maybe I'll just take someone I don't really want to talk to. ;-)"

1,My boyfriend and I are both from Louisiana so we were excited to try Baby Kay's. We both had the Bloody Mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. He got the shrimp po-boy and I got the veggie \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Both were quite good. On our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. Next time we'll stick with the poboy! No vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad.
1,"Love the breakfast buffet here. My favorites were the eggs benedict, eggs florentine, crepes, salads, desserts and coffee. All top quality from the service received to our freshly brewed, flavorful coffees. Eggs benny were perfect which is impressive to maintain for a buffet sitting under the heat lamps. If you go 1/2 hr. before the lunch turnaround, you'll get to experience lunch items too. Will be back on our next trip!"
1,"Excellent very fresh sushi! Great crowd and worth the little wait. I am visiting from Los Angeles and this restaurant is as good as many in LA, NYC & SFO"
1,"Could not have imagined a better experience. Had prearranged a package that included unlimited sangria with one of the managers prior to our visit.  We let them choose the food.  So glad we did.  Food was amazing.  I couldn't believe the quantity and the quality of the food that kept coming out of the kitchen, including dessert. AND, our glasses were never empty.\nService was exceptional, from the manager to the bussers.  \nI can't wait to go back"

1,"I have a sneaking suspicion that the Old Childrens Bookshelf is aimed more at nostalgic adults than children. \n\nTucked away on Canongate, it's a lovely shop that sells well preserved copies of childrens fiction, picture books, short stories and annuals from the 1950s onwards. All of the books are beautifully displayed and I have to admit, seeing original copies of The Moomins, Peter Pan and Where The Wild Things Are made me feel quite misty-eyed for my own childhood. \n\nIf your little Jack or Janet already has enough children's books, OCB also sells a small selection of adorable prints and comic books. Personally however, I'd opt for one of the illustrated editions of Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz. They look and read beautifully and are sprinkled with magic!"
1,You've gotta try the cotton candy ice with custard. It's simply incredible.
1,"I enjoy Cathouse for its easygoing, laid back qualities.  Don't get me wrong, you can definitely get wild and free (and we have!), but to me it just seems to have a different feel - in a good way!\n\nEach time we've been, we've had a table.  The servers and wait staff are always so nice.  The bouncers and door staff are always pretty cool and reasonable as well.  Ladies will usually be able to get in for free, at least that's what I've experienced and been told by others.\n\nIf you're looking for the hottest, most happening club scene that's busy and bustling, just know that Cathouse sometimes doesn't get \""club-crazy packed\""...which is something I enjoy about it.  I mean, don't imagine crickets echoing off an empty dance floor by any means, but don't be surprised or deterred if you don't see a crazy long line to get in.\n\nThe music has a hip hop/top 40 feel to it, which is always fun.  The vibe from the people is carefree and fun.  I've had A TON of fun here on a couple separate occasions!"
1,"I was beyond impressed with this place! I had the unfortunate experience of getting side swiped leaving my poor car with a scrape down its side. Gerber is teamed with Geico, the insurer for the guy who hit me, and I was told to come in, drop off my car, and they would have a rental waiting for me. Everything went exactly as they said. I dropped my car off and was on the road again within 10 minutes. The repairs went relatively quickly for what they had to do and when I picked it up I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The main thing that I loved about them was their follow through. If they said they were going to call on Tuesday afternoon they called on Tuesday afternoon. I would use and recommend them to anyone!"
1,I had a nice little breakfast crossiant/sandwich here and it was delicious. Place was clean and busy. Go small business!
1,"this has been my place to go EVERY single time i am in vegas. the bartender (not sure if he is there anymore) is why i go there seriously, he is the best bartender i have come across in all my trips to vegas. when im craving that blue cheese burger and a good beer i go here. shout out to D! hope to see you soon!"
0,"Wow. \n\nFor a company that constantly talks about its commitment to customer service, I have to say, this is one of the most abysmal experiences I have ever had. \n\nAfter placing an order for in-store pick up, I promptly received an email indicating that I would receive an email within 72 hours, advising me of pick up availability. After five days, I tried to contact them: no dice. I emailed, tried to call (couldn't even get through), and used available social media channels to no avail. I tried calling again the next day, and was queued for 20 minutes before reaching a person -- who promptly put me on hold again to \""research my order.\"" \n\nAnd was basically told \""whoops.\"" \n\nNo order delivery, no idea when I'd be made whole, no effort to resolve - and oh, by the by? My account had already been drafted of payment for the items they couldn't tell me when I'd receive. \n\nIn my attempt to cancel the order, I was advised it would be seven to ten days to return my funds (yes, 7-10 days!). \n\nThat was 15 days ago, the funds STILL haven't been returned, and when I called to try to resolve that, I was again told, basically  \""oh, well. Can't help you.\"" \n\nA singularly awful experience all the way around - and now, I guess I'm just out the money, since they refuse to provide any tracking or verification of the funds' alleged return to my account. Lovely."
0,"I dont mind small- if they are very good with what they are stocking. Who the fuck is supplying and merchandising this store? I say this because I know people that work for the MJ brand and have been a buyer. I know some of the items picked arent the \""sellers\""....why put it in such a limited space spot? It definitely was a \""throwaway\"" store- where it seems the leftovers get sent. \n\nI came in with my brother who was visiting from LA... Wanted this one wallet- of course they didn't have. Nor my backup choices. Shoulda just asked my brother to buy and bring it from Cali. MJ back home on Melrose is spacious, good selection and the staff is both silly and serious in the best possible ways. I didn't even get helped here or greeted....sad because there was 3 people working that weekend. Why do you even need 3 people working at a tiny store? It was \""crowded\"" with only two other customers there.\n\n2.5 stars"

We  told Christopher Greene the assistant security supervisor who did nothing and laughed in our faces and gave his us his card for doing nothing about it.

1,I had looked up Postino on Yelp before heading there.

0,"Outdated remnant from the 70's hostile corporate junk bond takeover of the old mobster Vegas.  Circus' is about due for a good taste of its own medicine.  Please, someone buy and revamp/demolish this casino?!  It has been renovated but never actually updated since the 90's.  It's smelly dingy and awkwardly laid out.  \n\nThere are many activities for the kids.  Most are also outdated.  The rooms are cheap.  Expecting a Motel 6 rather than a resort type room.  I would have to say that this casino, Vegas terms, is embarrassing.  To think international visitors come to our town imagining the City Center but get weasel'd here because of the low price.  \n\nEmbarrassing.  lol"
1,"Big fan of unique steakhouses across the country and this one joins the club!  First of all the Wild Boar and Venison sausages as a starter with chutney were full of flavour and so delicious.  The Buffalo Rib-eye may be a bit pricey but come-on, when is the next time you can complete the Boar-Deer-Buffalo Trifecta in one sitting??  The Buff rib-eye is full of deep, rich flavors and worth every penny....Service was excellent and the whole experience was a delight  - will return!"
1,Took my son to Oregano's last night for his birthday. Loved the Guaca-Tony!!!!!!! they gave my son a free pizza cookie for his birthday!! Thanks
1,"I was a skeptic at first, thinking that this place was luring people in with it's glossy exterior only to fall short when it comes to actual quality. I was wrong. The Valley Ho is not only fun to utilize as a word-play, it's also a fantastic hotel. \n\nI will start with the things I didn't like...because there are only a couple and they are relatively minor. \n#1 The in-room coffee. It's by far, THE WORST coffee I've ever had. I've had better cups of instant coffee. The V-Ho is trying real hard on this and I give them an A for effort. But whoever was in charge of selecting the coffee system cares a lot more about appearance and, I'd venture to guess, is not even a recreational coffee drinker. This \""thing\"" makes a cup of coffee that looks like sewar water and tastes like dasani. \nPlease, V-Ho, I beg of you to re-think your in-room coffee system. \n\n#2 Smoking at the pool. Yes, the pool is a scene, but I'm really not into having cigarette and cigar smoke wafting in my face all day. \n\n#3 There is no #3. But I wasn't really crazy about the town of Scottsdale itself. Yes, in March the weather is perfect. But the town is a you-could-be-anywhere town. All the chain restaurants. It feels a little like Disneyland, with everything setup for the tourists. Unless you're here to by art, there's nothing that you will find interesting about this place. After 1 day of looking around, I was content just to hang out and eat at the hotel.\n\nThis hotel has great rooms, the beds are superior with delicate, soft linens, a mattress that is both soft & firm, an amazing tub in the middle of the room, ample balcony space, great tv with ipod hookup, and they even brought a DVD player into my room so I could watch movies. \n\nThey also don't nickel & dime you like other hotels: wireless is free and using the gym at the spa (which is pretty good) is free. I like these little touches.\n\nThe layout of the rooms is great, you wouldn't think a tub in the middle of the room would work but it does. There's a curtain for privacy if you want it. \n\nLastly, the hotel staff were great. Helpful and friendly but not in that \""I am here to be your servant\"" kind of way. Maybe it's just me, but they actually seemed genuine. And even if that's an act, I rather liked it."
1,"Wow - I was pleasantly surprised by Brio. When my friend suggested meeting up at SanTan Village, I wasn't too hopeful I'd find a decent place for us to eat. But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian. We didn't have any room for dessert, unfortunately. All in all, this was a really pretty, tasty, and friendly place for dinner. I'd like to return!"
1,Wanted to eat here it didn't happen.  Showed up to late.  I never seem to know what times it is especially in Vegas.   I sat at the bar and had a high priced glass of scotch.  This list of Whiskey and Scotch was amazing.  The glass was nice and the ice cube for it on the rocks was unique still haven't seen anything like it since.  One day ill be back for my expensive perfectly cooked steak.
0,"We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \""wow, thats tasty\"" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!"
1,"Getting a reservation here was a little hard, but it was worth eating dinner at 10:15. The ambiance is great and very comfortable. The decor is classy as well, don't order too much!"
0,"All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said \""we'll be right with you\"", \""Hello\"", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.\n\nI finally got an \""Are you ready?\"", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a \""Hello. How may I help you?\"" Just an \""Are you ready?\"" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.\n\nThe food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves."
0,"In July 2012 I rode in a Yellow-Checker-Star taxi and was told by the driver that this was \""the elite fleet\"" for locals in Las Vegas. Now that I am a local in Las Vegas, I find that this taxi company is not \""elite\"" at all. I would honestly suggest avoiding using YCS Transportation whether you are a local in Las Vegas or a visitor. The reason: You can wait forever a never get a cab after you call. The people who take the calls sound exasperated and helpless."
0,"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
1,Went to Georges for a alignment on my truck. Turns out my tire was about to blow which discount tire some how missed. I was advised not to take my truck on the freeway let alone drive very far at all because of how bad my tire is/was. \n\nThanks to Georges Alignment and Brakes I was able to avoid what could of been  a horrible accident. If I have questions regarding my tires now I will go to Georges Alignment and Brakes before I go to the Discount Tire shop on Blue Diamond rd since the assistant manager there some how missed how bad my tire was and just wanted to sell me new tires or rims and tires instead of letting me know I only have 1 bad tire that is ready to blow and could get me killed on the freeway if I continue to drive on it. \n\nGeorges also had my truck for a hour and I know it took up space for them and they did have to look at it but they did not charge me anything either. They were much more concerned that I got it taken care of asap and even directed me to a tire shop close by as well as some advice on how to possibly save some money on the replacement.
0,"Wow.\n\nSo-so Chinese food for twice the price.\n\nNo wonder, it's a chain restaurant. Hey, they sell their food in the frozen food department at the grocery store, too. It might be the same quality. That may or may not be sad depending on the consumer. Is it that good from the freezer? Do they just microwave one of those bad boys in the restaurant?\n\nThe prices might be worth it for dinner but lunch? Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"

1,"As close as this location is to where I stay, I had never been to it before.  They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.\n\n All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.\n\nWill I go back? Hell yeah.  But I'll take my own pepper."
0,"As per usual with gyms like Gold's, beware of the hidden fees. Gym is okay....equipment and surroundings are dated and past their prime. Make sure you read the fine print. I just went to quit my contract and found out I had been charged a fee of $39 for annual renewal, whatever that entails. You need to give 31 days notice of quitting so they can gouge another months fee out of you. The lady Amanda told me that I was unlikely to get a refund on the annual fee I saw and that I was to be charged another month also. They don't really care if you are unhappy at Gold's. They just want to get as much cash out of you as possible. I will continue to work out at my apartment complex at Camden. Much nicer and free bottled water."
0,"LOL. These other reviews make me laugh. \n\nSo I've gotten weird solicitations from crackheads here at night so my BF was with me until I was on the bus. So the other people here arent alone in this. That was my first time and the only way I can get out of Vegas for cheap on a holiday weekend to see my mom last minute. Kinda scary but not the worse. A  scarier stop I can think of is Downtown LA greyhound which is located in slum city....like streets and alleys adjacent have tents and carts parked up and drumcan fires. Had to pick up a friend there....and it was daytime and equally scary as this place as night. Nighttime there...fuck that- my friend can take a cab to main, safer Downtown where I'll be waiting.\n\n It's almost like every greyhound is in a seedy area though. Seedy areas for a shady company. \n\nNow I have patience and am fairly objective and give chances to companies but never again greyhound. \n\nLast incident, my second time taking GH:\n\nTried to buy tickets online and it wouldnt go through...it says \""try again\"" etc....next day I tried again and it went to a blank page. Looked at my debit card right before the day I needed to go to Cali and saw I was charged twice. Figured I'll go straighten it out in the station and just get my one ticket and refund the other. There was no tickets there for me. But I was charged for two roundtrips?! She said to call corporate. It was early morning and those pencil pushers werent open/answering yet. So fine, I'll buy another ticket. It wouldnt go through because of the two ticket purchases my card wouldnt let it. It was 30 minutes until the bus was leaving. Tried to see if I can call my bank to maybe tell them to authorize it- it's still closed. Tried an ATM, my card is completely frozen. My mom in law didnt have cash. I had to go home, get cash from grandma and take a later bus. It was screwing up a bit of my plans, but I can make it for most of the days itinerary still....until the bus is delayed an hour plus boarding time....hour and a half. Later I realize this too wasn't as fast as the morning bus, this one had a meal break as this was a connector bus for people going farther than Los Angeles. Damn....so 2 extra hours plus the 4 1/2 to get there. Forget all the plans. I was gonna make it for dinner if I rushed from the station. \n\nOn my return trip, my mom was late in getting me as her shift relief got stuck in traffic and she cant leave her patient alone. Got at the station in time to buy a ticket and such. The bus left without me! I was at the station buying a ticket The ticket sales dude forgot maybe o say hold on!! My mom chased the bus and I was waving and trying to show the man my ticket. He looked but no action. We were at coming to a stoplight...if he wanted to he could have let me in during that light. \n\nI had to take a 6am express flight back to Vegas so I can make it to work. \n\nThey canceled the two charges on my debit card but would not refund my ticket from the bus leaving since I was \""at fault for not showing up earlier\"". I was there buying my ticket- they left me, 5 minutes earlier than scheduled too so I thought I should've been safe. \n\nThis was some sort of cosmic karma joke I thought, but after telling friends and family- many offered stories of GH mishaps. \n\nNever again. No \""last minute\"" trips using Greyhound.. Booking 3 weeks ahead for the Southwest Airlines \""Wanna Get Away?\"" specials or driving or I'm not coming at all if so and so decide they are having a birthday party this weekend afterall. I'm staying home!"
0,"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, so I usually order a quesadilla of some sort. I came here for lunch today and ordered a cheese quesadilla. The server asked if I wanted it crispy or soft. I was a little confused and told him I wanted a folded quesadilla, not a cheese crisp. He then told me that unless I order the quesadilla with meat, that all they do is put cheese on the tortilla and put it in the microwave. I was even more confused. Why would I come to a restaurant to order food that has been prepared in the microwave? And why would a restaurant admit to microwaving their food? Anyways, my friend and I decided to split an order of mediocre nachos. Needless to say, I will not be back."
1,"It's been awhile since I've paid less than $12 for a movie ticket during prime time, and let me just say it's o so nice. The theater has ample FREE parking (none of this having to validate garbage) and the theater isn't overrun by youngins. The people who frequent here aren't the type to add their own commentaries during the movies which is a breath of fresh air. Its a nice atmosphere and great place to take the kids to a movie. \n   The theater rooms themselves are clean and large. This will now be my go to theater while in Pitts."
0,We have gone to the buffer for years back when they had crab nightly and for us it was the best buffet ever. We always ate here one while visiting from SoCal The crab buffet  ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on Friday night so we went\nWe waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm. They had several VIP lines and sat everyone in those lines before general public - very unfair. The crab legs were tiny baby crab no meat like before and poor tasting\nThis buffet went from the top of our choice to where we will never go back \nThey are out of town in Henderson and used to worth the drive but  not anymore most other casinos have a better buffet and better service

0,"I hired EcoFresh to clean 2 rugs and my formal living room couch and loveseat after our move.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have a good experience with them and the end result is 3 cushions on the couch and loveseat are ruined. \nI called Ecofresh the day after they came to do the cleaning of my belongings to inform them that I had noticed some spots on my couch/loveseat after they cleaned and it looked like the fabric had been bleached. They sent one of their technicians out a few days later to redo the bleached areas and I ended up with blue stained cushions. I called them again to inform them of the blue stains that were now on my cushions and again they sent their same technician out again to redo the same cushions for the 3rd time. I ended up with 'bleached stained' looking cushions again. \n\nI continued my communication after 4 weeks in regards to the damaged cushions (4th call) with Ecofresh and they asked if they could come pick up the cushions and examine them at their shop.\nAfter a week without my cushions, I had to call and follow-up with Ecofresh to see what the outcome was after they took my cushions to their shop to examine and asked if I could pick them up from them, but then I was informed that they were at a different business unrelated to Ecofresh in downtown Phoenix, at 'McFarland Carpet Service'. They sent my cushions to a different business owner and he had nothing to do with my cushions.\n\n At this point I spoke with Phillip (the owner of Ecofresh) and he seemed unremorseful about this whole situation and mishap.   I informed Phillip of having a few upholstery professionals examine the spots on my couch and he indicated to me that they needed an 'ICR certification' and if they didn't have this certification that their opinion didn't matter or qualify.\n\nAfter picking up my cushions and finding out that McFarland Carpet service was NOT ICR certified and was not sure why Ecofresh brought my cushions to him, Phillip proceed to call me back and say that he was sorry and he would be refunding me my money for the cleaning service. Phillip then indicated to me that he was going to get an 'ICR certified' person for upholstery to come examine my cushions so we could find out why this happened.  I was please of this news.\n\nPhillip had Oscar from Bailey's furniture come out examine my couch. When I called Oscar to coordinate a time for him to come he indicated that he did business with Ecofresh and he was NOT \""ICR\"" certified. Oscar came out and examined my couches and indicated to me that they used the wrong product on my couches and he would let Ecofresh know the damage they had done, since they supposedly hired him to look at my furniture.\n\nAt this point it has been about 5 weeks since I began the whole process with Ecofrech. They said they were going to refund me (last week) the charges for the services and in the case the damage was their fault they would pay for it. I have not seen a check for the refund for the services and no resolution on my damaged couches.\n\n From the 2 individuals as well as Oscar from \""Baileys Furniture\"" (that Ecofresh hired) there is about $ 4,000 worth of damage.\n\nI would NOT recommend EcoFresh and I wish them the best of luck in their business if this is how they treat their customers."

1,"A church-themed restaurant with benches instead of chairs, lots of dark wood and a dark, rustic feel? That's not at all what this restaurant is about, but hey, could be a hot idea.\n\nThe restaurant's name, Communion, actually refers to the idea of sharing. We were seated in the small side room with grey stone walls, which provided a perfect setting and atmosphere to support the act. Oh, and the food is not all you'll be sharing - the restaurant has a unisex bathroom. I can already imagine awesome \""how we met\"" stories coming out of this.\n\nCommunion's food is broad in range and would best be described as \""contemporary European\"" market cuisine. The menu consists of tapas-sized dishes and larger plates to share. My friend and I decided to start with some oysters, the salmon tartare bouch\u00e9e with a basil emulsion and cucumber brunoise, and rollmops (pickled herring wrapped around slices of onion and pickled gherkin) with chive pur\u00e9e and sour cream. Tartare is an easy miss, but both of these amuse-bouches were completely flavourful and delicious.\n\nNext, we tried this whole \""sharing thing\"" by ordering the \""Stuffed Savoie cabbage\"" - a half cabbage shell filled with layers of olive tapenade, mashed butternut squash, feta cheese, and quinoa salad with pistachios and garlic flowers.  Sounds weird? It was... But in an unexpected \""i-ve'never-tasted-this-before-but-I-really-DO-like-it!\"" sort of way. Tasty (and health conscious!) comfort-style food.\n\nWe finished the entire  1/2 cabbage which, unfortunately, deterred us from ordering dessert. Apparently it's made by a Parisian chef... Certainly a reason for another visit.\n\nCommunion's concept is cute, but possibly only if a pairs agrees on a dish.  Would adding some single dishes dilute the restaurant's concept? Maybe. In any case, I'll end with this: Communion is perfect for a chill and comfortable dinner with friends or for a romantic date. It's cozy, and sometimes, party girls need a night that's good for the soul.\n\n\nFood 8.5/10, Atmosphere (ifyouwantachillsetting)9/10, Pretty people 8/10, Music (whenyoucanhearit) 8/10, Service 9.5/10.\n\n\nPictures: http://belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/communion/"
1,"Amy is truly amazing!!! I hired her to help coordinate my wedding and it was the best decision I made in regards to my wedding. She was available to meet multiple times before the wedding in order to go over what I wanted and what she would need to do the day of the wedding. Amy even visited the wedding site months before so she would have a better idea of where things were. Then Amy completely coordinated the rehearsal. She was a million times better and more organized than the wedding coordinator the venue provided.\n\nThe day of my wedding was a dream and ran completely smooth (even though it rained!). Amy was organized down to the tiniest detail. She even made sure I drank water and had food in my stomach. She is an expert at coordinating others. Amy had no problem directing the other vendors and my decorating helpers.\n\nAmy, I cannot say thank you enough! You took all of the stress off of me and I was able to enjoy my big day!

I had to go check this pizzeria because I had read an article in the Republic were the owners of this pizzeria claimed to be the creators of the best pizza Napoletana in Phoenix.\nI began to doubt their claims the minute I was served a Caprese Salad with anemic tomatoes and stale bread.\nI ordered the Pizza Napolitana, tomato, mozzarella and anchovies. The chewy dough had good flavor but if it had lacked the anchovies, this pie would have been dead in flavor.\nLots to improve in the service, I witnessed a table of 8 leave because they had been ignored for 45 minutes.\nThe semifreddo was spectacular but to be frank, this pizzeria lacks what Cibo has in abundance; good service, authentic chewy slightly burnt and blistered dough, a tomato sauce that can't be replicated in flavor, a mozzarella that plays a symphony of flavors, in one word...the real Pizza napolitana. No questions, no arguments."
0,"WORST PLACE IN PITTSBURGH\n\nHad a Groupon so decided to go there. We called ahead of time to confirm what time they close. The lady on the phone said they close at 10:30pm. When my wife and I entered at 10:00pm, NO ONE came to seat us! They were doing their own stuff as if we didn't exist. Strike ONE.\n\nSome waiter probably felt bad for us and painfully slowly seated us at a half cleaned table. Another 'head waitress' walked by and whispered to him \""kitchen is closed\"" and walked off. He tried telling us that the kitchen was closed already. So we told him that we had called etc. He asked us to sit anyways. Strike TWO.\n\nFood was OK. Not as good as I thought. The Brie tarts and puff pastry chicken appetizers were fine but the salmon entree was substandard. Walked to the bathroom to wash my hands...and it saw the DIRTIEST dishwashing room and restroom ever. Strike THREE.\n\nWill never go back again..."
0,"This place replaced a great little sandwich shop in an office complex.  I wish the other place could come back!  One morning I ordered a bagel (untoasted) and it was somehow moist and chewy.  No more Empire bagels for me!  I've gotten coffee there a few times, and both times they had their flavored coffee and regular coffee carafes mixed up so that if you wanted regular coffee you ended up with flavored coffee and vice versa.  I had a takeout salad from there for lunch one day when my employer ordered in lunch for us.  The salad was big and tasty, but I'm sensitive to preservatives and ended up with a raging headache by the end of the day.  I thought the chicken in my salad tasted a little salty as I ate it, so maybe it was the salad that gave me a headache, or maybe it was other things.  Either way, I'll bring my lunch next time if my employer wants to order from them again for convenience.  Now I walk across the street to Bruegger's Bagels if I want a quick sandwich or salad.  They have much better food and prices."
0,"Went here recently for the first time. It was okay. Unfortunately I ordered pasta. It was overcooked, and didn't even have the mushrooms and olives that I asked for. My husband got pizza, and I tried a bite. The pizza was good. We did have the garlic knots as an appetizer, and they were pretty good. Customer service was meh. The girl Aleah, who was serving us kept smiling like she was trying not to laugh. It made for a really awkward dinner. I'd come back for the pizza, but nothing else. I probably won't be back though. If I'm going out for pizza, I go to Venezia's Pizzeria. Their pizza is amazing, good prices, and their staff is really friendly."
0,"While they do an acceptable job at manicures and pedicures, the customer service is not up to par.  My experience here is that they are overbooked and understaffed.  It would make a big difference if they keep to the time they tell you to be there for an appointment, rather than saying they can take you \""now\"" and then have you wait.  That seems like a simple customer service fix.  I'll try a few different salons before returning here again."
0,"Went for dessert & drinks.  Bar service was a slow & desserts were meh.  Did like the location & that the front walls opened to the street, but that isn't enough to get me to go back. Too many other great options around the area to settle for meh."
1,"I thought Charlie Palmer's was great, but I didn't think it blew me out of the water like this is the place I need to go to for some delicious meat. \n\nWe were seated at a small table. Luckily my husband asked to move so that we could easily enjoy our meal with all the elbow room needed. We started off with the oysters and tuna tartar. Everything was on point and I could have had another half dozen oysters easily. They put just enough salt on the oysters to give it enough flavor. Tuna tartar was great! No stringy bits and it went down pretty smoothly. \n\nI wanted the surf and turf and that is what I got. My filet was pretty dang tender at medium rare and the lobster was good. The ritz cracker stuffing with the lobster wasn't my favorite though. It was really salty. My husband requested his steak to be medium rare as well but it looked like medium well to me. He didn't want to send it back and it was gone by the time I finished so I assumed he enjoyed it somewhat.  The Parmesan potatoes were a bit of a disappointment. It looked delish but the lack of seasoning was a turn off. It just tasted like mashed potatoes with no flavoring and a cheese crust on top. The artichokes were ok. It was nothing worth yelping about. I asked my husband how the sausage tasted in the artichoke and he said that I wouldn't  have enjoyed it. It looked like Vienna sausages from a can. \n\nThe s'mores bar was on the cut of the week menu (which is neat and budget friendly). I asked for that and they made it happen. It wasn't overly sweet and pretty good. The cookie ice cream sandwich was alright. I love soft cookies and I know hard cookies work well with ice cream sandwiches. \n\nOverall service was good. It did take some time for them to pick up my check but they have a lot of people working there. I am just not sure I would choose CP as my go to steakhouse. \n\nPS. The Pom martini was delish!"
1,"Love the opera renditions. Bring me to tears.\nMinus a star for Faith Hill and \""contemporary\"" selections.\n\nMy favorite thing in Vegas."
1,I come here M-Friday. Parking lot can become a nightmare and place is a little small But I come between 2:00-3:30 maybe till 4 and theres less people. I like that they have a side for only women that's a nice feature for people who are easily intimated or shy. Staff or people that come here are not snobby and bathrooms are clean. i pay 20 a month and no contract I can attend the fitness classes at that price if I wished.
1,"Lovely looking place with gorgeous high ceilings. Really nice coffee to be had here and every member of the staff is friendly and warm. I come here for lunch now and then as it is close to my office. The little toasts are always super good and come with all sorts of toppings: Russian egg salad, tuna, smoked salmon, various types of meat, etc. The desserts are all quite gorgeous looking as well, but usually I am too full to go there! I will say that it is kinda pricey, but at least the food is good, so that helps to take the sting out of the lunch bill.\n\nThey lose a star for saying that the soup was vegetarian...it had chunks of bacon and the guy shrugged when he saw me picking them out."
0,I personally thought this place was terrible. I ordered 2 cheese slices and I could barely eat it. I felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheap....I certainly didn't think it was tasty or anything like that.
0,"They have berrs listed in the menu that they cannot even get. They only serve Bud products in 22oz glasses. The food looks nothing like what is pictured in the menu. The food actually tastes like what you would expect for the price. Service is lacking and slow. If you complain to the manager, he acts as if you are the one with the problem! All of these isdues are pretty much what happened on the strip after the opening trainers left. I haven't been to that location since. We had hoped tgat this new location would be better...nope!"
1,Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere.
1,"Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again. \n\nFor our first course, I had the mediterranean salad and my wife had the poached pear on argula. Both were simply incredible for many reasons. First, for the creativity and composition of the ingredients such as falafel, hummus, tzaziki, etc. Second, for the quality, freshness and taste, Third, for the presentation and display. \n\nOur entrees raised the bar even higher. I had the grilled swordfish which came on a bed of capellini. My wife had the pork tenderloin on a sweet potato mash with asparagus. The flavors of both dishes had subtle spices as the hint of chipotle in the pork bbq sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we split a granny smith apple cobbler topped by a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream. It was not too sweet or tart and was the perfect ending to the meal."
1,"I really love playing pool here.  Some of the other reviewers seem to think it's in a bad neighborhood or something,  but I have never seen anything really sketchy happen there. Just seems like your run of the mill strip mall to me.  There is kind of a rowdy parking lot crowd on the weekends since Graham Central Station is in the parking lot , but nothing too crazy.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful and always check on you to make sure you are doing a okay.\n\nThey have a very large number of pool tables to play on hourly and per game.  Are they shiny and new? No not at all, but I like the \""Color of Money\"" neighborhood pool hall feel.  The few times I have encountered a loose pocket or something off with a table it's been fixed the next time I go in.\n\nThe hourly pool rates and food prices are very reasonable and the service is great.  Try the Onion Rings and the Sundae :) you won't regret it.  The other bar food they have is nothing new or different, but very good by bar standards.  \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars, but they have 3 nights a week they do pool leagues so you can't play during those times.  Which is cool I should probably join a pool league anyway.\n\nIf you play pool you should go in and have some fun."
1,The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub!
0,"I went to this location after flying in after a late night arrival. We went through the drive through at nearly 11 p.m and there were a few other cars in the drive through. Service was ok, and we moved through the line pretty quickly, but man... Is it me or is KFC going down the wayside for taste?? The taco bell was still the same horrible for me style that I love, and I'd come back for it, but the last couple times of KFC have been downright disappointing. The biscuit was hard and tasted funky, and the chicken itself was very gristly and just not that familiar flavor that kept me coming back. The prices seemed to be a bit higher too... I think I'll venture elsewhere for my late night cravings."
0,"Got to say this place has become a loser. the food has been bad every time we've tried it - Hey... a Ruben with no 1,000 island? fake onions rings made of mushy onion paste? A bartender that can't get more than one drink at a a time? bbq that's dried out and re-fried beans with NO taste? Sorry but other places deserve my money more. Not trying to be overly critical - just real. Too many options when dining out these days."
1,Such a beautiful attraction.  I love taking photos in front of this fountain.  BEST FREE SHOW IN VEGAS!\n\nTIP: There are a few restaurants you can dine at while watching the show (this isn't free though...lol)
0,"Had a coupon, as I usually do, and decided to get a Monster Taco. All I had to do was buy the drink and taco free!! Cool! I watched as a guy WITHOUT RUBBER GLOVES handled my taco and its ingredients!! He put it in the bag and, there I go!!! I asked the gal who was the cashier,\""Do they not wear gloves when handling tacos?\"" She looked around at him then said, \""We wash our hands!\"" OK, no more!! Too many other options."
1,"This restaurant has never fail on my Dinner every time I go  with my family the food is always delicious and a great experience  \nI'm very happy with Yesterday Dinner was Delicious \nThe restaurant was very clean \nThe host,waitress ,and the rest of the staff was very nice specially a Spanish speaker man he took care of Us and made sure we had everything we needed"
1,"Went here on a coupon. Great coupon deals by the way.\n\nGot a buy one get one free deal so i decided on a chicken plate and yakisoba. The co-owner was very nice through the whole ordering process and threw in a free macaroni salad for my first visit.\n\nThe food didnt meet my expectations but was very good. I was expecting a lot more flavors and assumed that if i got a plate it would at least come with some vegetables other then just meat and grain. Anyway lets break this down:\n\nBrown rice\nCooked perfectly had a very nice texture\n\nChicken\nHad really nice grilled taste seeing how it's grilled, the sauce was just poured over. Was expecting a lot more but the tasted of grilled meat with a sauce that complements it just shut me up and made me enjoy my food.\n\nVegetable Yakisoba\nMore like a chow mein then yakisoba. most likely would never order again.\n\nOverall the food wasn't exactly what i was expecting but was still very enjoyable with an energetic and welcoming co-owner"
1,"We are BIG fans of Area 51 as well as the former 21st Century Antiques, and everything that we have bought from Michael over 20 years in Madison is not only worth a great deal MORE than we paid for them, WE love them even more than when we bought them and couldn't find them again.\n\nMichael has a fantastic eye and the largest warehouse collection of eclectic modern furnishings, lighting and accessories in the area - art deco, arts & crafts, industrial-mid-mod century. Best to call for an appointment as hours are varied. \n\nBring your truck, tape measure and imagination as Area51 of course has a lot of truly one of a kind BIG pieces in addition to upscale kitsch, whimsy and collectible bling."
0,"If I were in charge of an M&M store on the strip, I would have:\n\n- free samples!\n- life-size huggable M&Ms\n- a demonstration of M&Ms melting in your mouth, not your hand, even in the Vegas desert \n- hot chicks and dudes clad only in M&Ms\n- a glamourous bar/lounge featuring candy-colored cocktails and novelty beer with M&Ms floating in it\n- a Cirque du Soleil show where the acrobats only wear M&Ms\n- high stakes poker with the life-size huggable M&Ms as dealers\n- strippers\n\nBut someone else is in charge of the M&M store on the Strip, and so it doesn't have any of those things. Instead it has:\n\n- four floors of stuff that says M&Ms on it for sale\n- a cheesy 3-D movie\n- a (probably cheesy) tour I didn't go on\n- NO FREE SAMPLES\n\nI guess that's probably more in line with the M&M brand than strippers, booze, and gambling, but then I don't really understand what they're doing on the strip. Whatever."
0,"Sorry wish I could rate the food, but three strikes and you're out. Tried to order online through the app and it wouldn't work (kept asking me to agree to the terms but there was no where to select that) then tried calling, couldn't get them to answer. Then just showed up at the store and waited five minutes but couldn't place our order and we noticed the in store prices were different then the pricing online. Didn't know ordering a pizza would be such an ordeal. So were taking this as a sign that the pizza Gods are intervening and we shouldn't have a pizza tonight. Probably will give papa johns our business tonight instead."
0,"This is the last of my visits to this location.  3 strikes and you are out.  Especially when its 0-3.  Since Chipotles inception, I have always had good experiences at all the locations I go to.  The only complaint I ever had was that it may have been too busy, but thats a good thing.  This location across from Scottsdale Fashion Mall is (To me) a horrible example.  95% of this is attributed to the staff there.2 out of 3 times Ive been there, they didnt have any Chicken at lunch time.  I can see once, but twice?  And then I was told 20minutes before it would be ready.  They didnt see that they were getting low and have it started.  Each time Im dealing with the staff on the line, they are inattentive at best.  No beans, they start to put beans on.  Ask for Fajita, they pass it by so I ask again.  Light Hot sauce, nahhhhh how bout a huge spoonful.  Light SC, nope..you want a giant glob of it.  Today I saw 8 people working.  somehow 1 of those 8 was making orders alone. (this is at 115 pm).  Finally as hes making mine some backup arrives.  Well at least I thought so...and then he leaves to take out trash with my poor burrito sitting in front of the cheese, incomplete.  He said someone finish that.  after 2min someone finally got some gloves on to finish it up and they instantly rolled it without asking me if it was done.  It wasnt.  So they unrolled it, made a gdamn disaster of it to finish it.  Guess what, it fell into 3 pieces when I took it out of the foil because of the gallon of hot sauce on it, and the re-roll.  Oh, how delicious, the fajitas were black/burnt too.  yum."
1,"My favorite location of Nutrition Rush. \n\nOnce you walk in, automatic help. If they don't have it they automatically tell you they can order it. Where as other locations when they don't have the product than you are S O L. They don't offer an alternative other than, \""sorry we don't have it.\"" \n\nVery convenient, located close to the Flamingo LVAC. I don't usually go to this location but it's by far my favorite because of the customer service. \n\nThey even call you when they have the product that you need which is pretty helpful. And they are pretty quick with the orders."
1,"The flagship Express @ the Forums in Caesar's has been a go to clothing store for me for years.  I love Express for their Men's dress shirts.  The best part of this location is that it is the flagship location in Vegas.  The benefit of the title and location come with exclusive designer label shirts, jeans, etc straight from the New York based location.  \n\nAnother awesome point that this store has always driven home to me is in the service department.  They have the largest location in town, but always manage to get me taken care of.  From the minute I walk into the store there is always a friendly, helpful face to help me find my way around.   By far, the best Express in town!"
1,Third time dining at Alessia's. As always the food was fantastic. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The owner John is down to earth and a professional. Pleasure speaking with him. Nice to enjoy great food and service in a family owned operation. Look forward to returning and passing word to friends about this gem in Mesa. Thanks again.

0,"I had just got of work and it was pouring rain and my ride bailed on me. I went into YoLove for cover from the rain while I called around to find a ride. I was in tears, wet, and frustrated. Someone came up to me, saw me crying, and then kicked me out. I couldn't even believe it. It was storming so hard traffic lights had gone out and trees were fallen on the street. \n\nSeriously, I will never buy from these assholes ever. I don't care how good their yogurt is. Who kicks a young crying girl out in the rain at night? Fuck you guys."
1,My mom was visiting and wanted a haircut.  She went to Eva and got the best cut I have ever seen on her. She has been getting tons of compliments on her new style. I guess now she'll have to come down and visit more often.
1,"I lift the weights and I put them down! This review is only for the actual free weights / gym area as I did not use any of the spa services.\n\nOne of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.\n\nThe facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.\n\nThe hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home.\n\nIt's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used."
0,This place has got to be the slowest Burger King on earth. It also doesn't help when someone in front of you orders $36 worth of food.
1,This place is pretty good. I was surprised. The service was just ok though.
1,"I'm gonna describe Tryst in these words \""Hella Good Music!!\"" haha though I'm not \""bay area\"" material, that's the only way I could explain Tryst.  We went here first for our drink tickets and then moved our way to XS, but Tryst convinced us to come back afterward because they play better music! If you're gonna play \""N***as in Paris\"" by Jay-Z and Kanye, you have me there all night! hahaha\n\nThey also have a pole available to dance on. I think this is essential for clubs because it gets people going! I've been here twice and I had great experiences both times."
1,"Awesome Mac & Cheese!\n\nSITREP\n\nI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.\n\nTHE MAC MENU\n\nMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate \""Classic American Eats\"", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION!\n\nBFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \""cheesification\"".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further."
1,"When the sushi monster hits, all you can eat sushi seems to be the only thought in our minds. Lucky for us, we live close to a huge selection of AYCE sushi restaurants. In order to narrow it down, I phoned around checking AYCE prices and Naka was the only one that had a great affordable dinner price - $21.95. The other places were asking about $24 and up. \n\nThis place is a legit Japanese owned and run establishment (The chefs, all of the waitresses, and a lot of locals at the bar were Japanese). This place is a local gem and I'm so glad we came here. Great price for AYCE sushi, a nice big selection, the fish was super fresh and tasty, the fish to rice ratio wasn't too bad, and the service was great! \n\nLet's talk about what we ordered:\n\nSashimi plate (1 per person) - the sashimi was fresh and sweet. We got salmon, yellow tail, and tuna. 5/5\n\nSalmon - my first love, they are sweet and buttery 5/5\n\nWhite tuna - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5\n\nAlbacore - great firm texture and sweetness 5/5\n\nHalibut - very fresh and sweet and melts in your mouth 5/5\n\nYellow tail - super sweet, buttery and fresh 5/5\n\nUnagi - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5\n\nAma ebi - (1 per person) we loved that they offer sweet shrimp in the all you can eat meal, yet, it was ok, the sweet shrimp was small and a little different than what we're used to - maybe it wasn't as fresh? We loved the fried heads though. It was fried to perfection! 3/5\n\nUni - (1 per person) my boyfriend loved it, he said it was very sweet, very fresh, and very good uni. 5/5\n\nTamago - I loved it! It was homemade and tasted like it was made with love. 5/5\n\nMiso soup x 3 - the miso soup here is so good. They came out at the perfect hot temperature. Nice bits of tofu and seaweed. Great miso flavor but not too salty. This is how a miso soup should taste! 5/5\n\n2 different rolls (Mark and Kara) - the rolls weren't bad, simple and filling. I probably would just stick to nigiri next time. 3/5\n\nBaked mussels (2) - very simple and not impressive, I would skip it next time. 2/5\n\nFried tempura jalape\u00f1os - they were hot and crispy - not spicy at all - but we enjoyed them. 5/5\n\nBeef wrapped asparagus - these were in a teriyaki sauce, the beef was super tender and flavorful. I loved these! I could eat 5 more plates. 5/5\n\nStrawberry Mochi - (1 sliced in half) typical boxed mochi ice cream, but it was yummy and a great palate cleanser! 5/5\n\nGreen tea ice cream - nice green tea flavor and we both loved how it wasn't too sweet. 5/5\n\nThis is a perfect option for the budget conscious AYCE connoisseur, but I have become obsessed with Sakana lately so you might catch me over there AYCE'ing it up."
0,"When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \""certified technicians\"" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else."
1,Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.
0,This airport makes no sense and has gotten to big for its britches.  The gates layout sucks and you can't tell who is coming or going.  It is hot and there are very limited charging stations.  The TSA folks all had their Cheerios peed in and were very rude.  The rental car area while nice is a 20min bus ride.  All in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport.
1,"Another incredible Henderson park here!  This feels like a wonderful gift from the city to the public because it's such an amazing place!  With Black Mountain as a backdrop, in a beautiful tucked away location, this park has everything for the outdoorsy type.  Here you'll find the trailhead for Amargosa trail; a walking course that offers amazing city views at the top; children's playground and splashpad; a dog park with separate enclosures for small dogs and all dogs; a skate park; basketball courts; and barbecues for those perfect days to enjoy an outdoor meal with friends/family.  I'm so glad this is my local park!"
1,"You'll find this grub inside a seedy yet surprisingly clean bar called moon doggies.  I told Chris, the Naked City Pizza Owner, I 'd be scared to patronize this joint at night. He is assured me it's cool...mostly industry folk.\n\nTook hubs and dad in for lunch.  Strangely enough, we didn't have any pizza.  I know this guy is from Buffalo so we decided to try his buffalo wings.  We also tried the steak frites sub (a special written on the board).  Dad had a chili cheese hot dog with everything and fries.\n\nThe wings were good.  We ordered them \""hot\""  The were great!  Cooked just as I like them.\n\nDad loved his hot dog.  It had chili, cheese, pickles, onions, jalapenos and so on.  He didn't love his fries.\n\nThe steak frites sub was a monstrous roll coated with cheese and stuffed with garlicky beef, creamy horseradish, and skinny fries.  It was served with a side of peppery gravy to drizzle over the top.  The sandwich was excellent.  Lots of meat.  Perfectly seasoned.  Yum-o!\n\nOur lunch for three was $25 and we brought some home.\n\nI\""ll definitely go back soon to try the pizza!!"
0,Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague
0,"I wish I could give this Walgreens Pharmacy a negative star review. The customer service here is horrible. I was rushed and made to feel like a complete pain in the ass because they had to put my insurance card in. If you don't like you're job then leave, don't work in a customer service industry if you are awful at interacting with the public. Walgreens should reexamine who they have working in the pharmacy here. I haven't interacted with all employees but the Asian woman in the pharmacy is the worst. I won't be returning to this location for anything because of this."
1,"visit: 7/14/2011 7pm.\nI am the hamburglar.\nI can't get enough damn hamburgers, I could eat one a day,seriously.\nI heard of this place from my sister who does nothing but rave,wear their shirts, and apparently gets free sodas.\nI thought the 50's motif was pretty cool-seems like the way of the diner has damn near gone the way of the dinosaur,here in Vegas. They have all the decor and look, plus they actually play music from the 50's that everyone is singing in there,lol.\nI was impressed by the extensive menu options, mind you,there aren't many types of things to order,for example:\nSpecialize in a few types of burgers, but tons of available toppings at no extra charge. you can customize your soda, milkshake, malt, coffee, and sundae/banana split. Also they serve fries and onion rings with different dipping sauces.\nI don't know about you, but I am a HUGE SUCKER for variety/choices and this place fit the bill. \n\nour food order:\nMe-1/3 hamburger,done med. pickles,tomato,lettuce,fresh onion.\nhubby-angus cheeplatter with salad,onion rings\nkiddo-fried mac and cheese with carrots and ranch in flaming car!!\n\nAs far as burgers go, we both agreed the outside seemed a little underdone, and I did notice there wasn't any seasoning,but still good.\n\ndrink order:\nme-pear,mango shake a soda,free refills!! 1/2 banana-chocolate-PB shake (half size seemed big, it was as big as my soda!)\nkiddo-birthday cake shake\n\nAll of us tasted each others things and were very pleased. My shake was fricken amazing, and I'm glad I didn't order anything else.I  was stuffed.\n\nI heard of bad reviews mostly consisting of slow service-we had one waiter covering the whole damn store, and he was quick to refill and take away everything. Love it. good job Chris.\n\nFinish the big hamburger and get your pic on the wall when you walk in.\nAn overall really cool place I will definitely return. Just wish it wasn't in BFE"
0,"I finally had a chance to try out Joe's last night with my family.  I hate to say it (I really wanted to like the place) but I wasn't very impressed overall.  The food quality overall was very average, nothing stood out as phenomenal from any of our choices (we sampled from each other's plates).  Not to say anything was bad, just not superb.  The portions were a little small for the price.\n\nAll in all it was an okay experience, but the price ($40 for 2 adults and 2 kids) is high enough to keep us from going back."
1,"I absolutely love Cosmo.  Not only are the new restaurants pretty darn good, but it's visually stunning.  I love the lobby area from the main entrance, where the columns are large screens.  Not to be vulgar, but it's a visual mindf&^k.  Don't come here stoned.  Trust me.\n\nAnyway, great restaurants, great discounts and rewards with their casino card (free), so grab one.  If you give your name and number they'll give you $10 to play on the slots.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with a sparkly, shiny, hip hotel like the Cosmo."
1,"After TCC Family Hair Care on 19th and Northern closed for good I was faced with the daunting task of finding another place to get my haircut that is halfway decent and not overly expensive. After prodding around on Yelp.com for a place that has been reviewed (not negatively) and and isn't too expensive, I found Joe's Barber Shop. And I have to say, I am glad I did. \n\nThis place bills itself as a \""European barbershop\"", but I am not actually sure what that means so I have no idea if it is an accurate description or not. But clearly Joe and his wife Alla are from somewhere in Eastern Europe and so are the other gals that were working there when I stopped in on a Wednesday morning to get a haircut. The chairs there are big and comfortable and there was a nice TV on and plenty of seating for other folks. It had a welcoming vibe I would say. Much more so than a SuperCuts or other franchise family salons. It was also clean and looked like a business that was well taken care of with good equipment. I was glad to see this.\n\nThe haircut was great. The gal who helped me (can't remember her name) did a really good job and really took her time with me. She gave me a nice razor shave on my neckline and a great cut overall. I was super happy. It was $12.00 + plus tip and I got a nice 30 minute haircut, which was meticulous and one of the best cuts I've had in years. I was almost mad upon leaving when I realized that I wasn't getting nearly the time or the cut at other places I had been to around my neighborhood. \n\nBottom line: \n\nJoe's is great overall. They gave me an exceptional cut at a great price and I left the place thinking \""I am definitely coming back again\"". Maybe I will do so earlier than I am used to as I feel like I can get good service and it makes me want to come back sooner to keep my hair looking neat and trim.\n\n...and I don't EVER rush to come out of pocket for anything, so that's saying a lot."
0,"I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,"
1,Never had a bad meal here. Love their Singapore noodles plus service is great
1,Excellent!\nI love the ambiance of this restaurant. We were seated next to window with a peek of the fountain show. Foie grois was great and hamachi was good. I ordered medium duck. Unfortunately it was not seasoned well & was too chewy. Server was in tuned & offered to exchange dish for a sea bass. It was delicious!
0,"Less than expected.  Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside, but bland tasting.  I ordered their sauce, but ended up with only ketchup.  Fries were soggy, oily, and horrible.  It took a good 35 min for my food.  Overall, very underwhelming."
0,"Not sure how others are rating this place.  If you rate on the steak, they get 2 stars at best.  It was tough, dry and needed some A1 sauce or something even more pedestrian to grant it a bit of flavor.  I've had far better steaks at Outback.  Lone Star is another $20 steak joint that bests this place with ease (and half the price).  Ambiance was nice.  Service was good (not great).  Cocktails were good.  Presentation was OK.  When I pay that much for a steak, I expect a lot from it.  I was very disappointed.  Maestros, Mortons, Flemings, etc. all charge roughly the same but they are by far the preferred choice.  I'm thinking there are some shills rating this place higher than it deserves or they just haven't been to one of the other sites for true Prime beef cooked to perfection."
1,"Making my rounds of the steakhouses here in Vegas and this is a must stop for me.  There are 2 CG's in the L.A./O.C. area and I thought I'd try the one here in Vegas, since the restaurant is situated to have spectacular views of the strip.  In our case the Wynn and Encore and southward.  \n\nThe entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!\n\nI knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!\n\nI guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday \""cake.\"" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.\n\nThe service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.\n\nI may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me."
0,"They have a decent selection but make sure to look at the expiration dates of the condoms you buy here. They frequently sell expired condoms. Or at least, condoms with incorrect expiration dates. I have better luck buying condoms at gas stations. Watch out."
1,"A friend decided to have her birthday shindig here and I have to say it was a great choice.  We had a party of 20 something including kids, so the space alone was nice to have. Everyone stayed entertained whether it was sitting in the comfy chairs/couches chatting away or playing a little cornhole and ping pong. We were there at least 5 hrs and I wouldn't have minded staying longer if I had the time.  Our server Britney was amazing! She was on top of it the entire time and super friendly.  Our entire group kept saying how great the service was. Not just Britney, but everyone helping her deliver everything we ordered. Will  definitely be back and will recommend to everyone! Thank s for a great experience!!"
0,Brunch was garage save your time and  money and go to a real breakfast place.  2 hours for the wrong order of eggs and bacon.
0,"Came here for dinner while visiting family.\n\n- Food: Well, it IS a buffet. Sushi selection was terrible and everything was obviously not fresh. Hibachi steak was dry. My ice cream had freezer burn.\n+ Price: Cheap for a buffet\n+ Atmosphere: Typical Chinese buffet layout. Good for groups.\n- Service: Unprofessional. Waiters yelling across the room is not very pleasant.\n- Recommendation: Nope."
1,"It doesn't get any better\n\nI've had the opportunity of attending two Arizona Cardinals games at University of Phoenix Stadium.  All I have to say it is always a great experience.  I've been to a few stadium across the country and the Cardinals  have one of the better stadiums I've visited.  The Cardinals stadium has  comfortable seating, awesome views from anywhere, spacious walkways, lots and lots of amenities  (food, washrooms and a fan shop) and more then enough parking for tailgating.\n\nRemember to get to the stadium early  before a game, so you can take advantage of all the great restaurants.  Don't forget statium personnel screen everyone coming in, and are strict with the NFL's new bag policies (ladies- get a wristlet or buy one of the clear tote bags).\n\nSo if you get a chance head to the stadium to check it out."
1,"Its a small shop, ideal for a browse, especially when you have time to spare. The stock is sort of overflowing and you can find all sort of trinkets, jewelry,  memorabilia, books. Downstairs you will find a lot of books, packed everywhere. It gives you the idea of the place where one mans rubbish is another mans treasure and you can spend an age in here.\n\nMost definitely worth a visit if antiques and rummaging through such stores is your thing."
1,"\""Is it yucky?\"" a friend asked me of the Movies 10 in Matthews. Many discount theaters get a reputation for having sticky seats, funky smells, and screaming children, but the Matthews 10 is an exception to the $2 theater rule. I've had only good experiences there.\n\nOn Mondays, there's a bonus discount. Tickets are only $.50, which is absolutely awesome. While they've got cheap tickets, their concessions are still pretty prices, so you might want to bring along your big purse and stop at the gas station on the way there (if you know what I'm sayin'). \n\nI tend to hit this spot up about once a week, as I'm just not willing to spend what the mainstream theaters are charging for movies. If you wait a month or so after the new stuff comes out, it finds its way almost always to the Matthews 10. \n\nIt's nearby a few fun chain restaurants as well. I have made a whole date night out of Cici's pizza and a Matthews 10 movie for less than $20. It can be done!"
1,"The better half and I just closed on our house, which happens to have a very large, and beautiful pool. We want to keep it that way, so pool service is a must. I heard about Honest Pool Care from my brother-in-law who speaks very highly of them.\n\nIn that I am heading out of town, I wanted get an estimate ASAP. I spoke with the manager Steve, who said he would call the owner Kevin and try to have him come same day. Kevin was able to come within in hour of my call ( he was in the hood!) and he was awesome. \n\nIn that I am a first time pool owner, I really needed some Pool Maintenance 101. I thought I filled it with water and would be done with it, turns out there are pumps and motors and filters and blah blah my head hurts. Kevin explained to me how everything works, and gave me a clear idea of everything I need. He explained how my filter is a bit small for my pool, 300 gallons vs 500, but he was very chill and indicated as a brand new home owner, it is not high on the priority list, that I can wait until it stops working - which I found comforting, in that I'm already terrified by the all the bills I'm just now realizing I have to pay.....(.Home depot ads just took on a whole new meaning) I liked that Kevin didn't come over and just start trying to sell me stuff. \n\nWe then talked about equipment. I don't have any, and my pool is currently full of leaves. Kevin explained all the different models of vacuums, in relation to my awkward shaped pool, and the diving board. He explained the pro's and cons of each, and told me he could sell one to me, or simply show me the model he had in mind and I could buy it online. ZERO PRESSURE to buy from him, just very straight forward, matter of fact and down to earth. I have worked in sales my whole career, and I really liked his tone. \n\nAs for the service, we agreed upon a monthly rate which I think is very fair. He explained to me how sometimes rates can adjust as equipment is needed, but I  shouldn't expect any surprises in my bill, and I will be alerted anytime a larger fix is needed. \n\nI will update the review once I have continued ongoing service, but for now the customer service was top notch, and Kevin is totally the kind of guy you would invite over for a BBQ."
0,I have been to the Tanning room 3 times now and have had an extremely pleasant experience. \n\nThe two younger ladies who are usually there are very helpful and somewhat friendly. Although there is an older gentleman who is not friendly in fact rude. \n\nThe rates are above average but not by much maybe .50 to 1.00 more per session than the competition. \n\nOverall I will probably use the remainder of my sessions and move on.
0,"$40 for guys, never a problem.\n$40 for this \""performance\"" of a bunch of idiots screaming into the mic claiming it's \""hiphop,\"" problem.\n$10-15 for mixers that literally had a jigger poured shot, not good.\n\nAs I looked upon all the 45yr old women who looked like they were \""waiting to be found,\"" I saw the gaze in their eyes and became saddened by this.\n\nThe \""Gaze at Haze,\"" was sad.\n\nWe left."
1,"Where to start where to start? So my friend and myself wanted to experience the gay nightlife in Las Vegas for our trip, I had heard about piranha from another friend so we decided to stop on by. \n\nThere are things I do like and things I don't, I'm going to be right upfront and say the stupidest thing for me is the $25 minimum on a cards, they do provide an ATM with a low fee amount but still, come on people! Who pays in case anymore!!! \n\nThe biggest plus was it was easy to get to and just for checking in on yelp you get a free drink, I mean what's not to love? The down side is when you start buying your own your spending $8.50 for barly 1 shot of booze per drink! :-/ I don't know if I'm just hard core used to SD clubs but yea that's not enough for me! Haha\n\nTo sum it up it was. Great time. I would go again and in fact we came two nights in a row. Fun environment and worth the cons."

I will call your head office for such an incompetent service.\nNo surprised, Maghan (the blonde girl) gave me bad number for customer service. However, I found one"
1,"Being a Texas Native and foodie. This place is legit. Being my first time here thanks to a Yelp search for chicken fried steak this was on top of the list, I had to check it out. Seeing the decor on the wall I had to make a Texas License Plate donation because after two years of being here I finally caved in and registered my car in AZ and coincidentally had it in my trunk. This donation yielded the opportunity to meet Steve the owner. Steve was awesome we chatted about Tex-Mex food and life in Texas. It was delightful meeting him. \n\nNow on to the food. We ordered a dish on their daily special of biscuits topped with a chicken fried steak topped with eggs. This may sound weird but that's how you eat them in Texas. Food was killer. Steve was also generous in bringing us a sample of his BBQ brisket and mash potatoes. Again legit Texas style food. As BBQ competition person whose tasted some of the best BBQ in Texas I have to give two thumbs up, all the food had great flavor. And we even tried the cobbler topped with Bluebell ice cream. Which if it had anything other than Bluebell than that would be a sin. \n\nWe will be back to try other menu items and next time go with a bigger appetite."
1,Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car
1,"After reading Nelson's review, I had to try this place.  It is hiding in plain sight.  I can't believe the number of times I've passed on the freeway and saw that large open shopping plaza, much of it empty, and little did I know there was a gem of a restaurant right in my line of sight.\n\nI stopped here after a \""Showgirls of Las Vegas\"" program at the Nevada State Museum.  I was the only customer at 5:10 and remained the only customer for the hour I was there.  It's a shame.  They should have more business.\n\nI got the chips and salsa and I asked for the hot salsa.  That salsa with habanero peppers is quite good.  The mild salsa is fine, too, and I liked the small bits of avocado in the mild salsa.\n\nThe woman brought me a bowl of complimentary soup. It was not the vegetable soup shown in other photos for Chicken Itza but rather a noodle soup--fideo soup.  It was very good and very hot!!  Let it cool for awhile so you don't burn your lips, tongue, throat, and anything else to which this may come in contact!\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the panuchos.  Since there are three to an order, I got one, chicken, one turkey, and one pork (cochinita pibil).  All three were excellent!  The split tortilla filled with refried black beans with the tasty meat and toppings were super!! The meats were very juicy and this was a more than one napkin experience.  The meat could have been a bit hotter, but it didn't detract from the flavors.\n\nFor dessert, I had arroz con leche which was not complimentary.  It is really, really, good!  It had a nice amount of cinnamon, raisins, and bananas and there seemed to be some pieces of crust as if the rice and milk were baked in a pie crust of some kind.\n\nThe horchata was very good. \n\nI'm coming back to try their other Mayan (Yucatan) specialties!  It is so wonderful to live in such a diverse city with all these different foods from which to choose."
0,"The facilities are beautiful but this place is POORLY run.\nWe stayed here for a wedding and they lost the bride and groom's reservation not once, but twice!\nThe father of the bride was also given keys to a room that was already occupied. He discovered this little mistake when he walked into a room with undergarments thrown all over the place. \nThe most irritating aspect is they did nothing make up for all the mistakes."
1,"Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill was a great place to eat while in Vegas.  If you are part of the Identity rewards of Cosmopolitan you get points for your purchase.  This is a great place to have a birthday dinner at.\n\nMy wife and I ate here as a treat for my wife's birthday away from the kids.  The service was great as our water cups were never empty and the staff was very friendly.  My wife got a free dessert for here birthday.\n\nMy wife ordered the spicy lobster roll (~$17) which was a small roll and tasted great (4 stars).  I ordered the Cosmopolitan (~$85) which is a mix of sashimi and sushi (4 stars).  Cosmopolitan according to the waiter is the more adventurous sashimi and sushi platter on the menu.  I requested one medium blue fin belly on the platter which they did do.  Wish they had Toro available as it was sold out before we got there.  It also had a nice selection of unique fish and a pretty cut up mackerel in the middle with about 8 pieces of mackerel sashimi coming from the cut up fish.  Most of the platter was rarer fish with great flavor.  I did wish it had something more unique than mackerel for the center piece.  We ended the meal with the free dessert which was anything they offered and my wife chose the banana split.  It was one of the best banana splits I have ever eaten.  The dish is made of one good banana cut in half length wise and place on the bottom of three scopes of ice cream of chocolate, green tea, and ginger flavors.  Ginger ice cream is pretty unique in flavor and pretty good.  It was topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and macadamia nuts.  As it was my wife's birthday a candle was placed on top which was a nice touch.\n\nThis is a place I will visit again as it has great selection of fresh fish and great service.  Overall it is a 4 or 4.5 star place as it is one of the better places I have been but pricey."
1,You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
0,"I really expected more from all the hype I'd heard surrounding this place. It's near my work and I'd heard their food was amazing. After visiting them 4 different times for business lunches and a birthday party, aside from some decent Fried pickles, you'll find nothing more than below average bar food and sandwiches. I would steer clear and ignore this overrated sentimental bar and grill."
0,"Get'em  in and Get'm out!\n\nAnother stop for my DDD list.  I am not sure why I keep falling for this.  Of course the food was,\""Killer!\"", like everything Guy seems to eat. \nWell the crab cake, what we started with, was not \""Killer.\""  It was mushy, under seasoned, and tasted and had a texture more like paste in the inside than lump crab. \n\nI had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the blackened salmon, both totally edible, in fact they weren't bad.  I wish that the sauce on my grits was a little more viscous.  It began to get watery at the end.  My friend enjoyed the Salmon, but apparently it was slightly over seasoned in areas.  \n\nMy partners main complaint was that the portion size did not match the price.  For the price maybe the salad should come with the meal.  Also they're grits for crying out loud!  It's cheap hominy corn.  Put some more of them on the plate with the four shrimp.  It was an entree right?  \""How long does it take you to cook your grit?\""  Joe Pesci fans, Unite!\n\nThey had a special memorial day dessert, it was for the troops of course, so we tried it.  It was advertised to us as a cobbler, but it ended up being more of a shortcake type of dessert.  Never-the-less it was delicious and we gobbled it up.\n\nThe final downer was the being rushed, but we're not rushing you atmosphere.  I hadn't even got my full ass in the seat before the waitress was asking us what we wanted to drink.  How about bring us some water and a menu.  I almost stabbed a bus boy with my fork when he attempted to grab my plate before my last bite was gone.  Actually it was the last bite of my friends salmon, but jeeshhhhh, ASK!  I may have wanted to lick the plate, not really, but I like to keep my options open!\nPlate Lickers Unite!"
0,"Normally, if we walk out of a restaurant feeling hungry ,still, I would give it one star. But the food here is good, actually, a lot better than the other ones I have been to in PHX area. \nWe don't expect to take leftovers home, but need to be able to wait 4-5 hours before we need to look for food again. When we walked out Takeda that day, my husband said, \""we got to find something else.\"" I had two restaurants myself in the past. One thing I learned is; if you want your customers to return, you have to at least make sure they are not leaving your restaurant hungry!"
1,"After a super early flight into Phoenix, our party of 16 was quite hungry. I've read about the hype of U.S. Egg, but had to have a taste of it myself.  The verdict is in and this place is for real.  \n\nThey have a very large menu and everyone in the party seemed to like what they got.  The biggest surprise was the bloody mary's were freaking excellent.  The waitress didn't miss a beat with our large party.  Food came out quickly and warm.

0,"I'm a Chicago native living in Vegas for a while now and I get the usual cravings for Chicago food.\n\nI was in the mood for hot dogs tonight so I decided to try Tasty Dogs for the first time. \n\nI've read the other reviews here and I really wanted this place to be great, but unfortunately it didn't live up to them.\n\nAlthough they had all the right ingredients, Vienna beef dogs, neon green relish, poppy seed buns, sport peppers, etc, the final dogs served to me were pretty sub par.\n\nFirst- one of the buns had a stale end- like the end was hanging out of the package and dried up. How do you serve a customer a rock hard bun? Next they really skimp on the toppings, Two TINY slices of tomato (seriously looked like they sliced a cherry tomato as thin as possible. A pickle spear on the dog looked like it was shaved off the pickle with a vegetable peeler. Then just a bare minimum of the other toppings covered the dog.\n\nI understand this stuff is mostly all shipped in from Chicago and it's expensive, but I'm paying a premium- the 2 dog special is $8.99 + tax!!! For that kind of money, give me a decent topped dog on a fresh bun! I felt pretty gypped.\n\nThe one good thing I can mention are the hand cut thin fries- very tasty.\n\nI may go back and try the gyros and Italian beef and hope it gets made with a little more care. Maybe I just had an unusual bad experience."
0,"The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \""Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\"". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food."
1,"One of the best quickie Mexican take-out joints in the valley for everything from simple carne asada tacos to chicharrones en salsa roja. I love that they have authentic, non-Americanized carne options like buche (pig intestines), tripas (beef intestines), lengua (tongue- best I've ever had), and cabeza (beef head). And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.\n\nIf they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable. \n\nThey make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)\n\nMake sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.\n\nThe only issue I've ever had is with consistency. Sometimes a burrito will have rice and beans, other times it will be a meat-o-palooza. Not that big of a deal, and certainly nothing that will keep me away from the best quickie Mexican I've had in the valley."

The AC unit smelled like burnt electrical wire and the carpets looked like someone may have puked all over the place. I wouldn't reccommend this place to a homeless bum! \n\nOh and don't stroll the lobby, you're liable to get shot."
1,I was needing pizza's for a customer as close to 11am as possible. I called around to 5 other pizza places who had no interest in helping me. I called them and told them my predicament and they were more than willing to help me. Not to mention their pizza was very good!!! Thank you!
1,"Was in today for 4 new tires for my truck.  Made an appointment online, and was glad I did.  There was a line outside the store before they opened (appointment was for 8am).  They opened a few minutes early instead of making us wait outside, and Kyle came outside and greeted me BY NAME.  He knew who I was because I put in my vehicle information on the reservation, VERY IMPRESSIVE.  Seemed like my truck was on the lift BEFORE I had even finished paying.  I was out the door in no time.  Loyal customer for life.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Thanks guys!"
0,"If you're into great craft beer, don't waste your time here. The cask conditioned IPA tastes like dish water. Food was average. Meh."
1,"I just want to say that the Snappers these guys are now selling are delicious.  I have not been to the restaurant. I live in Paradise Valley Arizona.  But at Costco I just picked up their newest creation.  Snappers.  OMG the best.  If you like salty and sweet, chocolate and carmel, you will love love love Snappers."

The blinds look like they have not been cleaned in FOREVER!!\nIf I were eating there (never) I would have been more than a little freaked out.\nYes it is a chain, so no points there, it is the same as the last time I had the misfortune of being in a Dennys..."
0,"I really don't understand the hype. I've been going to Bacchanal the past couple of times I've been to Vegas but all my friends keep telling me to try Wicked Spoon. Sooooo, giving in to the peer pressure, I decided to make a visit on a Saturday at 2PM. \n\nMy first warning should have been that the place was pretty empty and lines nonexistent. I mean, I've been to Bacchanal on a TUESDAY at the same time and had to get a number to get back INTO line later. As I was walking through the stations, I noticed the appalling fact that there were so few selections! Even in the salad/seafood bar, there were barely any items to choose from compared to many other lower-end buffets in Vegas. \n\nPer Yelper suggestions, I tried the pork belly and the Mac 'n cheese to start, along with the compulsory sushi selections. The sushi was decent, the Mac 'n cheese bland, and the pork belly disappointing. I also had a chance to try some sirloin, prime rib, and thick-cut bacon. Everything was just ok - the beef was tough, dry, and extremely salty. Even the horseradish couldn't save it. The mashed potatoes and the jalape\u00f1o creamed corn was better than the meat selection unfortunately. The bone marrow was a unique dish but wasn't as delicious as I would've hoped. The steamed crab was good - I appreciated that they had this hot option, but they also didn't have any butter to dip the crab in. How... odd. The ramen was decent, but again, I appreciated that they had this selection and even offered up an egg with it. The dessert selection was again, both sparse and disappointing. Nothing tasted exceptionally delicious except for the gelato. The Thai tea gelato was really the savior of the night, just is really something quite sad to say for a buffet. \n\nService was attentive in the beginning but lacking towards the end of our meal. We asked for a Coke and was given Pepsi. It would've been better if they just told just they don't have Coke. \n\nOverall, I would STRONGLY suggest going to Bacchanal Buffet if you're looking for a higher-end buffet. Everything about Wicked Spoon was a wicked disappointment. :("
0,"I went in here with a friend for their lunch buffet. It's definitely got very good ambiance and location. Everything's a bit fancier than the usual Indian place. Fancy ceilings, plush carpet, cute buffet setup, comfy booths. But the buffet fare was definitely lacking a bit of excitement. They only had a limited variety and I go to many indian lunch buffets, so I know the standard options. But this place didn't have paneer! or Korma! However, they carried carrot pudding so that was something to point out. Drier than usual but it was still pretty good. The servers were very nice but also very forgetful, maybe she was new but her attitude about everything was very pleasant. \nI wouldn't come here again but was glad to have tried out another Indian joint."
1,"OMG....Get in your car and go now!!! \n\nI live close, and have seen the signage but was leery of trying Pasta China, untill I read the reviews. So I called my foodie friend, she picked me up and off we went!\n\nWe sampled a LOT of food, lol. I think the waitress was concerned because we ordered so much.  But we are sample & doggie bag girls. We had 3 apps 3 dinners and 2 desserts....\n\nRangoons sp? Holy cow! Even hubby liked them, and he is really picky.\nPotstickers,  very tasty\nFusion pizza eggroll, reeeeealy good!\n\nGarlic chicken alfredo, I liked it, wish there was more garlic\nCashew chicken, I liked it a lot, but had more sugar than I am comfortable with, I am diabetic.\nFusion Pasta China.......TADA! Ya it was that good.\n\nFusion Cannoli eggroll, WTH?   BEST  cannoli I have EVER eaten!\nLemon bar, I did not care for it. I want LEMON, mouth pucker and all. But my friend really liked it.\n\nFor all that, and we took 3 boxes and a baggie home, bill was under $30. I left $35 and the waitress tried to give me money back.  Oh no, we meant to leave that tip, it was that good...We will be back!\n\nFYI, friend said bathroom was clean. They have wifi, and they also have comfy couch seating at 2 tables\n\nPs the menu has changed, i will take photos next time i go!"
1,"I am always a fan of PF Chang's, but the one in Las Vegas had a special menu where large groups can order by paying per person and get unlimited appetizers and entrees,  I think we paid $27pp and got two appetizers and 4 entrees along with white and brown rice.  If we ran out of anything, they would bring out more.  The food was good and the service was excellent.  The only downside was the excruciatingly long wait.  They said 45 minutes, but it ended up being a hour and a half!"
0,Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.
0,This is easily the worst supermarket in Montr\u00e9al. They actually follow you around the store to make sure you don't steal anything. And when you finally do make it to the checkout counter with your rotten vegetables... The cashiers never say hello. Never!
1,I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!
1,"My wife and I showed up at 10 minutes to closing with no reservations and the manager gave us the 411.  He said he would seat us immediately but didn't want us to feel rushed as they would be trying to take our order right away.  Well they walked us in and no one rushed us for anything.  Our bussboy had our water constantly filled and our waiter took time with us too, helping my wife to choose a wine with her dinner.  I of course had the Prime rib and it was wonderful (and large).  I also had the sides of garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  My wife had the asparagus and sauteed mushrooms and topped it off with a large salad.  The atmosphere was a cross between romantic and peaceful, which is no small feat when you have a casino right outside your doors.  When my wife and I finally gave up trying to finish everything, it was all packaged up for us and we enjoyed it the next day.  Our bussboy, the waiter and the manager were all very cordial and they turned a last minute meal into a very nice food affair for us."
1,The food I had here was absolutely delicious. Lemon skinny pancake and quiche Lorraine. I expected the quiche to be either a slice or a small whole quiche but it was quite large and came with a lovely little green salad. \n\nWe sat on the indoor patio and didn't have to wait at all on Sunday at 10:30. The service was nice (though a bit slow) and so was the view.
0,"Service so poor, they would not even let me in. I came with 6 friends, 3 guys and 4 girls. Excellent ratio, no? We dressed to the nines, waited in line. \n\nGot near the front and I was stopped by a bouncer who searched my bag, and then told me that I was not allowed to go in because of my camera gear. It was just my SLR with some lenses and a flash. The bouncer granted entry to everyone else with cameras and smartphones, but not me. Maybe he was also a photography hobbyist and was simply jealous of my equipment? Maybe he was worried about me being a paparazzi, even though my gear was nowhere near paparazzi status and I was clearly here, dressed up, with my friends, to have a good time?\n\nIf you are going to have customers post photos of your venue on Yelp, they might as well be good photos. Now they can keep their bad photos and bad publicity. I'll keep my Tao Nightclub virginity."
0,"Today was my second time going to Parkway House Family Restaurant and I did not enjoy it.\n\nA week ago a friend of mine introduced me to is and I ordered the porkchops, eggs, and toast breakfast. It was delicious! My friend's daughter got Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and my friend got a BLT Sandwich with egg. Everything came out quick, made to order, and delicious. Our waitress was real friendly and quick to get us refills and checked on us regularly. I knew I'd have to come back.\n\nToday I go with a different friend and order a bologna and egg sandwich (add cheese, tomato, and lettuce) while she got a bacon, sausage, and egg sandwich (add cheese). We both ordered hashbrowns with add ins (cheese, mushrooms, onions, ham). We waited a good 20 minutes for our food and then it came out cold and the hashborwns were burnt/rubbery chewy and disgusting. I added tomato and egg onto my sandwich but it was not on my sandwich when it arrived. I asked for it and it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring it out. Upon bringing it to me she says, \""I'm glad you didn't eat it all because I forgot about you!\"" in a happy, peppy sort of voice. By then, my food was more than cold and I was not happy. I decided against my meal and she kindly took it away and marked it off the ticket. She waited on the people behind us and told them \""You can't go wrong with breakfast!\"" and they got their meal within 5 minutes of placing their order! I found the waitress I had on the first visit and placed a bologna sandwich to go and told her the last one came out cold.\n\nThe menu is very fairly priced (which is what gave it one star) and some service is very good (another star).  They serve breakfast all day, which was why we decided to go there when we did. The second visit was very disappointing and I have decided that I will not try them again."
0,"Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \n\nOur dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \n\nBF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew."
0,"Well, we've been waiting since the end of April for the grand re-opening of the large dog park here - lots of excavating, drilling and new grass.  It reopened on July 5th.\nAnd now that the rains have come, the park is a muddier mess than ever before - mud and pools of water hidden beneath some thin grass.  Help!\n\nKona loved the ankle-deep muddy waters and he and several other dogs morphed into brown muddy pachiderms, while splashing around in this mess.  We all had to shampoo our dogs that morning.\n\nIs there nothing the park folks can do?  This is a basin and will always stay wet and muddy - the grass will soon be gone again.\n\nCan we start a fund raiser and get this park graded  properly and add  water station?\n\n/Craig(owner of Kona)"
1,"This is the best Thai food I have had from their eggplant dish to their pad thai noodle dishes to the soups and the many other dishes I have tried there. I always keep coming back not only for the food but the great service. \n\nThe pricing is pretty standard, $8-9 for a dish but they are large portions so definitely worth it.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of choice for dessert. They only have coconut ice cream (which is really good) and coconut custard. \n\nThe place is usually not crowded so you're immediately seated with no wait time (I've been there for both lunch and dinner). \n\nThe bathrooms are okay, they need a bit of updating but are clean. \n\nI gave it a 5 star mainly for the food and service, things like the dessert menu and the bathrooms can be easily \""remodeled\""."
0,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
1,"Ate here the first night my boyfriend and I got to Vegas. We were blown away by the decor of the restaurant, the quality of the food, the taste, and the price.\n\nI ordered the veggie pizza which might very well be the best veggie pizza I've ever had. The crust was soft yet crunchy on the bottom. The grilled veggies on top were amazing. All the flavors were amazing on the pizza. I think it was only $13. I had like 4 slices to take home after eating 4 in the restaurant. \n\nWe went back a second time and got mashed potato stuff eggrolls for appetizer. They were pretty good but they needed something more. Maybe the bacon since we ordered it without. I was craving asian food and got the zen noodles thinking it was a stir fry. Turned out to be a makeshift version of pho. Not good. A miss with that one. But I'm still stuck on the amazing pizza so I forgive them for the noodles. My bf ate a burger which he said was really good. \n\nThis place is also 24 hrs. Amazing ambiance, price, and food for Vegas! Watch out for crazy drunks at night."
0,"I happened to be in the University area recently around lunch time, so I quickly checked my Yelp App to see what dining options were nearby.  I found this place and decided to check it out.  When I pulled up in the parking lot, I had a bit of a dilemma as there was a Middle Eastern place right next door... but I decided to check out the Caribbean Hut since I have great Middle Eastern food in my neighborhood but no Caribbean/Jamaican places.  \n\nSo, I walked in and found that this place is one of those spots where you go up and place your order at the counter.  I quickly scanned the menu board and decided to go with jerk chicken. I asked and the girl behind the counter & she said it was served with beans & rice.  Ok - sounds good so far.  I wasn't sure about portion sizes, but I decided to go with the smaller portion size.  \n\nWhen my food came out, I was disappointed to see three little tiny pieces of chicken (which were mostly bone), rice  with only a couple of sparse beans mixed into the rice, and about half the plate was made up of some sort of slaw (WTH- she didn't tell me slaw came on the plate! I hate slaw, yuck!)  It did have 2 slices of plantains, which were tasty. \n\nWhen I dug into it, things didn't really get any better.  The jerk chicken was not very delicious - I was quite disappointed in both the subdued flavor and the terrible cut of \""meat\""...it was like 3 little chicken wings that hardly had any meat whatsoever on it.  Definitely not what I was expecting. \n\n I was expecting to dig  into a plate of wonderful calypso rice with  beans & a flavorful jerk chicken with plenty of spicy flavor. But this was just sad.  Based on the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the experience was so disappointing that I probably won't be back."
0,"Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!"
1,"I recently started working in this area and discovered Aj's! I had heard rave reviews from friends but I had never been to an Aj's myself. I am very impressed. I have been stopping by every couple of days to try out the salad bar and soup options. They also have an amazing selection of craft beers that I scoped out today. I have not shopped here yet for other grocery items but it looks like they have a great selection of healthy foods and harder to find local items. \n\nThe bakery is also very nice and has a good selection of bagels, pastries, brownies and cupcakes. I ordered a green chile bagel here the other day for lunch which was delicious. The berry acai tea is also wonderful. Really I have not found anything bad about this place so far. The service has also been great on every visit. Top notch. I will be back."
0,"Terrible. Terrible service, bland food, dirty seating area."
0,Well first the rooms are great and can't go wrong with the view on either side. I was a bit worried about the service aspect of this place based on a lot of below posts and they turned out to be true.\nHousekeeping is a complete disaster was there for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom suite and we only got fresh towels once. Called down numerous times the first 2 days and then we just went to the pool and stole some towels from there.\nThe projector TV didn't work called down numerous times about that....no one ever came up.\nOrdered room service for breakfast one mourning after 90 minutes we called down again and they didn't have our order.\nLong story short....\nRooms great\nView great\nLocation great\nService absolutely terrible.
1,"Phenomenal.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that I mentioned to someone (or maybe even on my review of The Counter or Brown Bag Grill, both in Los Angeles), that I wanted a similar custom built burger type restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt's here, folks!\n\nAlthough it is another american burger joint, they take it to the next level with their variety and quality.  I just came back from their 10:30PM-11:30PM half off special (which is pretty restrictive...details later), and I immediately took my computer out to write this review!\n\nThe restaurant itself is decently large.  It's located behind Uncle Sam's Subs in the Waterworks Mall (which is adjacent to TJ Maxx and Giant Eagle).  Because of their slightly obscure location, they do have a bright red sign that stands out from the other white colored signs.  There's an \""outdoor\"" dining area, with two large flames shooting upwards (almost the force of a butane torch, but with flames 3 feet tall) for appearance and a bit of utility.  The ambiance is slightly dark, the exact lighting that I expected (and the reason for my poor photography with my iPhone camera).  With 12 LCD screens , 9 at the bar alone, there's at least one TV where anyone in the restaurant can see.  Good space planning!\n\nBecause they appeared to close off half the tables after 10:30PM, we were told to take a seat at the bar.  The bartender came and greeted us, telling us that it's his first day, and also asking me where I heard of this place.  Where? Facebook.  I saw that a fellow Fox Chapel facebook friend of mine \""liked\"" this restaurant's page on facebook, and when I saw the menu online, i knew i had to visit it ASAP.\n\nThrough the facebook photo captions, I saw that they offer Happy Hour from 4-6PM, Monday-Friday.  This includes half off appetizers and some drink specials.  The other sweeter promotion they offer is for the first three months only, presumably starting from their opening date (1/19/11), and that is half off burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers from 10:30-11:30PM (closing). Half off excludes the following: custom burgers (boooo), any burger with bison, fish, or crab.. entrees (like steak) and steak salad.  The rest was up for discount. this took a while for them to figure out, and i was already filling out my custom burger sheet before they stopped me.\n\nThe first appetizer that caught my attention when i was surfing the menu online was their Bangkok Steak Fries, i.e. portobello mushroom fries.  The first and last time I tried it was at Bottega Louie in LA, and I've been dying to try them again - Burgatory gave me this chance.  It comes with a peanut sauce that was different from the chipotle aioli I tried it with the first time. The dish here took one large portobello mushroom, sliced it up, used tempura batter, and lightly fried it, allowing the flavor of the mushroom itself to stay around.  I highly recommend this appetizer.  We also got the nachos, and they were still pretty good, but slightly more forgettable than the portobello fries.\n\nOnto the entrees.\n\nI got a What-A-Jerk Chicken burger.  I didn't realize until the moment I bit into it that they use ground chicken for this burger, which I actually preferred over a standard chicken breast.  The burger was mindblowingly juicy, and had a lot of robust flavors, like the jamaican jerk rub on the chicken, the cilantro leaves which constituted all the greens on the burger (so much cilantro!), and banana ketchup.  although the ground chicken probably wasn't much healthier than the beef, it still tasted just as delicious. my friend had the Morty's Steakhouse, which again was a pretty strongly flavored burger (description from their site: \""Peppercorn Crusted Beef Burger with Horseradish Cheddar, Haystack Onions and Cabernet Sauce.\"")  Although i didn't take a bite of my friend's burger, my friend said on the car on our way back home: \""this may be the one thing that will make me not hate pittsburgh.\""\n\nThere are so many more things on the menu that I still look forward to trying, but didn't have the space to fit in my stomach.  Hard Shakes (yes, alcoholic shakes...what could be better!), 12 beers on tap, a bunch of other bottled varieties, classic shakes (if you call kona coffee and glazed donuts in a milkshake a classic shake), and most importantly, my own customized burger (with bison or crab)!\n\nI was almost hesitant to actually submit this review because it's been my best find in Pittsburgh so far.  I'm glad that I have a friend who has a car, so I can hitch a ride with him from shadyside/squirrel hill.  It's good that this place isn't too close to the colleges, which means that hopefully the crowd can be more manageable.  As long as they keep the quality up, I can guarantee that this place is here to stay.\n\nPS Sorry for the poor picture quality. The pictures don't do the food justice.  I promise to bring my actual camera next time! \n\nPPS I didn't know there was a 5000 character limit on reviews! This is the first time I've had to cut my review sh--"
1,Great ambience and good food. They have extensive wine list and  simple tasty menu. Great for big groups and have outside patio seating as well. Beef bourguinon was awesome but the fried pickles I can do without. We also ordered fried calamari and the dipping sauce was delish.
0,"Careful, everything you feared about dentists are true with this one. I have come in twice with these folks, and both experiences were not great.\n\nFirst time I went in, it was somewhat OK experience, the assistant was nice and friendly, but however I felt he was still training as he probably dosed me with enough radiation that I had to look up the effects from Chernobyl from so many x-rays due to mistakes.\n\nNext the cleaning was really quick, and they did not floss my teeth. Finally the dentist arrived. he was very friendly. took a quick view of my teeth and then moved on to a slide show to show me the problems. Obviously I felt like this was  a sales pitch to try and upgrade to super human teeth to chew through metal, or maybe it was a scare me straight tactic, either way I felt uncomfortable and a waste of my time as I don't know what I'm looking at or if that is normal at my age, so blah. \n\nAnyways I spent total of 5 minutes with him and hes gone, got my goodie bag and left. \n\nThe second time I fear was my complete undoing of the place. Different assistant, felt like she had waaaaaay less training as well  this time more painful. She really dug in, and hooked my gums, I clinched in pain and she asked what kind of pain it was, i said acute pain. She said that was a cavity, i know she was wrong cause it was on the side of my gum that she stabbed not my tooth, i can tell the difference in pain. She did this a few other times, I really wanted to just get up and leave at that point and finally the pain was over. \n\nFinally the dentist came in, same sales pitch less time may 3 minutes. On the way out the staff was somewhat rude after payment.\n\nFinal conclusion: This is the first time I am actually scared to go back to them. I will spend the extra money to go out of network to see any of my older dentists."
1,"This is one of my favorite places in downtown Chandler. Huge beer selection and they have a large menu of mixed beer drinks. The fish and chips are always a good choice and their cheese dip with pretzels is delish! I've had their wine burger as well and it was fantastic! We have always had great service that is prompt and friendly.\n\nMy only complaint is the smell. Another reviewer said \""mold maybe\""...no I would say urine. We have been there several times and sometimes you smell it and sometimes you don't. The last time we were there we were taken all the way to the back near the hallway to the bathroom and I asked to be moved due to the overwhelming odor. We moved more to the middle of the bar and although you could still smell it, it was less so, but I smelled it as soon as we walked in. It is an old building, but none of the other shops or restaurants have that odor. OWNERS: please have this fixed as I can see it driving people away."
1,"Really amazing food at Caesars Palace.  The tiger shrimp tamale were amazing.  I liked the complimentary bread selection.  Amazing!  Pork tenderloin sandwich was smokey and delicious.  Check out what else I ate by visiting my blog.\n\nhttp://www.dinedelish.com/2011/07/15/mesa-grill/\n\nThanks,\n\nDine Delish"
1,"Really gorgeous breakfast, everything looked good, but the pancakes were divine! Massive portions, but that's America! Taste was exceptional, one of the best places, for breakfast, I've ever eaten. The price was very good, about $40 for coffees and 2 lots of pancakes and that's including a generous, although normal, tip for America. Great atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Don't be put off by the queue; it moves quickly."
0,"Their frozen hot chocolate is, in my opinion, overrated. I came here with my family after dinner for their famous frozen hot chocolate but it was a bit disappointing and definitely overpriced. It pretty much tasted like a blended chocolate milk slushie. The wait was pretty long as well. At least I can say that I have finally tried their frozen hot chocolate but I would not get it again. A $10 drink that's barely enough for two? No thanks. Also, the staff was not that friendly as well."
0,Went the first time and it was gross!! The server had a attitude. The only reason for 2 stars was for the nice lady who dropped off the chips and salsa. Salsa was bland and tasted bad/old. The ground beef and shredded beef tacos were a light brown color... Never seen meat look that color. Taste was even worse than it looked bad and texture was huge chunks.. Beans and rice tasted like they were cooked in old fat and sitting for days. Do not waste any money in going here!!!
0,"Came here because we got $100 dining credit from our hotel. Upon entrance, place is really modern and reaallllyyy nice and upscale. So we also expected the food to be just as nice plus delicious.\n\nThe $100 was split among 4 ppl.... when we looked at the menu, it was only enough for about 3 entrees or 4 appetizers, and that is NOT enough for 4 people!! And the portion was very very small. The price is RIDICULOUS for what you get.\n\nWe ordered the yellowtail with scallion roll, salmon roll, kobe beef udon, chicken karaage, kobe beef fried rice, and salmon sashimi. The rolls were cut into 8 tiny pieces; taste was so so; price was $18 each. I had bigger and better rolls back home for half the price. The udon was delicious according to my friend, so I guess that's that. The fried rice was waaaay too salty, tender meat tho. The sashimi was ONE piece of fish the size of my small toe at $6. Seriously? After we finished our meals, we headed to Hooters for some 25-cent wings because we were still hungry after spending $180 here (they charged water and that's around $3 per person). I have to say I was more satisfied with the food at Hooters than here.\n\nConclusion: I'll never come here ever again. Total rip off, service was so so (they forgot my sashimi order, I had to ask for it), food was NOT worth the price."
1,Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.
1,"Since my previous review, Earthy have in fact been in touch to apologise for the slightly off-service I've experienced. I have to say this level of customer service and focus on feedback definitely warms me to them again. \n\nThe food has always been great, the only thing I was a bit put-off by was unfriendly service but since that has now been actively remedied I am once again a full-on Earthy fan. I haven't actually been back since they've been in touch, but I will update again for my return visit.\n\nOther cafes take note, this is how to keep customers coming back!"

Might as well show gas stations with A&Ws and other fast food chains in them. Nothing stands out here. Please don't make a special trip here, however I guess if you're getting gas and hungry, it's ok. Not worthy of broadcasting on TV for sure. In fact, makes me question the whole DD&D show."
0,"Took Expedition in for inspection.  Got the call that everything passed except for front ball joints.... Cost???  $645!!!  Ball joints from Autozone cost $34 each.  I asked the mechanic doing the inspection how far out of spec the joints were... He couldn't give me a spec... Only that in his opinion, it was too loose.  I told them I would get the work done myself, citing the cost of the ball joints, to which he replied, \""well, we're not the lowest cost on the block.\"". \n\nI got the joints replaced for 1/5 of the estimate from Firestone.... And 2 mechanics that I went to both indicated they would not have failed the inspection for those joints.\n\nSo here is the point... My experience with this shop might be out of the ordinary, but it is the experience you dread when taking your automobile in for a mandated inspection.  My advice is to get a second opinion when a shop like this springs something like this on you.  Unfortunately, most people just pay the price and go on.  If you are able to get a second opinion, I would encourage it.\n\nThe workers at this shop are friendly.  Like I said, I hope my experience was an anomaly... But I won't be back, even though the location is very convenient to where I live. \n\nBtw... The truck passed inspection when I took it back in."
1,I like the Grape.  It is a nice place to grab a glass of wine (or three) and some good appetizers or even dinner.  I agree with another reviewer who said it feels odd to have it in a mall.  That said the food and service are good.  The wine list is respectable and the staff helpful if you need some guidance on what wine to select.\n\nif you are in the mall shopping - pop in and indulge yourself.
0,"The planing and execution of this stores existence is superior. I love having this store in my neighborhood. However, the management and allocation of staff is horrible. I've been now over a dozen times and not once have i received anything but incompetent service. The deli host 4 young and inexperienced staff, doing about a third of the output it should. Same with the checkout counters. Slow, mistakes, and completely unkind. It is frustrating, having such a great store but managed so poorly."
0,I don't know if it is because my family and I went early or what but service shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a roll. Not only were we not greeted right away it took forever to get our sushi. The sushi rolls were okay but not worth the wait or the money especially since they were slow. Plus it sounded more like we were in a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. I am all for speaking a different language but not so loud you make your customers uncomfortable. All in all we will not be coming back.
1,"I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself"
0,Wow.....as bad as it gets.... And I've been traveling for 39 years. Terrible terrible terrible
1,I honestly have never gotten my nails done at Polished and not that I want to write a review about waxing- but all I can say is Hayley is fabulous-quick and professional. I have visited here for six years and will continue to. Tips in cash or check only.
0,"Overpriced, bland food. I've had a cheeseburger there three times and every one made me sick. The only good thing they have is the breakfast sandwich, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it."
1,"The Caley Sample Room is a gem in the western side of Edinburgh, with a loyal local following and plenty of folk who travel a way to get here. The food wins awards, the beers and drinks are varied and plentiful and it has the best table water in Edinburgh (stuffed with mint, cucumber and whatever else they think will help).\n\nThe architecture's a little odd, but that probably stems from its previous life as part of the nearby brewery. The exterior can seem a little uninviting and unfortunately it lends itself to smokers clogging up the doorway, but the pub opens up once you're in. The restaurant to the right has plenty of covers, set around heavy wooden tables that bring a feeling of tradition and quality. To your right is the rest of the pub, with a long bar that stretches into the distance. Good for a quiet midweek pint, or a busy Friday night, they host regular live music nights and other special events.\n\nThe staff know they're stuff about the menu and the drinks on offer, which is all you can ask. Fortunately I've always found them friendly too.\n\nIt's well worth your while calling in to the CSR if you're in the area - near Fountainbridge, the canal, Gorgie Farm and the other delights of this side of town."
0,"This review is mainly in regards to their Fantasy Football Draft promo.\n\nLast year ('08 season) one of my fantasy football leagues saw an ad for hosting your draft party here, so we thought we would give it a try. It was pretty cool...we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us. We also got a great draft kit that included a board (we were able to hang it up on the wall) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see. We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill. We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in '09.\n\nSo, this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation. The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone. I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date (same guy, very accommodating). On the day of our draft, very different story. I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us. I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at. This would not do, especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board. I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager. I waited, and waited, and still no manager, so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down. Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us. I explained to her that we wanted to sit here, that we had been here last year (same time at night) and it was an ideal setup, and that one of our players wasn't even 21 and able to sit in the bar. She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually, but not without threatening us with the police!! Oh, yeah, we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20, and she's telling us that there is a curfew on the strip (mind you, we are no where near the resort corridor) and if the police come in, its not her problem. Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving...we said \""fine\"" and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks. In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food. No discount either. One other thing, another fantasy football team was there that same night and didn't seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either...they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.\n\nSo...I am also in another fantasy league. For the last four years, this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe. This year, based on my experience from '08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW. After the experience with my first draft of '09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available. Of course, the manage (the guy) didn't have our reservation. What!! We made it three weeks prior!! good thing I called. Again, I got there early (eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition). We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time! woo hoo! Lots more drinking and food this time! Just as everyone shows up the manager (a manager, not the lady from the previous draft) informed us that they had no more draft kits! Really!! Are you kidding me!! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits!!! I was so embarrassed and pissed off. I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year. I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties?? BOO WILD WINGS!!!\n\nP.S. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo....your wings are NOT real buffalo wings!!!\n\nP.P.S One star for the potato wedges with cheese and the really nice, attentive server we had the second draft of '09."
1,The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome.
0,"I know all fast food workers don't use gloves, but this confuses me. I was sitting in the drive thru (my daughter wanted a shake I hate this location) and I'm watching a young man peel a banana with his hands the break it into pieces with his hands, put it into a cup, the wipe his hands off onto his black apron. Kinda gross. Is his apron clean??"
1,The styling of this Hotel/Casino is very nice.  It's convenient having this one on the north end of town.  The buffet is great for selection if you are on this end and want to avoid the Strip.  \n\nIt's one-stop shopping for food/entertainment-- we will hit one of the restaurants then movie theater for family date night.  :)\n\nThe convention center here is also very nice; smaller scale than some of the other casino/hotels in Vegas but it gives it a more personal feeling; a little friendlier.
0,ruined a very expensive dress and when  had to reimburse me for it...pushed back. This was in in DC Ranch. DO NOT USE IN MY OPINION.
0,"As a lover of all Asian food I was so looking forward to a great meal. I am yet to be disappointed by any Groupon that I bought, but boy was I not expecting such a disappointment\n\nFirst off, I'll give SMPP props for the nice decor (hence the 1 star) but thats about all i have positive to say\n\nThe hostess had no idea if it was still lunch hour and neither did the server (isn't that their job?). \n\nThe waitress openly admitted she had not tried most of the food and had trouble recommending any dishes (note to servers...lie to your patrons that you think something is good and make a recommendation!) Not sure if she was new but she was terrible. \n\nOnto the food....\n-the potstickers where nothing to write home about...you only get 4 and for the price it was not worth it\n-the mongolian beef tasted like donkey...I hate to say it but Panda Express is a 5 star restaurant compared to this shit\n-the peking pub burger was ok...but really if a burger is the best thing you can make at a chinese restaurant ...convert yourself to a burger joint\n-the best part to me was hearing a microwave beep and seeing the serving go grab our brown rice out of it! I could tell it was right from trader joes.\n\nBottom line, what a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND CALORIES!"
0,"It might be a bit early to rate this joint as it's still fairly new... BUT, because it's new, I can't say that I had a great first impression.  \n\nThumbs up to the atmosphere and decor - it was refreshing to see a bar in Vegas that didn't look like a typical bar in Vegas.  I enjoyed the live music - definitely a nice touch.. took a peek at the lounge but didn't find it too inviting... \n\nAs for the food, the appetizer selection was great.. the entrees?  Not so much.  Had one of the \""TV\"" dinners.  Wasn't expecting much so I would say I was indifferent overall.\n\nOur server wasn't exactly friendly and didn't appear to know too much about the menu or what beers they had in stock (ordered 3 different beers and they were out).  Growing pains I'm sure... but I think I'll give it a couple months before I give it another go."
1,"My first time ever visiting a Cracker Barrel Restaurant! We came from Los Angeles to visit with my brother, and HOLY SMOKES! This place rocks! Why don't we have these in LA?!\n\nIt was too hot to cook, so we needed to find a restaurant. I was a little hesitant to try them, because I live off of Yelp reviews, and the ones for this locations are not so good. But one of the girls travelling with us desperately wanted to go here, so we gave in.\n\nBeing the weirdoes we are, we all decided to go to the restaurant wearing ridiculous hats and speak in different accents. We had a train conductor who said \""choo choo\"" after every sentence, an Australian explorer, a Russian spy, a hillbilly, and a Texas cowgirl. We were seated right away with no judgments, which already was amazing, as I'd judged myself. haha!\n\nThe waiter LARRY was super nice; took our drink orders, and didn't question our strange appearances or bad accents. When asked where I was from, I panicked and confessed that we were just dorks having a fun family outing... He loved it, barked a laugh, admitted he thought the \""choo choo\"" girl was kind of strange, and went on to have a great conversation with us. Turns out Larry is fricken awesome. :)\n\nThe food was OMG good! I had the chicken fried chicken with macaroni and cheese, apples, and mashed potatoes. Seriously delicious! It was a huge serving, so I took over half of it home with me, and cost less then $10! My daughter got the sampler plate with meatloaf, ham, and chicken & dumplings.... all 3 were delicious! Definitely not something you'd want to eat when counting calories, but we were on vacation, so it's ok. :p\n\nThe ambiance is super cute. Old antiques gave it the country vibe, tables were clean, and there were little games on the table you can play while you wait for dinner! There was a country store at the entrance selling all sorts of knick knacks, tshirts, old fashioned candies, etc. We didn't buy anything, but had fun exploring the store and seeing all they had to offer!"
1,"Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over. \n\nPool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?\n\nThe only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue. \n\nDefinitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas."
1,"I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!"
1,"Unlike the previous review, I've ate here. 4-5 times, and each time I've had EXCELLENT food and service. Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place."
0,"I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this."
0,"I came the week before Thanksgiving, which generally feels like a off-season time, so many things were much quieter and less crowded overall in Vegas.\n\nPros:\nMy room was dead quiet. I never heard a peep from any other people my entire stay, let alone really saw any other people.\n\nThe location was perfect - I prefer off the strip.\n\nGreat decor. I picked this hotel for that reason - something different. Cozy, no gambling, or shows, or late night bars, just quiet. Ahhh... :)\n\nFree parking, free wifi....I think (noticed a funny charge for $100 this morning...)\n\nCons:\nThe CHILDREN in charge of checking people in need a lesson in manners and customer service. Extremely unhelpful.  I booked through Priceline and paid the room in full MONTHS ahead. Even called days before to confirm my reservation.  I get there after a 5hr drive and they say I need to pay $75/per night for \""incidentals\"".  I've NEVER been charged a fee that huge at a hotel. I didn't have an extra $150 as my paycheck didn't go through until midnight. They said they couldn't help me. I was able to convince them to charge me just $75 for the first night and that I would settle the second $75 in the morning - no f&*ing way was I going to sleep in my car till midnight when I had already paid for my room.  That's just BAD BUSINESS.\n\nStay somewhere else. The business ethics of this place are shady and the staff are bored apathetic teens."
0,"I hate to give this place a 2 star review based on some things that are not their fault but the truth of the matter is that I have had better accommodations elsewhere and at other Hamptons.  \n\nI picked this Hampton because it was close to where I needed to be, not too far from the strip/food and it was close to the airport...that last one is what got me.  It's VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY close to the airport.  I mean very close.  Like, look out your window and there's a jumbo jet close.  \n\nSo the planes landing and taking off at all hours of the night?  You can hear all of it.  It gets so bad that the windows shake at times and if you're a light sleeper then you probably aren't sleeping.  They provide you with ear plugs but...how will I hear my alarm with those ear plugs in?\n\nAnyhow, the staff is really nice and the breakfast isn't bad at all.  But the problem comes from location and it's proximity to the runway.  If you like watching and hearing airplanes take off at all hours of the night, this is the place for you.  For me?  Not so much."
0,place is very clean:) Banana Republic is the only store I really go to here.
0,"Unfortunately, all of the reviews below are accurate.  I just rented a car last night at Thrifty and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get through the line to the one person working at the counter.  All of the other car rental places, with the exception of Dollar (right next door), had no lines or minimal lines that were moving quickly.  There is something seriously wrong from a management perspective if you expect people to wait in line that long (longer than the actual plane ride) to get a car.  Many people left the line or went over to other car rental companies to pay more for a car just to avoid the line.  I travel to Vegas frequently and consistently have seen lines of this magnitude with Thrifty.  Unfortunately, the price of the rental car lured me in this time. Never again. I will gladly pay more for a car from another company. The line and lack of adequate service made me miss my dinner reservation with friends. \n\nI highly recommend that someone from Thrifty Corporate visit this location to whip management into shape and create a much better flow system to be respectful to customers.  Until then, I recommend that you look elsewhere to rent."
1,"Yes!  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness... but it's twice as awesome!  You get what you pay for at Lifetime.  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break, I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym.  It's the little things; you don't need to bring a towel, soap, a locker key or lunch!  The caf\u00e9 has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu.   As a vegetarian, there are several options for me to choose from.   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years, I honestly could never switch gyms, call me a snob ... I don't care!"
1,"Clancy's might finally be the marquee to stick around this location.  My signage memory only goes as far back as Sunday's, and the one time I went in, I was probably the youngest person in there by 25 years- I wasn't their target demo.\n\nOne-Eyed Dog?  It's fine... but every single time I walked in there, weekday or weekend, there was Karaoke.  I'm all for hatcheting up a song, as I do a fairly awful version of \""Centerfold\"" myself, but I don't want to sing it seven nights a week, and you can only hear \""Goodbye Earl\"" done badly so many times.\n\nClancy's?  It's simple.  It's an Irish pub.  Food is a small notch above typical bar food, and the Nachos were surprisingly effective.  The pizza was reasonable, nothing special.  The burgers- I'm a fan.  Beer selection is decent, staff is more friendly than just about any in Scottsdale.  My friend took issue with his treatment by the ownership the last time there, but that's his cross to bear.  I guess they don't take kindly to Canadian Hockey fans during the Olympics threatening to commandeer the microphone to sing their national anthem.  Now THAT would have been some singing I'd have loved to hear.\n\nIt's a simple Irish Pub with simple bar food.  If you don't feel like an Old Town club but do feel like a drink, you can pull in, park, eat, drink, be treated well at the bar, converse, leave, and do so without any pain, then this is a solid place to do so.  In this area, sometimes simple is better."
1,Every time I've been here I've had excellent service.\n\nMy selection: Chicken and Waffles and a Sangria.
1,"Good portions at a reasonable price. I honestly think you can buy one entree and split with a friend/spouse and have enough food for the both of you. I can eat quite a bit and still have enough food for lunch the following day.\n\nThe gyro platter was very good. The meat was well cooked and seasoned. The platter also consists of a nice portion of vegtables (carrots, squash, carrots), potatos and rice. You also get a few pieces of pita.\n\nThe hummus platter as an appetizer is excellent. There are 3 different types of hummus (regular, sun dried tomato and another kind that I can't recall). I wish they would provide more pita bread with the appetizer though.\n\nYou can choose to sit inside or choose covered outside seatiing. \n\nThere is also a full bar for drinks.\n\nService was pretty good."
0,Ambience great. Coffee ok. Service below par. That's me in there now 3 times this past week and not a smile or hello from anyone working there. One more try and then I'm moving on if no change...
1,"My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend."
0,"This was the most awful teppanyaki place I've ever been to!  Not only was it dead empty, which made for an awkward situation every time someone spoke, but the food was horrible!  \n\nThe salmon tasted very fishy and definitely not worth $32!  The portion of steak was tiny and dried out. Even the terriyaki sauce was bad...  How do you screw up terriyaki??  Fried rice had no taste either...\n\nWill never return. I definitely recommend against this place!!"
1,So.good. I love Wynn and encore restaurants because they all have vegan menus! I went with two other girls and we all loved it! We got a carafe of the sale and it was delish! Lychee in each glass.we started with the gardein shu Mai and could have eaten that all nite and been very happy. I got the sweet and sour gardein and it was fantastic- the sauce was incredible and there was so much! I also got The shiitake nagi and was a little bummed... Not enough eel sauce!
1,"Inner Vision has yoga classes for all levels and all moods--getting a good workout, moving some muscles before meditating, or stretching, relaxing and leaving stress behind. Not a mediocre teacher in the bunch--they are all wonderful! Monday night in Chandler Yin/Relax with Patricia makes the rest of my week go a lot smoother."
0,Let me start by saying I normally dont wear a lot of make up...with full time school an work and family im lucky to show up dressed...so the world of make up artists was very new to me but I wanted to really look pretty on my wedding day because he is the man of my dreams and i wanted to make him proud. I contacted Megan and she was wonderful very kind and understanding...I told her I had a budget and if this cant work then ill just do my make up myself...she worked with me which i was shocked and thankful...That was the best part of the make up experience...No one had informed me that it was important to find a look id want in advance which i wouldnt have known what to have picked anyway...so when the woman arrived she sat up and said what would you like ..i said just make me beautiful...the make up was cakey the eyeshadowed aged me by 20yrs and the lashes would not stay on...really wanted to cry but due to contacting the girl about the lashes which she got frustrated with me on I was late to my own wedding..bottum line you can tell if a person loves your work even if they say oh thats fine..she was my only damper on my wedding day..when i was asked to leave a review on another web site i tried to be nice but was contacted by the company via text chewing me out for giving a 2.9..i said Sephora redid my make up correctly and that the 2.9 was me being nice now leave me alone...Not professional at all...
0,People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.
0,"The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."
1,Wow breakfast was fabulous. Eggs were perfectly cooked and love that sausage. But my favorite was the pancakes  so tender and tasty. They also serve a special AZ coffee that is smooth and the refills keep coming !  We must put this on our permanent list for breakfast !
1,"I was looking forward too checking out Commonwealth since I missed awesome CMYE for it earlier. We finished our DTLV night after Park on Fremont here with fellow yelpers plus meet up with more yelpers in toasting Noah R birthday. My first impression was wow its really nice and man think under dressed for it. It definitely more of upscale bar or without doubt out of the all the bars clustered together downtown this one by far most upscale and classy arts look too it. The artwork on the walls most of them huge paintings of have no idea or the cool chandeliers. It kind of dark got me thinking at the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland. The artwork feel like person staring right into your eyes so waiting for the eyes too move or something. Lol! Just the details too the interior is pretty darn cool!! The upstairs patio area sure something unique too downtown and on perfect weather day (that night it was) nothing better in life. The view looking down see the vibe going on that night, break out few dance moves with the music going on, and see El Cortez Hotel all the history of that Hotel too downtown. Patio for sure cool spot too chill out hanging out with friends drinking enjoying life. When the place is packed it totally like club because we walked around too check it out and push my way through get from one end too another. Almost missed they have this cool game or people playing so never figured it out. You throw some object attached too string at target and that about all I got. Sure next time I visit going too figure it out.\n\nThe prices it not that bad still pricey but cheaper then going too club or drinking on the strip for the most part?  This coming from someone like me going clubbing few and far between so take it for what it worth. Lol! I really like the vibe of the place and between the patio and inside lot of different places can hang out get your drink on at Commonwealth. Another great addition too awesome downtown scene of little bars, food spots, and lot of fun!"
0,"Let me explain why this place deserves no more than 3 stars:\n\nThey shout customer orders over a loud speaker like you are getting a wake-up call via the 1MC on a US Navy ship.  No, that is not a good thing!  Plus, it is crowded, packed, and very loud.\n\nPeople seem to come here for the cheap food ($5-6 per order), but you get what you pay for.  Carolina's West personnel throw bland food in a styrofoam carton and expect you to be content with some various combinations of lettuce, beans, cheese, and tortillas.  The taste is totally bland.\n\nAbuelos, which is just a couple miles to the north, is a much better option for Mexican food.  Don't say that I didn't warn you!!!"
0,"satan himself could not have dreamed of a more dreadful dead end shit hole as this. Nor would satan have made a worse taco. how is it possible to screw up a taco? its a tortilla with meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce of some sort. however, dos gringos managed to screw up at its most basic level. i couldn't eat those poor excuses of tacos. anyone claiming that they're ok should be in an institution or better yet, fed to an animal.\n\nas far as people that lurk around this place, those poor bastards look like rejects from the worst of the worst from the college gene pools. the most unattractive group i've seen in ages.\n\nby all means, stay away from this place unless you love eating terrible food and like hanging out with less than stellar people."
1,"Food was delicious! Ambiance top notch. Fun, classy decor to look at everywhere you turn. Our server was super attentive and ready with menu suggestions and recommendations. We will absolutely be back and bring our friends! :)"
1,"We had a large group dinner here for work. The staff was super nice and very attentive. We had a set menu/price arrangement to make it easier to serve our group. The selections were not disappointing.\n\nThe shrimp and crab cake appetizer were excellent. The shrimp has a spicy punch and the vegetables underneath were untouched... I grabbed them and they were awesome! Crab cakes were meaty and flavorful. \n\nI had a petite fillet, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. It was a great steak. The brined and roasted chicken was also tasty, but you have to like the saltiness of a brined meat. I recommend a bland side item to take up some of the salt.\n\nThe sides of sugar snap peas and loaded mashers were both very good.\n\nFinally, the creme brulee was for REAL. Real vanilla beans, perfect caramel sugar crust, perfect texture and taste of the custard. Really good eats. \n\nThey also had a decent wine list... never a bad thing!"

0,"I would never recommend living in this apartment place. I've lived in several wonderful apartments throughout downtown Phoenix and Tempe, but never have I experienced such a terrible living situation as I have at Mill Pointe Aparments. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. constant crime area: gunshots, homeless walk freely through the property grounds, strangers/possible harmful individuals knocking on your door pretending to be servicemen, police constantly driving through but never actually doing anything, etc. when coming home at night time, ive noticed plenty of clearly ODD people sneaking around the parking lot, looking through cars. in one instance i saw a man that lived in an apartment at mill pointe chasing after a man with a mask, claiming he was looking through the windows of his home watching his family.\n\n2. mgmt company: every time i have called them for a work order, or alterations to my lease, or any kind of question, the manager of the complex is ALWAYS \""out in a meeting\"" and/or unavailable. no matter when i call, morning noon or evening. after becoming upset about this recurring problem, i called and once again they told me jennifer the manager was in a meeting, so i walked down to the offices, and there was jennifer in her office, alone with the door shut. (i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours.\n\n3. the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in. flies and gnats everywhere. my neighbor had told me upon her moving in, her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches. the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure, such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet.\n\n4. work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice. i, nor did most of my connecting neighbors, have hot water for over 48 hours, MULTIPLE TIMES.\nI called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door. he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock. i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle, he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether, rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportant.\n\nAll other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above. \nSTAY AWAY."
0,The only reason I gave this two stars was for the pleasant wait staff and hostess greeting.  Bread came out boiling hit and mushy like it had been microwaved or steamed.  Spread for bread tasted odd.   Ordered a grilled chicken salad.  Chicken might have once been grilled but it was ice cold and therefore tasteless.  The bread on the steak sandwich was again mushy and tough like it had been microwaved.   Awful.  The waitress asked if we would like to see the.manager.  Manager never came so we left without eating.  The waitress was sympathetic.   Now we know why this huge restaurant was empty on a Saturday night.  Only two other tables occupied.  This place was once a very nice restaurant.   What happened?  I see others share our concerns on yelp
0,"Brought my knives on a Sunday. \""I can't sharpen knives,\"" said the clerk. \""I've only been working here a few weeks.\"" Why, then, is the knife sharpening store open if you can't sharpen knives? Sure, you sell some other things, but that's not why I was there."
0,"Date 12-4-1010\n\n\nIn the past year I have eaten in your Peoria store not less than 30 times. We use this place to meet with our friends and children. We can come in get something to eat and chat. \n\nTonight my wife and I went there to eat. She ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and I ordered the same in a bread bowl. The bread bowls just have a small divot in the top for the soup. This divot is much to small for a cup of soup and it spills into the plate. I asked if enough bread could be removes to hold the soup without it spilling onto the plate. Nothing was said. When my order was delivered to the table the person proceeded to tell me that if I wanted it that way in the future they would have to charge me for a bowl of soup instead of a cup. \n\nI never asked for any special consideration on the price when I ordered the soup. Would not that of not been the time to tell me that it would cost more to fix the soup the way I wanted ?? The person that delivered the soup then proceeded to lecture me on the fact that I had gotten more than I had paid for. I asked her to please leave. I had to do this twice as she continued to try and lecture. \n\nI did not get her name. She was about 5'8\"" slim light brown hair. Probably 20 or less. I should of called for the manager but at that time I was so mad I just ate my soup and left. \n\nI have been eating out for many years. This is the worst service I have ever had. Maybe you think one out of 30 times in the restaurant is acceptable for bad service. I don't!!\n\nI did write a letter to the Corporate Office.  Lets see if they care?"
0,"I know that sometimes, the ratings on these kind of sites are low and people exaggerate. But Arcadia Del Sol fully deserves its one star rating. \n1. The water is always off. ALWAYS. It is either fully turned off or the hot water is off. It happens several times a month. They never actually fix the problem, they just band-aid it up and wait for it to happen again. For all of the money that Allison-Shelton makes off of this place, they don't put very much back into it.\n2. Which brings me to my second point. They just put a TON of money into painting to attract new residents instead of taking care of their current residents and fixing the existing problems (such as the water, a/c, etc.)\n3. They are SHADY!!!! I lived in an apartment where the a/c did not work (they finally admitted it after about a year of me complaining and they told me it was all in my head basically). They said the whole column of apartments did not work, and that they were not moving anyone into any of them. We switched apartments and literally a month later they moved someone into our apartment.\n4. They advertise a lot of features that are pretty much non-existent. They advertise 2 pools (always green and uncleaned), a gym (that was taken out years ago), a courtyard (that is covered in dog poop), and a lobby room for events (that they are currently using as storage).\n5. Everything around here is SO old and falling apart. The countertops are some old material from the 70s that if you get a drop of ANYTHING with color on it, it will be permanently stained (that's not an exaggeration). My faucets leak, my carpets are stained, the closet doors don't function (ie they sit there, they dont really open), etc.\n6. Lastly, the marijuana. They say they serve the drug users in the community with papers for fines and asking them to stop, etc. and the residents deny they use marijuana.... why not just evict them? Because the apartment complex only cares about the money.\n\nThis apartment complex has so much potential but unfortunately, the management is awful and I am so thrilled to be moving at the end of my lease."
1,"This is the heart of Las Vegas...flashing neon lights, hotels, shopping, restaurants, the gorgeous Bellagio Fountain, women/men passing out porn fliers, and everything else imaginable can be seen on the strip. Let me warn you, it is a b**ch trying to get from one end of the strip to the other due to traffic."
0,"The worst dining experience I have had in years.  If I were not with 5 friends, though they were agonizing over the service, I think I would have gone nuts.  The pri fixe dinner portions were tiny, then they refused to serve dessert, and would not give us any break in the price.  Service was almost non existent, extremely slow.  You won't find me ever going back."
1,"Yes the bill was $120K. Yes the place is very well designed. Yes they play classical music in the main lobby (played by an actual pianist). Most of all yes they took fantastic care of my mother in her time of need.\n\nI flew to Phoenix to help my father because my mother suffered a major stroke. Luckily she was just down the road from Mayo and received the care she needed. Not only did she live, but they also found other problems that may have played a role in the stroke. Overall I am very thankful to them for their care and ensuring that my mother had her needs met while admitted as a patient.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Plenty of parking for people to visit. Easy to find off the main highway (you want to take the 56th Street exit). Parking is free. Just don't park in labeled spots, you will get booted. \n\n2.  Top notch facility that bases their medical care upon current research. It's not just let's try this and that and see what happens, rather carefully planned treatment. Their neurosurgeon suggested a surgery for my mother (hemicraniectomy) as an option if her brain kept swelling but explained what it truly would do for her. She knew we had a right to know but definitely didn't seem to support the procedure. We decided against it because my mother was lucid during the conversation and was also against it. The surgeon also showed us the CT of my mother's brain and explained everything in simple terms for my father to understand what was happening. In general, I considered this the most important part of dealing with a crisis situation.\n\n3.  Never thought I would say this but their lunch room is top notch. Great selection of food, labeled with nutritional information, and definitely tasty. Also, not break the bank prices. If I lived/worked in the area I would stop by here just for the lunch, that's how good it was to me. A very nice room to sit in with plenty of large windows and an outside eating area.\n\n4.  Caring staff that was attentive to our needs. When I needed to talk to the social worker about the next steps they were very informative and friendly to us. They knew where to send my mother and made sure her belongings got there.\n\n5.  They sent an itemized bill to my father so he would know the breakdown of everything done for my mother. For those of you that don't think insurance is important, a $120K bill will change your outlook.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  None, I definitely approve of this place. Your health plan might be the issue for long-term care but I would definitely want to go here for my immediate and long term care."
0,"I didn't have a good experience at this restaurant. First, I think the name \""gastropub\"" is thrown around a little loosely these days. I noted a few items hinting at creativity, but mainly the menu is bar appetizers, burgers and some British food. Creed and Maroon 5 on the sound system, and enough \""flair\"" on the wall to make you feel like you are in a British TGI Fridays, not a hole in the wall British Pub. \n\nWent for lunch and the place was not packed at all. Despite seeing several servers walking around, waited a good 10 minutes for a water and a menu. The following was ordered: buffalo burger medium, substitue horseradish sauce instead of bleu cheese, and sweet potato fries. 35 minutes later (place is almost empty) food arrives by a different server who puts it down without saying anything and walks away. Food consists of a small patty of well done meat on a very large, somewhat burned bun. I am not sure of there burger weight, but putting it on a bun twice the size does not help with any sort of illusion. Large hunk of bleu cheese, but no horseradish anywhere to be found. No one is around and I am starving so I scrape off the cheese and just eat it. Anyone who has had buffalo understands it has a different flavor than beef. I cannot verify this, but I am pretty sure I DIDNT have a buffalo burger. \n\nNo one checked on me even if I had wanted to say anything. The next time I saw my server he was delivering my unasked for check. \n\nThis \""pub\"" is exactly the reason I avoid chain restaurants whenever I can. \n\nSince I want to be a little nice, if you do want a good beer selection (and even some ciders) this place might be up your alley. Also, the sweet potato fries were good."
0,My co-workers and I came here for lunch. We ordered the chicken nachos and found two long hairs in them. It was totally gross. Other than that the food is ok.
1,"I cannot say enough great things about Copyfast!  When it comes to award winning service and product production - they are at the top of my list.  It is nice to know that family-oriented, specialized copy centers still exist!  I had the opportunity to meet the owners one day, although at that time - I did not know that they owned Copy Fast.  After a brief chat with them - I can see why their copy center is the best in town.  I knew I loved this place before, but now after meeting them and hearing about the passion they have for their store, their customers and their employees - I am even more thrilled that I have this place to go to for all my copy needs!"
0,I had the Mackerel and Spicy tuna with a couple of beers and it chimed in for ~$100. Not a good experience from a service standpoint either. The sushi was mediocre at best. \n\nDon't waste your $$$.
1,Mori helped save me $$ by fabricating a new clip for my back power window. If I bought a new part it would have cost a couple Benjamin's. He rewired the old piece. I also asked him questions about what would be the best suv to buy next. Usually car guys don't like to answer questions but he was very helpful.  They even washed my car for me!! Will be back for more car service & advice. Thank you so much!
0,I was visiting for the weekend and we were looking for somewhere to go watch the LSU versus Alabama game and we chose Lot 17. When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.
0,"Never will I return here.   Eh food and rude management!! Willing to lose a customer over $2 well he succeeded!!! Internet here sucks so I checked in on four square 2 min after I paid when I sat down.    I went up to the manager with my receipt and showed him the four square check in special which is $2 off a $5 order , we spent almost double that.  He refused to honor it because the transaction was done.  It was done 2 min ago!!! I won't be back and I told him that.  It's not that he couldn't do anything it's that he didn't want to.  Horrible management and customer service here.   My first and last time here.   They lost me as a customer."
1,"Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)"
1,"What a difference a couple months can make. We had put this restaurant on the \""No Way\"" list after a couple consecutive bad meals and slow service early this year. Had almost gotten used to almost no cars there until today and WOW, the parking lot was full so we decided to try lunch and sure glad we did. We loved the one in Chandler and after it closed we even went all the way to Scottsdale looking for Greek Now we have OUR Big Fat Greek just up on Southern again. All cleaned up, attentive waiters, and fresh, fresh, fresh food! Lunch menu isn't huge like some places but the servings are large, the salads crisp and the meats tender and flavored just the way we like them. Our friends from Utah will be glad to hear we have a really good Greek place back again."
0,"I would have given it four stars when I first came here several years ago but several years later I can't give it four stars.  We came here for lunch which was $23 and while $23 isn't expensive for buffet at the Wynn, the restaurant lacked variety, creativity, and change.  After eating at Wicked Spoon which charges $27 for dinner one would think the Wynn would offer something spectacular.  The display of the food was boring, the variety was non existent and the taste of the food wasn't very good.  For example the pad thai didn't taste like a pad thai, the turkey was way too dry, the clam chowder looked like goo, and the only thing that was half way decent was the ice cream.  \n\nThis buffet was once the best buffet on the strip but it got complacent.  It's like an athlete who made it to the big leagues and then decided he or she didn't need to work out, train, or just get better.  I don't know if the dinner would be better but lunch wise it was kind of like buffets in Reno."
0,"Long story short: really terrible coffee.\n\nHumble Lion's espresso is undrinkable. It is extremely bitter, acidic, and thin (almost no crema). It's so bad you can smell how sour it is before even putting it to your lips. A shameful amount of sugar was needed to make mine palatable. I don't know what the problem is, but I hope the owners read this and take note. It's also expensive at $3 a cup, but to be fair the amount served is more like a double than a ristretto.\n\nThe cafe has an otherwise pleasant ambiance but the music is played at bar volumes, which makes working, reading, and even having a conversation more difficult."
0,"I had a groupon sat down to order looked at how dirty the menus are, the owner watching a big OLD tv in the dinning room, Nobody in the place, looked kinda like they didnt have the money to maintain the place...Told my wife and Kids LETS GO!!!! If the dinning area looks this bad I can only guess what the kitchen looks like. NO THXs sorry but if you want customers you need to work on your place and put the Guy with the TV in the back out of site......\nP.S the food might be good, I just ran for my life before i tried it..."
1,"This place is by far THEE best place I have ever been to. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing, the service was friendly and professional, AND my nails turned out PERFECT. Thanks to Lily my feet were cared for more than they have ever been before during my pedi. I had a picture of what I wanted my nails to look like and Lily went above and beyond what I wanted for my mani. The receptionist was also super nice and helped me pick out perfect colors. There was so much time and care spent on me it was an absolutely perfect experience. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'd give more stars if I could."
0,The quality of the food on the happy hour menu has gone down. Ordered the calamari and it came out stale and mostly all batter.
0,"Super rip off. Took the car in for an oil change. They recommended $2000+ of \""repairs\"". I left and took it to a mechanic who I trust. All it needed was $230 for brake pads (Firestone wanted $450 for that). Stay away from this place unless you have money you don't want."
0,"Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???"
1,"A \""5\"" for the Dosa, Lassi's, and the service!  On a separate occasion we took in-laws (from India) for the lunch buffet; they said it was the best they've had in a long time.  I would love to see them offer a Chinese Dosa or Genie Dosa!"
1,Really people it's in n out burger do I really have to say anymore except. Fresh and yummy.
1,"The Platinum is a very nice hotel.  You don't pay top prices, and you get almost-luxury.\n\nEvery room - even the smallest - are very large suites, all with balconies and full kitchens.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I didn't use much of the kitchen or living room so I can't comment there, but the bed was super comfy.  The gigantic jacuzzi tub was awesome, as were the two sinks, and the two tvs (though I only used the one in the bedroom).  \n\nThere were a few less-than-luxury elements I noticed, such as there being no bedsheet and the comforter being put on backwards, one of the water handles on the tub leaking, a complicated and ultimately non-working alarm clock, and a lack of hot-enough water in the shower two of my three mornings (though certainly nowhere near cold).  But, it was a really nice stay for the price.  The wifi worked great.\n\nThe staff is very nice and let you alone, and the valet attendants are extremely friendly, quick, and helpful.  The pool area seemed nice, though it was late December  so aside from checking it out I didn't visit it (though I probably would have for the jacuzzi had I not had the jetted tub of my own).\n\nThe hotel was quiet and the room service menu looked great, though I didn't try it.  The fitness center is what you'd expect - a hardwood floor room with three large TVs, 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and weights and benches.  My only complaint is that there was heat blasting straight on you every 10 minutes.  Not awesome, but whatever.  \n\nThe Platinum is a great choice if you want a nice place that ISN'T on the strip, but is easily within walking distance."
0,"I am so frustrated with Vegas Cellular right now !  I called to ask how much it would be to replace the cracked glass on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and they said it was $80.  I asked him if he could do any better and he said just come in and talk to me.  I explained that I am coming from Henderson and if I was going to come in I needed to know the best price over the phone.  He agreed on $70, so I packed up my two young kids and we drove across town to get my phone fixed.  I go in, verify that I am talking to the same guy as on the phone (I think he is the owner....name is Mansoor) and we begin talking details.  He prints out the agreement and it says $120!  I told him we agreed on $70 and he started to tell me that I had told him I had an S3 on the phone when we spoke and not an S4.  Um, NO!  I did not say I had an S3....and why does that even matter....a $50 difference!?  He stated the best he could do was $100.  If I wanted to pay $100 I would just do it through my phone's insurance plan.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They are not trustworthy."
1,"My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey, but it was well worth it for the atmosphere and experience.  We loved the Hacienda feel of the property and enjoyed the time at the pool.  No rowdy kids were to be seen and everyone was enjoying the sun and quiet.  The whole evening was quiet.\n\nThe room we stayed in was also amazing!  It consisted of a tile shower and shutters in front of the bath tub.  It was fun to get away for a weekend.  We even ate at TCooks restaurant.  The food was expensive but we enjoyed being pampered like royalty.  Oh and the drinks we just as great!\n\nI would go back to the Royal Palms anytime.  Definitely recommend it!"
0,"My wife and I went back to IDN last weekend and I was kinda bummed to find that the menu had changed (along with the dining room, which was bigger and glitzier) and the experience was overall rather poor.  \n\nIt felt to me like they had fallen in to the classic restaurant trap - get a little bit of success, overexpand, get out over your skis, cut back on the quality, go out of business.  They're only at step 4, but a drag.  We had the greek salad, very little feta - not good.  Entrees were forgettable.  Oh well."
0,This was the most disgusting buffet I've ever experienced. I'm actually sick in my room from this place and I hardly are anything. Nothing was fresh. Everything probably came out of a microwave. \nTerrible brunch.
0,"This review is mainly about service, my wife and I stopped here after wrapping up at the dog park for dinner, Now we both have different tastes so we always split the pizza with different toppings. We were going to order a 3 topping pizza with half salami, onion and green pepper and the other half pepperoni, olive and mushroom. The person working told us it would be $1.50 for each additional topping which I was quite puzzled since we were only getting a 3 topping pizza then he explained that if we wanted different toppings on the other half it would be $1.50 each or $4.50. At this point we walked since I have never had a pizza place charge extra for splitting the pizza."
0,"The service was really bad here! Our waitress was rude and such in a rush? Really strange the restaurant was empty only one other couple sitting at the bar. I was doing the ayce, as I was ordering the waitress walked away and I wasn't even done ordering???? I would never come back here again.. It's sad really nice place but so clueless!"

0,"Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it.  The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die.  The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets.  Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back."
1,"Great food, great value and great service. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating, and, spoke great English! Large menu - maybe could even be a bit smaller. Clean and inviting place."

0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I recently returned home from a trip to fabulous Las Vegas after stay 12/26/13-12/29/13 and staying and the FLAMINGO !! This wasn't our first trip to Las Vegas nor was it the first stay at the Flamingo. It was however the very worse stay I have ever had in any Las Vegas hotel, rude staff horrible customer service and down right horrible house keeping. Aside from all that the real topper was cockroaches the we found in our room. I'm willing to provide the exact number. 15139 and what the hotel desk manager MELINDA said. \"" well this is the desert, what do you expect ?\""  She is a liar and by far the very worst customer service representative I've ever dealt with in 30 years and several. Need less to say they did not stay true to their word and are very very lousy at what they do. I will be following up with. MELINDA'S bosses and pushing strong for some corrective measures and proper training. Lastly $45.36 would not brake the bank for a hotel of that volume and we simply wanted 1 night room rate returned as PROMISED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY WORSE ENEMY TO STAY THERE AND WE WILL NEVER SET FOOT INTO THAT ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN."
0,"I'll come out and say it, the only reason I go to this place is for the beds.  They have a great selection of UWE beds which are by far some of the nicest beds on the market.  Their level of customer service is non-existent and pricing is a little spendy but you can get more bang for your buck if you figure out which bed works best for you.\n\nYou basically have one option, pay $18.88 a month to be a \""member.\""  This gets you unlimited tans in their entry level bed which is your basic 1980's style tanning bed.  If you want to use levels 2-5 beds you have to pay an upgrade fee of $5-20.  Here is where it gets tricky.  If you prepay a set amount ranging from $25-200, you get discounted upgrade fees for each level.  The more you prepay, the cheaper the upgrade fee is.  They have a board that outlines each fee behind the counter so if you have 30 minutes to kill, take a gander at it and try to figure out what you are paying per tan.  Oh and your $18.88 a month is only good at one location, if you want to be able to tan at any Darque location, better up that monthly fee to $22.\n\nI do like the fact that they allow you a pro-rated upgrade fee if you do not go the full max time for each bed.  This is how I save some $$ since I often have a few weeks between sessions and can't go the full time.  The bad news is you have to be a member and have a prepaid balance on your account to get the prorated amount.  The place is always very very clean, they employ a bed cleaner who does a great job!  The AC system keeps it subzero in the building and I have seen them change the bulbs a couple times since I became a member.  They also have a shower in one of their bathrooms incase you are pressed for time but make sure you bring your own towel, they don't provide any.\n\nIf you Mystic tan, this place is a bargain.  I believe the lowest prepaid level of $25 starts Mystic at $15-17 a session which is unheard of here in the valley.\n\nThe reason I gave this place 2 stars is their staff.  They have young girls behind the counter that have no idea what customer service is.  They will have a line of members out the door while they enter in the information of some college kid who just wants their week of free tanning.  They are quick to try to up sell you lotion, a larger package amount or teeth whiteners but slow to get off their personal call while you wait for them to check you in.  If you ask them a question you will get a blank stare and 9 times out of ten their answer will be the priciest thing they have there.  My personal fav?  Their posted close times are 8 or 11 PM but don't tell you that you can't tan if you get there 30 minutes before close so don't bust your butt to get there because you WILL be turned away."
0,"I never gave one star on my yelp reviews. But this dental office doesn't deserve more than that. I had a horrible experience of getting root canal done here. I guessed the dentist didn't numb me enough before the surgery. I felt pain when he started digging my tooth. I told him few time about the pain. All he did was saying \""it's okay and you can do it\"". He finally stopped and numbed me more when I started crying and telling him I felt \""sharp pain\"". Why wouldn't he numb me more at first time I told him about the pain!!!!? I choose this dental office because I was new in Vegas. And it's close to where I live. There are so many nice dentists out there and charge same price like this place does. Don't come here unless you like to be tortured!!!!!!!"
1,"A few weeks ago, we had come here after a long time.  We decided to go again tonight, to see if the last time was a fluke, or they had really gotten that much better.  Well, the answer was...they really have gotten better!\n\nTonight our server was Joel, who was friendly, attentive and quick to refill our ice teas.  \n\nFor our appetizer, we got the zucchini fritte.  It was scrumptious!  The zucchini were cut in small strips, lightly breaded and seasoned, with an amazing garlic aioli dipping sauce.  We ate them like fries, they were so good!\n\nOur caesar salads were actually much better.  The last time, mine was underdressed and undercroutoned (if that isn't a word, it should be).  This time, it tasted like it should, and the parmesan on top was really wonderful.\n\nMy hubby got the same thing he ordered last time (combo of chicken parmesan and fried ravioli), but instead of garlic mashed as his side, he went with fettucini alfredo.  He told me that it was even better than the last time he had it.  I decided to go a little lighter and ordered the wood-grilled chicken.  It was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and juicy.  My side was sauteed green beans, which were really flavorful.\n\nI decided to add the 5th star this time, since they outdid themselves with everything."
0,No no no no. The bartenders were rude and looked miserable. Clearly they hate their jobs as much as I hated being there. Skip this place. Not worth it.
1,"Had an incredible visit today with Chrys, my first time, and I have to say it was the best eye doctor appointment I've ever had. Chrys takes time to really explain what's going on with your eyes, why eye drops are needed in Vegas and what kind and why... She's the dr. for my family. Thanks Chrys and staff you're all wonderful!"
0,"How do you screw up buffalo wings?? I didn't know it was possible.  I am a huge fan of BWW, as evident from how often I check in to the one by my place.  When I was on this side of town, I stopped into the Centennial location and left disappointed.  Server was incredibly nice and the company was good but the wings came out cold and not very tasty.  And I kept thinking my beer tasted like soap.  But sometimes I am weird like that. \n\nBWW is usually pretty consistent and this location was a blemish on its good name.  Definitely check out a BWW, just not this one."
1,"I've been coming here for almost 20 years. I stopped after the first visit, as the place was so smokey. It took me another 5 years before I revisited, and luckily they had become nonsmoking by then. \n\nGood decent food. Great Philly steak sandwiches. The Stromboli is also very nice. Sometimes a wait, maybe 10 minutes at worst. \n\nAlways cute women servers, but service sometimes spotty. I hate that I ask for a minute or two to look at the menu, and then have to wait 10 minutes to order. I wouldn't care if they got rid of female only servers, as long as they were attentive. \n\nThey usually have a good weekly special for $8 or so, with drink. Lots of sports on, if that's your thing."
1,"I am not a huge fan of musicals, but Phantom by far was a very moving experience for me.  The actors' voices were amazing!!  The moving set was amazing!!  I am still trying to figure out how they did it!!  The storyline amazing!!   When we gave them a standing ovation, I had to wipe tears from my eyes!!  A definite GO SEE!!!"
0,"Did the Buffet of Buffets again and have to take stars away from this buffet. The prime rib was still very rare and very good, but the rest of the offerings were sub-par. There was also an unpleasant, rotten, putrid, smell coming from the raw seafood area...I don't know about you but that is not the smell I want coming from my raw seafood.\n\nThe staff was slow, robotic, and scarce. Dirty plates sat on the tables and drinks sat empty for way too long a time. They had changed over from brunch to dinner well over 90 minutes prior to our arrival yet all of the signs on the food were still from brunch and did not match the food that they were describing.\n\nA very disappointing experience."
0,"HONDA WEST ALMOST KILLED ME!\nI always come here for my oil change. Anyway, I had major service done here about a month ago and had oil change, clutch flush, brake fluids, spark plugs and one other thing done (I can't remember). Anyway, I went to Honda Culver City (los angeles) a week ago and they found that all 4 of my brake pads were \""dangerously low\"" and that my car wasn't even safe to drive with brake pads that low. I think the service agent told me that the brake pads were 0.5mm. You can call Honda Culver City to verify. How can Honda West check my clutch, brake fluids and other stuff and not see that my brake pads are that low? I even told the service guy that I'm going to be doing a long drive and asked to check the car. Thanks for letting me drive my car when it's unsafe to do so. Apparently your customer's safety isn't your priority. I could sue you guys for this"
0,"Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!"
0,"We went around 5pm on a weekday and even though it was not super busy we barely saw our waitress. They burned our pizza and didn't tell us they were remaking it until my husband went to see why it was taking 30 minutes for a thin crust pizza. Manager nor waitress were apologetic. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese pops are now little triangles, which were pretty good. Remade pizza was burnt also but we just ate around it. They used to have a case full of cupcakes and treats in the shop connected to the bistro, but when we went the case was bare. :( Where did they go?? Do they only have treats on the weekends? Even the store looked sad, like they weren't stocked on stuff. I had been in there when it opened and it seems to have lost it's luster."
1,"All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here, you may need to be patient. I took me about 3 months to get in to see her, but was well worth the wait."
0,"Nice decor, mediocre food.  Shrimp tacos should not be served in a deep fried corn tortilla with two small shrimp each.  Rip off comes to mind.  Excessive raw garlic in the black beans made them inedible, and I LOVE garlic.  The ceviche was just weird--6\"" strips of fish that were very difficult to maneuver. I tried cutting it to a manageable size in the serving bowl and wound up spilling it all over the table.  And it was ridiculously expensive.  By the way, Restaurant 101 tells you appetizers are to be served before the entrees.  All courses came out together.  Unless they change their menu and techniques, we can expect this experiment to be short lived."
0,"Roman was a good server but was more interested in the fight that was going on. Our empty glasses sat on the table for a good 30 minutes and after I was gonna hand them to another server he swooped by and picked them up only to continue to watch the fight Instead of bringing them back to the kitchen. He the. Handed them off to a waitress and continued to watch the fight. Clearly he was more concerned with what was on tv than actually doing his job.We will not visit this store again. \nFood was AMAZING. This buffalo girl was happy to have a taste of home so far away from home! I'm happy that there are several Wild Wings around here, hoping that they actually play the Buffalo games when hockey season starts up again."
1,"Went here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. It actually exceeded my expectations! \n\nWe had gotten the shumei, the jalape\u00f1o yellowtail, the rib eye, the oxtail fried rice, & the gingerbread pudding! Everything was amazing! \n\nThe jalape\u00f1o yellowtail and the fried rice was definitely the highlight of dinner. Service was amazing and the dessert just blew me out of the water. I generally do not like ginger, but the dessert at blue ribbon was amazing!\n\nWe also got the Malbec they had to offer on the menu & the Yuzu wine.\n\nI definitely would like to come back soon to try more of the sushi they had to offer. What we did have was very fresh, no fishy smell at all!"
1,My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links.
1,"Best breakfast burritos.  I had about given up on this, because of the clueless and tasteless offerings from other restaurants.  Best coffee.\n\nSometimes they will lose track of your order, but this is easily fixed, and I will keep coming back."
0,"It wasn't terrible, It wasn't great. The group I was with had some steak mishaps with the wrong level of cookness. \n\nRaves were the lobster pasta and the salads (not the wedge salad, which I think are stupid anyway). The anchovies were dry. \n\nCrab cakes were good but I've had better. \n\nService was on top of their game, gratuity was included for 8 people so they got double tipped, and didn't bring it to our attention. Our bad. \n\nI expected more from this place."
0,"Food was disgusting the only reason we went there was that we bought a restaurant s.com voucher where you save like 20.00 dollar s so we decided to try it and we ordered a salad , dozen wings , large pepperoni pizza . The lettuce was old the tomatoes where mushy , the wings tasted like they've been sitting for a while , and finally the pizza was flavor less nothing on the pizza stuck out . But that is not the worst part nasty food aside THE STAFF DECIDED TO ADD THEMSELVES A 30% TIP never going there again"
1,"Great bagels, yummy coffee, friendly service. The ONLY reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is they get slowed down significantly by only having one toaster. Sometimes it takes a very long time to get my order. Other than that, it's great!"
1,"After all the years of coming to Vegas and for one reason or another ending up at Caesars, we finally just decided to stay here.  Caesars is kind of the center of the Vegas universe.  They get big names at the Colosseum (ok, Celine Dion and Shania Twain, doesn't thrill me, but they seem to pack them in), they have the forum shops (high end mall), a high end spa (Qua), top notch restaurants  and I suppose you can gamble here too :)  Caesars is the kind of place you can walk in one day and not leave until 3 days later.  That is good and bad.  It has it all, but it is also incredibly large, with a complex floor plan and it takes a lot of hoofing it to get from one end to the other.  \n\nNow, one of the reasons we picked Caesars this time is they didn't have resort fees.  I, like everyone else, detest the useless resort fees that Vegas has begun shoving down our throats.  Caesars didn't used to charge them, however I heard as of 3/1/13 they will be charging away - so be forewarned!  \n\nWe had planned to do the spa and had heard the Augustus Tower was the the newer of the buildings and the spa is in the same tower so we thought we were being smart by booking a deluxe room there. Plus it has it's own check in desk so you don't have to wait in those long lines at the main reception area.  At any rate, they decided to upgrade us (yay!), however we got put in the Palace Tower.  Now we had the single nicest room I have ever stayed at in Vegas, but the PT is SO far from everything I wished I had brought more comfy shoes.  \n\nThe Palace Tower suite (2802) we got was on one of the Penthouse floors. The bank of elevators were way out of the way so they weren't busy and you had added security of needing a key to get to the floor.  The suite itself had 3 full bathrooms w/tvs (which was totally excessive), wet bar, desk, sitting area with TV, dining room, a bed room with a King size bed, a couple of arm chairs, another TV and then of course the double closets, jacuzzi spa and 2 person shower.  It was insane!  I mean, incredibly nice! The only complaint (other than the walk) was that there was zero view.  We basically could see other Caesars Towers (this isn't that big of a deal though).  \n\nI would definitely stay at Caesars again. It has it all!"
0,"Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!\n\nSeeing is the name of this place is \""Rocketburger\"", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........\n\nRocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a \""rocket sauce\"" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird \""tang\"" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.\n\nDiet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!\n\nThe guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back."
1,"I was torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I Settled on 4\n\nFirst off, this is an awesome place to take a date, as it really is one of a kind in regards to the design. The glass panels aren't exactly romantic, but the view definitely is. \n\nI expected the food to be decent and to be paying for the view, but that wasn't exactly the case. I had the Steak and Crab Cake combination as my entree and it was fantastic. I go medium and the steak was just red enough to be flavorful, without the sinewy raw taste you get when its undercooked in the middle. The sauce was great and the portabello mushroom underneath was a great pairing. My GF had the Chicken which she thought was very good (not amazing, but good). We shared the ahi tuna salad which was very nice as well. \n\nOur waiter (I forgot his name, but he had short dark hair). was awesome. The entire meal he was helpful and always there to check up on us. The sommelier was very helpful in helping us pick our half bottle of whine and understood we were on a budget of sorts. \n\nOverall, the food was great if not fantastic, however, at nearly 200 bucks after tip, I can't give it 5 stars for great food, it would have to be some of the best I have had. \n\nAgain, great place to take a Date"
0,Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross.
1,"The store here is laid out very well.  It is more of a custom baby store, but has quality items at all diffrent prices.  Some of them my husband and I were sticker shocked, but with having our third baby nine years after the last lots has changed.  The staff here was very helpful and we will be registering for some of our items for the baby shower."
0,"My wife and I came here a few times when it was Kennedy and enjoyed it enough. Now as it is Presidio, the quality of the entire experience has definitely declined.  The food was OK, not great.  My mashed potatoes were cold and the salmon was a bit over cooked.  The most glaring deficiency is that the service is poor. It started with the hostess with a flat affect and moved on to the wait staff who needs to be trained to be wait staff. I will not be returning any time soon."
1,Tandoori chicken and chicken madras is really good!
0,There isn't a coffee shop at the address given in yelp. I called the number but couldn't reach them.
1,"Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more."
1,So glad this place is open again fresh cut meat and cheese with fresh bread straight from the bakery
1,"I have seen the Mike Hammer Comedy Magic Show and the Broadway Rat Pack Show here. Both shows are well suited to this place thats located inside of the Four Queens Hotel and Casino off of the Fremont Street Experience. This particular showroom is basically all the way in the back of the casino. Like most other casinos, they make you walk through the whole casino so you are exposed to the restaurants, slots, and other other attractions.\n\nI like how the bathrooms are situated where you get in line to get in the venue also another set just outside of the entrance. Another plus is that there no smoking in there.\n\nFor you drinkers they have a full bar just to the left of the stage which I thought was kind of weird but the way they laid it out, it seemed ok to be where its at.\n\nAs for the seating, you have plenty of room for I would say about 80 to 100 people? Plenty of booths are stragetically placed up along the sides of the walls. I would say you have a good view wherever you might sit.\n\nSo check out whatever show that may be playing here for the venue itself will not disappoint.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #130"
0,do not book here !!!! cockroaches everywere! it looks old i swear it does not look like the picture ! false advertisement your better of staying in your car. i booked with them through a thrird party and trust me we decided to pay the cancelation fee then to stay there with cockroaches and a rude i mean rude ass old trailer trash bitter receptionist patti. this hotel doesnt even deserve a star. patti the receptionist is a bitch as soon as we walked in she didn't even want to look up our reservations. she didn't want to take my dads credit card because the name was shortened. she was also very rasist. never again this hotel should be shut down its just taking up space! do not book here once again. even the stupid manager had an attitude !
0,"We met up in Vegas with cousins of ours whose son travels frequently to Vegas on business. He recommended this restaurant, which is a block away from the Fremont Street Experience (see my review of that as well). The steaks were huge but even so, it was a little pricey for being off the strip. The service was average and the d\u00e9cor wasn't anything special and pretty plain (all deep brown wood which might appeal to some). I had the petite New York, which wasn't very petite and my husband had the ribeye, which he claimed was \""good for a ribeye,\"" whatever that means. I usually douse my steak in A1 but it sat untouched throughout my meal. I left wishing we had tried a different steakhouse. Measly servings of wine as well, but you're still overcharged for a full glass. Other than that, nothing much to write home about for this one. Wouldn't go back if we came to Vegas again."
1,"I like Sammys, it's not bad of a chain. I like that they have something for everyone, different flavor fusions. \n\nPizza has a nice crust and I love all the flavor combos- I like the garlic shrimp so far. Duck tacos were good.My favorite thing is the ahi or salmon sliders. I've been to this one like 3 times and a total of 5 times to a different location so I havent tried much, but all has been good and satisfying portions.\n\n Why I give it 5 stars is the service was very attentive, some of the best I've gotten at a casual joint actually. This location has a very attentive staff, back of the house was quick with orders but still cooked things right- kudos! One lunch day in particular a mens baseball team, their kids and familes filled the restaurant soon after we ordered. Our waiter was taking care of us even though they got sieged. Drinks didn't get neglected, had a drink before mine was done. Checked on us often and got our tab taken care of fast.  I do appreciate when people are warm and genuinely friendly- service with a smile does count just as equally as speed and attentiveness."
0,First time going here. Horrible service. Wouldn't recommend anyone going here. I was told two ppl would do my micros n it would take 5 hours at the most but only one person braided my hair and it took nearly 8 hours. The braiders were rude and didnt even acknowledge my presence except when they asked me to pay. It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours I've experienced while getting my hair braided.
0,"This place has been the talk of the town since it opened! Finally arrive to check it out with my son for lunch. I had the baby back ribs. They are served on a plastic tray from coco-cola on paper. I picked the first one up and bit into what I think is beef jerky. The amoke flavor is way to strong for me. The other pieces were like eating rubber. When you bit into it, it was like the snap you get from a braut then chew chew chew. \nMy son had the pulled pork. He enjoyed it and said the meat was tender and moist. \nI may give it one more try with the wife since she has been wanting to come here."
0,"This place is awful! I have rented from this location several times over the years and not once has it been good, but this experience has put me off U-Haul forever. A planned move to Fla has been thrown into total disarray because they screwed up a reservation that I made in person and confirmed in person, 6 weeks in advance! The employees are either dumb or just don't give a shit. They're unorganized and totally clueless. I have never used a business so poorly run. How this store stays in business is a mystery to me and any corporation that tolerates such bad performance from a franchise will not get another $ from me. Or maybe they're all this bad. Regardless, I suggest you use Penske, Budget or carry your shit on your back before using U-Haul!"
1,"Sooooooooo much better than Jamba!!!  And that's saying something for me since I was coming of age when Jamba first came out on the scene and that was when people started to obsess over smoothies.  \n\nMy hubby has gone here a ton and I finally grabbed one with him the other day.  He loves the South Pacific Squeeze and so I went with that for my first time.  Strawberries.  Pineapples.  Pineapple Sherbert.  Orange Juice.  Bananas.  Mmmm mmmm good.  \n\nAll I have to say is...they are better than Jamba for the mere fact Robek's smoothies are way fruitier tasting, less icy (yet still smooth), and don't taste of yogurt.  They are way more refreshing as well.  I'm hooked!\n\nI already went in a second time, this morning, right after yoga.  BTW....they open up at 9 am on Sundays versus their usual 6 am opening on weekdays.  \n\nI'll be heading back soon to try other flavors for sure.  Their boosts are 25 cents extra and definitely worth it."
0,This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again.
1,"For a delivery style pizza restaurant, this place is top of the line. Every time I order form here I am impressed at the quality of food I am delivered. The pizza is much better than those main street chains and aside from the prices other places don't even compare."
1,Great sushi I haven't try the sushi bar but the sushi rolls are delicious. Some many kinds of sushi with a touch of originality.  No complaints at all in so many years that I been going there.
0,Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF.
1,Absolutely delicious. I have never had pita chips like these and quite honestly...I am spoiled now!  Everything we had was wonderful and we made sure to let the guy who runs the place know it!  Will definitely revisit!
1,"I'm a native salvadorean by birth, and these pupusas reminded me of the ones I used to have while growing up in my native land. Rich in flavor, and perfectly prepared. I loved them so much the first time I tried them that I returned to the restaurant 3 times! I've been having one for breakfast daily and ignored looking at my scale daily! Well worth it and delicious. You need to try this place...I never give a 5 to restaurants and because of the service they should be getting a 4 (the waitresses were moody and slightly rude, plus stingy with the condiments that go with the pupusas!!) - BUT because I loved the pupusas so much, I ignored the service. :)"
0,"I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it."
1,"Basically the Italian version of Chipotle, except with much more choices. I decided to try this because all of the customizations sounded appealing. Being that I can't eat certain kinds of dairy the menu was very accommodating. \nWhen I first entered the restaurant there was a manager there that explained the whole concept. You basically decide on a pasta, salad, or piadini (sandwich) and then add the sauce, meat, and toppings that you want. I decided on the pasta bowl with roasted red pepper pesto (which was dairy free, the manager was nice and checked). I added chicken and a bunch of vegetables. With a drink it was about $8, a pretty good value for lunch. My meal was filling and very good, I will definitely return."
1,"Why is this place so fantastic?\nI don't even know. What a great addition to the scene.\n\nI am from Pittsburgh but now live in NYC and the bagel I had here this morning could rival a NYC bagel.\n\nSupport your local businesses, folks. This place is TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Bad, bad customer service. We have to go through these guys because of our home warranty - makes me rethink the whole home warranty thing!\nCalled home warranty Friday because our house was 85 degrees inside. Was told that Cool Blew was already closed, but we should hear something first thing in the morning. Of course we didn't, so I called Cool Blew directly Saturday afternoon.\nI got the feeling that I was bothering them trying to schedule my appointment, and was then advised that someone would come out Monday between 2pm and 5pm.\nMoved my work schedule around so I could be home by 2 to wait. 5:30 comes around and finally get a call from the office that the tech is still at the other job and will be here shortly.\n7:15 rolls around and no one is here. We called Cool Blew and the guy my husband spoke with said he's trying to get ahold of the tech, but the tech isn't answering his phone. He'll call us back when he gets ahold of him. He called back a few minutes later and said that the tech still isn't done and it'll be awhile longer.\nAt this point, we just cancelled the appointment. It's not worth it, and the level of unprofessionalism is blowing my mind! Yes, it's Arizona and yes an A/C repair company will be busy - get more staff! Get people to answer the phone who aren't bothered by customers. It's pretty simple. Keeping in contact with us and being proactive could have avoided a lot of this frustration. If our home warranty company doesn't have another option for a different company, it looks like we'll just have to switch home warranty companies! What a joke!"
0,"Worst upscale restaurant in vegas.  I went with my wife and another couple.  We love great food and have tried many of the great restaurants in vegas.  This is definitely not one of them.  Our friends ordered steaks which were mediocre at best.  I had the halibut which was dry and had no flavor.  I switched it for the salmon which was dry and also had no flavor.  It didn't end there.  We got the mac and cheese which tasted like kraft easy mac mixed with chopped pieces of deli ham.  The mashed potatoes were chalky and bland.  Im really not sure how you screw up mashed potatoes that badly.  I could have done better blindfolded.  Finally, my wife had the lobster, which was just ok, not great.  Overall, the ambience is amazing, but the food just flat out sucks.  To make matters worse, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy.  Las Vegas has too many outstanding restaurants to waste time and money with this place, especially for the price! I will never go back to this place, or to another one of Ducasse's restaurants for that matter."
1,White guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people. Yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant. Yelp was right! So so so so good!
0,"I've been to Benihannas several times in a California and Arizona. I must say that there isn't any consistency with this place. The one here in chandler is not very good. I think they are surviving off of the reputation not customer service. First the girl working as the hostess needs to learn how to smile and actually act like she likes her job. Word of advice for her. If you can't smile, be cordial, have a personality then quit and find another line of work but obviously interacting with the public is not your calling. \n\nVery long wait to eat.... The servers are slow and you have to wait forever just to get drinks and refills...\n\nI think for $100 I can spend it elsewhere and get better service and food..."
1,"Funny how you can live in a city for so long and still find new activities. Every year the Cactus Garden is decorated with Christmas lights. A stroll around the small maze of cacti will take no more than 30 minutes. \n\nWhere other cities have to deal with snow and evergreen trees, we have decked out cacti and palm trees. It comes off as odd initially, but it is a beautiful display. \n\nThe parking is atrocious and it is only going to get worse. The store is jammed pack with visitors. The facility is immaculate for the traffic that comes in and out."
1,Carmen did a great job and was very flexible with times to come in. Nice to find someone that also does men's haircuts in Old Town.
1,"Stopped in this morning for a strawberry watermelon smoothie (delicious - fresh fruit and not too sweet) and came back with a friend for lunch,  Super friendly service, simply decorated, but very comfy and clean and food is excellent.  Ordered the beef noodle soup - the bowl is HUGE,  Enough for two huge (we each ordered one!).  Beef was super tender, lots of noodles and broth was some of the best I've eaten with a wonderful combination of mild, fragrant spices.\n\nWe also ordered the lamb, onion and carrot dumplings and green onion pancakes (excellent).  The dumplings take a while to come out, but its because they're hand made using fresh ingredients - worth the wait!!  Perfectly cooked with lots of filling - an order is 14 dumplings, so a lot of food.  I left with a very full stomach and loads of leftovers!  \n\nLunch (with hot green tea) was $33 and change - amazing price for the quality and amount of food.  They only opened on Tuesday but seem to be doing a brisk business with lots of people coming in for take out (FYI - they have the most extensive smoothie/bubble tea menu I've seen outside of San Francisco Chinatown. Pages of flavor combinations!),  \n\nMy friend and I are going to definitely become regulars here!"
1,"I'm sure my perception of food choices in Vegas is skewed as more often than not they come after a heavy drinking session (either immediately after or the next day).  At that point almost anything would taste great.  Holsteins came highly recommended and after sleeping through the breakfast hour it was time to skip directly to lunch anyway.\n\nWhen presented with a burger voted Vegas's best, it's hard to consider anything else.  I went with the Gold Standard Burger and wasn't disappointed.  Sweet Potato fries were another plus. To top things off I ordered one of the \""boozy milkshakes\"", going with the Oreo and Bailey's version (I wasn't adventurous enough to go for the Captain Crunch).  I left plenty satisfied and a little overstuffed, but overall I would recommend this place for a hearty lunch or dinner (skipping breakfast was a good call)."
1,"YUM!  Fresh is indeed the word for this place, what a delightful stop for a quick dinner.  The owner asked if it was my first time, how I had heard about them, etc. and I told him that I had seen some glowing reviews on Yelp and had to try it out for myself.  He laughed and said when the Yelpers like you, you're in good and when they don't it's not good.  :)  Such a charmer, excellent first impression, but I had to try the food.\n\nAs the other reviews have stated, Greco Fresh Grille is located at Blakeney along the restaurant row portion on the far end.  Parking - meh.  Directly in front of the restaurant is 15 minute parking, so swing on past that towards Bath and Body and Wells Fargo and you should have some luck.  At 5:30 on a Monday, I was a little ahead of the dinner rush, but as I was finishing, folks started to pour in.  I am glad I got there early, as I got a chance to speak with the owner.  \n\nThe food:\nGrilled chicken gyro:  well seasoned white meat served on a warm pita with tzatziki (totally had to look that up) sauce, thinly sliced onions and tomatoes.  Delish!  It tasted bright and fresh, very good.  \nThe fries:  I ordered the lemon with oregano fries (the owner said if you are getting fries to go, the plain or garlic/cumin is suggested as the lemon that is tossed with the fries can make them a tad soggy if you aren't going to eat them soon).  I liked them - different, tasty.  But he was kind enough to send over a sample of the garlic/cumin fries and they were AWESOME.  I like crispy (burned) fries, and these were perfect.  Lightly seasoned and such a tasty change from plain old salt.  Quite good!\nAs Ben stated, they have the Pepsi (sigh), but they do have Cheerwine - YAY!\n\nAwesome Greek music playing, but not loud or obtrusive at all.  If I had any friends to eat with, we could have easily carried on a conversation.  There is a TV that was on the Cooking channel when I was in with subtitles.  \n\nFriendly tip - your breath is going to be WHEEEEYEW from all of the deliciousness, so I wouldn't do this for a first date (or third, *wink*) or before a trip to your dentist (unless you hate your dentist), but any other time would be fabulous.\n\nGreat little spot, the owner and his staff are incredible and definitely made a great impression.  Come for the friendliness, stay for the food, I can't wait to go back and try some more food."
1,"STILL HAPPY!!   The other day I ordered some Kung Pao shrimp and Shrimp Chow Mein for take out that was honestly dreadful.  I called the next day to complain and was asked what I wanted to do.  So the following day (two days after the original take out) I went back and got replacements for the original order.  They did not ask for a receipt, they did not ask for the original containers back,  ALL they wanted was for me to be a happy customer.  No surprise the food was delicious as always.   Every one has an off-day, it is how you react  that is what I look for.   I am honestly relieved that I can still recommend this place and have my old stand-by when I am in the mood for good Chinese food.   Good job guys!!!"
0,Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!
1,"I went to Tableau on the recommendation of two friends who had eaten brunch there the previous day - and who wanted our whole group to go back for lunch before we left Vegas.  Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.\n\nAnd holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  \n\nI started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.  I can't wait to go back."
1,"I have been going to Connie for about 10 years and she has always been corteous and her prices are very resonable.  I go to her for watch repairs, band replacement, batteries and I got my ring resized.  I would definitely recommend Connie to my family and friends."
1,"Came here one night with my hubby. We drank margaritas. The night started out with people singing karaoke, but once people stopped going up the karaoke host rocked it. It was a lot of fun!"
1,Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\n fries are worth the add-on
0,"Going into it, I did have high expectations based on the ratings and reviews I had seen.  My husband and I got cookie dough and cookies & cream.  We both left completely unimpressed with at taste of sour milk in our mouth.  Maybe we just got a bad batch?  I don't think we will be going back again anytime soon."
1,Awesome food and great service. Portions run small so be sure to get an appetizer if you're hungry.
1,"My 1st time here. \n\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\n\nI'll be back for happy hour soon."
0,"I visited Yola's Caf\u00e9 for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.\n\nWhile waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  \n\nWhen my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the caf\u00e9.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.\n\nWe took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.\n\nAfter a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.\n\nAfter another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.\n\nFor what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.\n\nI finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.\n\nOther observations:\n* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.\n* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. \n* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.\n\nSo, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."
0,"I ordered a vegi wrap and fries to go, got back up to the room and found they didn't include the fries (which I watched him ring up as an extra charge). If you charge $23 for wrap and fries I expect it to be good... disappointing."
1,I only went to the target here. Shopping center appeared to be huge.
0,"I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie. \nI ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.\n\n Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop. \n\nMy second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return. \n\nI think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00. \n\nI'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg."
0,"I was in the mood for Fish and Chips, and I'd been thinking about trying this place since it was so close to my apartment. Big mistake. I ordered the Admiral's combo which includes 3 of your seafood choice, fries, and hush puppies. I had the Cod, the shrimp, and the clams. As soon as I get home I dig in, the first piece I had was a clam strip, and it was NASTY; Mushy, undercooked, and extremely fishy tasting. I move on to the shrimp, which was possibly the best cooked out of everything, and the taste was just ok. Finally, the cod, again, slightly undercooked, still gray in color, not flaky, and the batter completely peeled off as soon as I touched it. The fries were, once again, under cooked and soggy. The hush puppies were tasty, but tiny. Worst part about the whole thing is that after an hour of consuming this meal I started getting cold sweats, stomach aches, and a headache. I hadn't had anything else before or after the lunch, so there's no doubt in my mind that the fish (or the poor preparation of it) from this place caused it. I will not be returning to this \""restaurant\"", and will encourage all my friends, co-workers, and fellow yelpers to do the same."
1,"Lalibela is definitely an establishment for food connoisseurs; so if you unfortunately happen to be a good ol' fashioned American (gosh darn it!), requiring your plate of food super-saturated with salt, submerged in boiling lard, priorly frozen, served in a bag, or lacking any sort of flavor other than greasy; then this is not the place for you: for all others, a must. \n\nWE recommend getting one of the three-combination plates (the vegetarian or the MEAT are both excellent) during lunch hours, only $7.99; and it comes with a free fountain drink. Plus, you must try Injera (Ethiopian flat bread). Also as a side note, their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food. \n\nWhat will it taste like may you ask? Think of this, imagine for a second that if it was at all possible for a plate of delicious Indian cuisine to somehow mange reproduction with a full-of-flavor-and-spice plate of Persian cuisine with the ending result a sexy Ethiopian platter of food baby. And there it is--in your mouth."
0,"Horrible experience. Called last Thursday to set up an appointment for this morning at 8am. 8:04, still no plumber. Called them and they tell me he is stuck in traffic and will be here in 30 minutes. No way. Had he left early enough he might be 10 minutes late but 30, absolutely not. He didn't leave 'till 8. I said even if that's true, it's not but let's assume it is, why wouldn't you call me? No answer, no apology. So the \""plumber\"" shows up at 8:28 and I say \""you're 30 minutes late\"" and he said \""28\"". What a dick. No \""I'm sorry\"", such a prick. So, their job is to shut the water off at the street, 9:15, this moron still can't figure it out. Have to wait another half hour for his boss to show up. Finally the water is off, takes 90 minutes longer than promised. What a laughing stock. This company sucks. Their service levels blow. Avoid them at all cost."
1,"I have stayed here on 2 different occasions and I must say both experiences were beyond anywhere else I have stayed on The Strip.  From the high-tech room, the cleanliness everywhere you look, to the staff and the food choices available, it's hard to think of any place on the Strip that beats Aria.  I brought family with me who had never been to City Center yet on this last trip and they were very impressed with the casino and amenities.  My husband says he thinks the Poker Room here is awesome as well.  Upon walking into this casino the very first time, I sort of didn't like it because it didn't look like any of the other casinos.  But as I kept coming back, I started to feel the energy and really enjoy myself here. The architecture and artwork around the entire property is amazing to look at, very different from any other Vegas casino.  The staff are excellent. Had the pleasure of having drinks at 3 of the bars and although they were pricey, they were delicious.... hey, you're in Vegas!  I especially love the beds/ mattresses and pillows they have in the rooms.  I was thisclose to buying pillows on this trip but I'll probably do that next time.  The vanilla scent when you first walk into the lobby can be somewhat annoying but I enjoy it and you can also purchase the vanilla scent sticks there to take home.  I will continue to book a room here in the future whenever I will be in town.\n\nI did have some trouble here and there with the wifi on my iphone, but hey, no biggie.  That doesn't take away from the sheer beauty of this place :D"
1,"I've heard a lot of good things about grimaldis and went to this location after Christmas shopping.\n\nIt was pretty empty.\n\nWe were seated right away and had a male and female server who doubled as the hostess. \n\nThe menu is small, which I like. There are three pizzas to choose from in a large or small and then you can choose your own toppings.\n\nMy friend and I just ordered a mushroom pizza to split and a caprese salad.\n\nThe salad was good, but I can't imagine how you'd go wrong making that. They give you salt, oil, and balsamic on the side. It was a good portion and shareable at $8. \n\nOur pizza was served shortly after.\n\nThe woman served our first slice and we ate the whole large between the two of us.\n\nThe crust is very thin, the cheese was very good, the mushrooms were fresh, and the sauce was just right.\n\nIt was a very good pizza. They found a very good recipe for their proportions and ratios of cheese versus sauce versus crust.\n\nThe only thing that didn't make this a 5 star review is that:\n\n1. They never refilled our drinks until we asked when leaving. Sure he offered a to go cup, but it want busy because he had a bite of food from an off the clock employee's food while he was on the clock but that's beside the point.\n2. A customer leaving broke a wine glass just by putting his jacket on. Although they handled the situation well to make the customer not feel at fault.. They said don't worry it happens all the time.. First they shouldn't keep wine glasses on the table no matter how nice it makes the table setting look since their tables are so close together. Second the staff said it happens all the time and not to worry. It just feels dangerous, uncomfortable for who ever did it, and could be avoided. I hope it doesn't happen all the time for safety reasons.  \n\nI'd return to try their special mozzarella and meats on a more adventurously topped pizza, but maybe not this location."
0,"The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star."
1,So we end up at XS after being unable to get in to Hakkansan and trust me we were not disappointed! This place is incredible the inside was gorgeous and the outside was a great spot to enjoy the music and get some fresh air.\n\nWe end up seeing Rusko  and dancing the night which was a blast.  I would defiantly recommend checking it out here!
0,"ok so steer clear of this place! 1st of all I've eaten there twice before coupls years ago and it was decent enough for my husband and I to decide to buy a \""voucher\"" from tix tonight for a 1/2 price dinner. The tix tonight guy made us a \""reservation\"" and when we showed up they said they would seat us in a few minutes. While sitting there waiting to be seated multiple people kept walking in and getting seatede right away. The only other people left waiting for a table was a group of 6 guys that also checked in with the voucher. Hmmmm.... so we were getting shafted for having a voucher?  So we wait around another 15 mins and finally with an attitude we get called. This is where is gets better low and behold they seat us in the very very back corner far away from where anyone with their little beef skewers are and from the buffet! Then we see them seat the 6 guys right next to us! When we asked to be in the main dining room the hostess said it would be another 20 mins!\n\nWe decided to up and leave and as we left noticied several open tables in the main dining room! This place is a rip off and with so many other options you would think they would get it together! \n\nStay away!"
1,"Man muss schon ein wenig warten, bis man seinen D\u00f6ner in der Hand h\u00e4lt, aber das Warten lohnt sich. Es gibt hier einen halben D\u00f6ner, der mit viel Liebe zubereitet wird, zu einem unschlagbaren Preis.\n\n\n Essen!"
0,"I have NEVER done this, but this place was deserving. I went in for lunch at 11am. The was almost a 1:1 ratio servers:patrons. It took a while for someone to acknowledge that I was sitting at a table, but once he did, he promptly took my order and even suggested the sauce on the side. So, I thought, \""OK....this might work\"" however that is where it ended. 15 minutes later, he must have sensed my lack of patience because he told me that my meal would be right....they were waiting for the chicken. I ordered a chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Now, how long does something like this take??!!! (and where was the chicken coming from??) \n\nEvidently, too long. I got up and walked around the corner to Starbucks, got my coffee and a sandwich and on my way back....still no meal at the table. It is unfortunate that the server has no idea if I left or went to the bathroom. I really wanted to talk to the manager, but I was at a conference on a limited break and he was wandering around a bit bewildered. \n\nGiven all of the other reviews that are even worse than this one, they really should do something about the management - this was not really the server's fault."
0,"I was very disappointed today, I brought my  wife along for a tour the facility and possibly her becoming a member. The sales representative gave her the tour was really lack and didn't give her the full details of the facility.   It seemed like we were bothering him for the tour, it seemed like a real good opportunity to sign my wife up today turned out to be dismal as she is did not sign up thank you for your poor representation by your sales staff.  I would like to suggest that your manager AJ is retrained on how his customer service skills are delivered to your current and future customers."
0,"Seriously...awful. Six representatives moving incredibly slow, I was at front of line and still waited at least 20 minutes before being helped. First car I got into had an engine problem. Second car has stained upholstery and an awful cigarette smell. The third car and eventual winner had 52,000 miles on it and later realized a loud braking issue. Neat. Absolutely awful experience. OH! Let's not forget that once you take the rental car shuttle from the airport you will need to take ANOTHER shuttle to/from their site. I'll pay a higher price next time for convenience, service, and quality. Fox never again!"
1,"Couldn't be happier with my service and experience at this high end bike shop. I strolled in after hours in need of some gear for an early morning spin class. Steve, the owner, was on hand and took his time showing me around and offering me the best deals and some amazing discounts too! I'll definitely be back soon to purchase my next road bike."
0,I paid 28.00 dollars for a childs birthday cake that was two thirds frosting not decorated well .MY CAT COULD OF DONE A BETTER JOB. When I went to pay the premium price for all my groceries evidently I got into a line where the cashier was having trouble with some customer that wanted the price that was advertised but the cashier couldn't make it happen he finally just paid for what he had and left. I was promptly informed by the cashier that her light was off because she was trying to solve a problem. I will never go to this rude disorganized crappy excuse for a grocery store ever again. VONS ON DURANGO YOU SUCK!!!!!!
1,Food was really good! Very good service too
0,"This Subway is dirty. The restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the employees do not change out their gloves as often as they should, the food does not \""taste fresh\""and the cookies are always burnt. If they are out of a cookie flavor they will not take it upon themselves to provide good customer service and bake them FRESH...without burning them. I mean seriously, how do you burn cookies?? This place needs management to step in and shape this place up. BAD"
1,Food was very good with nice size portions.  Wait staff did a great job and owner walked the floor checking and keeping things in order.
1,"My girlfriends and I had heard about this place from another friend we went with and it got a little sketchy when we tried to get in and they asked to see our room key.  We just played the \""oops, silly me\"" card and he let us in anyway.  We wandered around and all the pools were packed, along with all the chairs.  But once we found a place to lay out near the Lazy River, we were GOLDEN!  The inner tubes cost $16 to rent or $20 to buy, and I'm cheap, so I just wandered through the water, swimming, walking, talking, floating...  Although I did purchase a $22 32oz yard drink, and it's only $9 to refill.  Just laying out and returning for a round down the river over and over, drinking all the while...  It was a beautiful thing.  I can't wait to return, the Lazy River seriously made my day!"
1,"I was looking at the graphs which showed I give more positives in my reviews than negatives.  Granted, I admit I would always rather be positive than negative.  Still, I like to be able to be clear with my self about my reviews and the standards I use for how many stars I give.  With this Walgreens, I can give four stars and know why.\n\nFirst of all, my review does not include in anyway the pharmacy, just the rest of the store. Yes, there is one employee who is devoid of any personality.  The rest of the employees I have encountered have been a fairly nice group of people who help me find what I am looking for.   Things are fairly organized so stuff isn't to hard to find. No, not a corner of Heaven but a nice place to go in. \n\nI especially want to compliment the Assistant Manager whose name I can't recall.  I wanted to buy quite few of a Walgreens generic product to save money.  When I asked when there'd be more, this gentleman took the time to ask me how much I needed and why.   He offered to double the next order so There'd be the quantity I wanted the next Tuesday, a rather nice touch for a customer he didn't know.  Not that I am a doubting Thomas, but when I went in the following Tuesday, I didn't know what to expect.  He followed through!   \n\nAnother plus is this store is easy to get in and out of.  For any one who shops on Bell Road,  you know this is a real plus."
1,"Great Store. Perfect for the Scottsdalite that doesn't want to be bothered with actually having to interact with other human beings at a cash register. Everything is automated. I would have given this place five stars but the automated checkout system is not manufactured by Apple so its totally ghetto. Also, plenty of healthy choices are available for those of us who haven't had a carb in over 2 years. I am addicted to their store brand Brie. \n\nIn all seriousness, try their broccoli cheese soup. Fantastic. And there is a great pet store in this shopping center to check out if your in the neighborhood and want to buy your little pal a new toy."
1,"I had my birthday dinner here. It was my first time. I was not disappointed. I had the filet it was so good.  I could cut the steak with a butter knife. For desert, I had the ultimate cheese cake.  It was massive and delicious."
1,"Ive been to many all you can eat sushi places, but this has to be the best one. All the food was great quality and really delicious. I loved the soft shelled crab and the oysters. $22 is not bad for the quality and quantity you get. Great place overall!"
0,Service at the Las Vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area. For some apparent reason I continue coming. Great bar food! Awesome beer!
0,"food sucked, Hot food cold, sushi was not that great. Service was totally horrible. basically a sports bar,  I have been here 3 times, the last time, we just ordered shushi to go, which was totally underheard of, based on how the servers acted.  Seems like a ton of middle school girls work here, girls at front dest sat me down in waiting area, but then not 5 minutes later, asked why I was sitting there.. I went to pay for food at the bar, because it was to go, but then asked to leave a tip?... I didnt. \n\nThe AHSO I would go to is on bell and roughly 62nd Ave.. They great you with a smile, food is amazing, sushi is the best, excellent atmosphere."
0,"Want to spend $$$$ on 'diner' food? Then stop in at BLT Burger. Just glancing at the menu one might think that the prices are somewhat reasonable, but beware. Fries are NOT included. Yep. That's extra. I had a Tex Mex burger which was decent but I've had better, and bigger elsewhere. The bun was soggy and it fell apart after the first bite. The spiked milkshakes on the other hand are awesome. Grandma's Treat is a wonderful concoction of Makers, vanilla, caramel, and nuts. All in all I would go back to BLT but only for the $11 (gulp) milkshakes."
0,"Quick and easy but I wouldn't say it was \""good\"". More like to late to cook dinner, super hungry, deal with the quality, place."
1,"I heard about Cosmo and said \""Okay, time to go check it out.\""\nSpectacular view of the Bellagio's water show. It's worth upgrading to be on Bellagio view side.

1,"The Tumble Inn is a no-frills sports bar on the edge of downtown Champaign - they have a bunch of TVs, a lot of domestics on tap, and there's usually a barbecue truck parked out front. I have been here on several occasions at off-peak times to watch sporting events, and each time has been thoroughly enjoyable."
1,I have eaten here several times. The customer service is amazing and the food is very good. I really enjoy the atmosphere.
1,"GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees. The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!"
0,"Do not use this dry cleaners.  They do not accept responsibility for damage to the garments iothey clean.  My husband took a shirt in that he picked up the day before.  It had a huge rip down one of the sleeves.  The response he received was \""it happens\"".  A $70 shirt ruined!  There was no apology - instead he said it was a \""used\"" shirt.  Aren't the clothes we take to the dry cleaners to be cleaned \""used\"" clothing?  What a ridiculous remark.  Luckily we have other choices for dry cleaning in Anthem because we will not be returning to My Cleaners."

I informed her about the advertised prices and she insisted that the prices where for other items yet their was no advertised price for the item I was purchasing, and their where about 7 more of the same items in the same spot under the 1.19 advertised sign. \n\nShe stated she would not give sell me the item for the advertised price. I than proceeded to explained to this young lady about Retail law she still refused and I asked for Managers name and store number she refused to give Managers name and number. \n\nHowever she said I needed to come back in the next morning if I wanted to speak to manager around 5:30 AM.  Very rude.  \n\nTo continue, It clearly states If item is marked on shelf differently than what price comes up on Register the advertising  price is what the customer pays. \n\nYet she refused to abide by the laws so I am filing a complaint. This is not the only place I will be filing a complaint."
1,"This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!"
1,"Back in Feb I came to Las Vegas for a weekend getaway with the then bf (now ex). He was being deployed to Iraq and was doing a 3 month training in Cali. So we met in San Diego and drove to Vegas together. I had made reservations for us to stay at the Bellagio and as a surprise to my very Alpha Male ex, made reservations for a couples massage in the Bellagio Spa. \n\nUpon arrival we were greeted and lead to our separate changing areas. We were told to take advantage of the spa areas (separate for male and female) and then we could meet in the general area and we'd be called when they were ready for us to come into the massage area. Along the way we were also given a tour of the other facilities that were available for our use. Including the meditation room. \n\nSide Note: If you come to The Bellagio Spa, TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDITATION ROOM!!!!! OMG.... When I grow up to be rich and successful, I want to mimic the Bellagio Spa Meditation Room in my house. Imagine a dimly lit room with little waterfalls and reflection pools... The calming sound of running water and a little added sountrack of nature sounds... Breathing in and out, deeply and in rhythm with the sound of water... Ahh.... \n\n*snaps back into reality*\n\nOk... So we're called and greeted by our masseuse and lead back to our room. The room is a typical spa room that was set up with two massage tables. We are given our choice of massage oils and then we settled on our individual tables. The massage was going wonderfully and there is a part where they do a hot stone massage. The masseuse places hot stones between each finger and each toe and several along your back. \n\nSo it's peaceful and relaxing and then all of a sudden you hear a loud snore and the sound of rocks dropping to the floor... \n\nYes... My ex fell asleep and jerked wildly as he always does when sleeping and all of his rocks fell to the floor.... At this point I burst into uncontrollable laughter which made my masseuse start to laugh as well... I couldn't catch my breath for about 5 min.... \n\nBut yeah... The massage was great. But I'll have to agree with Tony L on this. I'm knocking off 1 star for price. It's a great place, but for that price, it ain't all that great...."
0,"This is a review of my lunch experience.  I had lunch with two friends last week and JDS completely failed on both service and food.  From being seated to the time we got our check was one hour and fifteen minutes.  Really, for lunch?  In fact, one of my guests took about three bites, asked for a box and almost immediately had to take her lunch with her back to her office.  Oh I forgot, my other guest ordered a plain hamburger, well done, on just a bun.  This is how he always orders a hamburger, so he is always very clear with his order, he knows is not common.  Pretty easy, right?  Instead, he gets a cheeseburger with some lettuce.  Wrong!  I got a simple steak sandwich at a steak house, and it was just plain bad.  No flavor, absolutely no flavor.  There was one highlight, the french onion soup.  It was very good.  Overall, an incredibly disappointing experience all around.  I would be very reluctant to go back for lunch."
0,"booked a spray tan here after a visit to the highlands and before my train back to London. greeted by a cheerless young lady who made no attempt to chat, rushed the treatment, told me i could only dry off for half the time i requested (despite no evidence of other customers waiting for the room). having taken payment she didnt even say goodbye or help me struggle through the doors with all my luggage. a miserable even hostile attitude to a new customer (who certainly wont be returning)."
1,"Beautiful decor! They gave us some free champagne since were there for our honeymoon. The tasting menu is very decadent, with caviar and truffles. If you like sushi, this is the place to go."
0,"If I could give this place less than one star I would. Where to start, first off they re-heat old French fries in dirty oil. Even after I called back the second time to ask them not to. Their food is sub par and dirty. Now all that aside I had an issue with them messing up an order and called in to ask them to fix this, the girl over there was rude and defensive to my claims that the wrong toppings were placed on the burger we had ordered. I specifically said no tomato and she specifically repeated that back to me as we'll so I know it wasn't her fault. She passed me over to the manager who was really mad that he had to come to the phone and explained to him that the person is allergic to tomatoes and that we'd appreciate it if they could send us a new one...he said rudely \""no just scrape the fu@$ng tomato off. I told him that she's allergic and that there is still tomato all over even if we scrape it off. He said too fu&$% bad we're not sending you anything. I asked him why he was so mad and he said cause I'm fu%^# busy cooking wtf do you want and hung up. NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Bottom line aside from the fact the employees are so jaded and disgruntled the food is just nasty dirty re-used oil re-heat fries and just dirty!"
0,"I'm probably at between 1 and 2 stars but I guess I'll round up since I've never seen any bug or so enter my apartment (I was on the 7th floor) and I'll try to be very very unbiased here but if you want to the sweet short version:\n\nWouldn't recommend. Can absolutely find better for a lower price. Please do me a favor and rent elsewhere.\n\nThe long version (it's going to be really really long, but informative):\n\n1) Location is great - right by UNLV. I'm a student, however, the small charges here are awful. $30 a month to park with a shade over your car, $50 additional on top of rent if you live above the 5th floor. Also, the back-end in entering the apartment tower is poorly built. if you are entering, you push. but let's say you're trying to get to the back-end from the apartment tower...it's also push. Which means you have two doors colliding all the time when people are trying to enter or exit the apartment.\n\n2) I had a deal when renting here..and didn't remember until I signed the lease why I didn't want to live here (myself included, and friends, lived here as a last resort, not by choice) and that's because at the end of your lease, rent increases by 10%. My deal though when renting here, $705 per month, so 8 months I would have coupons that deducted $200 off my rent price and the remaining 4 I would pay $985 (because I had a shade for my car $30/per month then $50/per month living above the 5th floor)\n\n3) To do laundry, you need a laundry card. Weird because when you enter the laundry room, there's a slot to insert quarters lulz. But yes, a laundry card to do laundry, per card is $10. after you load money onto this card is when you can proceed to do the actual laundry. It's weird how they dedeuct the money off your card when you get to $.50 and even worse because you can only load $2,$5,$10 and $20 bills... That's right, you cannot even load $1 bills and/or coins.\n\n4) Their lease, is ridiculous. When you sign, do beware that you CANNOT break it under any terms (my reason for this whole review) also, when you move out, you know how you have to give a month in advance? BE SURE TO DO THIS. Because if not, ON THE LEASE, it states \""if failure to do so, the lease will continue on until an additional 12 months\"" ... which means, if you don't tell them you're leaving, you're bind to that apartment for an additional YEAR. \n\n5) I never understood why it was very important to know if you could break a lease. What happened with me unfortunately was that I got severely ill and had to move out of state and I was already 6 months into my lease. My co-signer, my father, was able to pay rent (hardly knew English and had to get consist help from the bf to deliver the rent because we were all out of state) and with that, therefore I was bind to my lease. Such assholes. They're smart though, getting a co-signer. But serious assholes. Because failure to pay, would ruin my dad's credit. The property managers or agents working there were no help of this situation. Sure they were symapethic but because it was \""Vegas tower management\"" who had said no, it wasn't in their power or control to do anything - these people are a bunch of turd.\n\n6) Lastly, after being through everything, and reading all the reviews here, I wanted to make sure I received my security deposit back of $500. I kid you not, I spent literally 2 and a half weeks, thoroughly cleaning my apartment, even cleaning the bolt cap cover kit of my bathroom to laying newspaper around my kitchen to make sure my shoes don't leave marks after I wipe. And in the end, I did receive it but absolutely busted my ass too.\n\nSadly this place won't ever closed. They're more affordable than Las Vegas Grand and more secure than other apartments around the area.\n\nBut when getting the mail, the mailman would show me at least half the rooms are vacant...\n\nAnd now you know why."
0,"DO NOT GET THE M - POWERED crap they offer. . My mistake that I thought it was a great idea, save power,  money and have access on my smartphone. I was completely wrong.   \n* the guy that came in to install the thermostats walk into my brand new home, with his dirty shoes,  not even wearing those shoe covers.  3 weeks later my thermostat downstairs stop working but for some odd reason the fan was still on. To turn it off I had to turn off the power supply at the breaker box. I had 2 different guys come out and blame it on my BRAND NEW units.  Its ironic that my unit decided to have issues the same exact time their thermostat did. They kept insisting that I need to have an HVAC guy to come out, of course I would be responsible for paying whatever work they need to do... At the end of the day I wasted my time and my energy dealing with this M-POWERED crap. I had them remove both thermostat and now I need to hire an HVAC guy to fix their mess"
0,"Talk about a disappointment! \n\nI want to first say that our server was amazing and tried his best to give us the best service ever. Thank you!! \n\nMy friend and I were hungry after a late night on the town, we were staying at MB and were craving burgers. We got there and were seated right away. My friend ordered the French Dip Steak and it was horrible! The meat was dryer than the Las Vegas heat, no taste! The soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting. Meanwhile I had the hamburger that had no taste to it. \n\nNow usually if we were paying a cheap price, you get what you pay for. But these orders were $20 bucks a piece. And I understand that it's late at night, but either lower the price or give us fresh food. We let our server know that we didn't like our food (we couldn't even finish it) and didn't want anything else. Then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and \""apologized\"". Yeah, whatever dude. At the end of it all we did get a cut off our total, but the whole experience was a total let down. If you're going to be serving food, all I ask is for it to be GOOD. Avoiding this place from now on."
0,"Ok.. This place....... is junk.  I'm sorry to be so brutal, but there comes a point when you just gotta do something different.  This place has zero uniqueness and creativity.  The food was awful and tasted like frozen dinners.  (I like frozen dinners when I'm staying home and not spending my hard earned dough.)  Wings were baaaaaad.  THIS JUST IN: YOU ARE A WING BAR!!  If your wings are bad, what the heck else are you going to do.  Only shining points were the size of the place and the location.  It is a rather large restaurant right in the Epicentre.  Other than that.. Avoid!! There are 10x cooler places in the Epicentre to go to.. See Mez and McCormicks.  ANYTHING is better that this joint.  Do not Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
0,"We got here at 11:30am for a late breakfast and were seated within 10 minutes. \n\nThe drinks took longer to come out than our wait for the table. After ordering and waiting about 15 minutes they refilled our drinks and the waitress mentioned that since we ordered french toast it will take longer. \n\nA whopping 25 minutes later we get our food (total of 40 min wait) we get our food. The waitress even says to us \""you guys must've been starving with how long your food took.\"" NO KIDDING. \n\nThe food ended up being just Ok. Will not be coming back here.."
1,"One of the most frustrating layouts of a restaurant I've ever been to. Two \""front\"" doors, bathrooms placed too far away from the bar and the dining area, strange patio layout.\n\nFOOD: Possibly the best French onion soup I've had in Phoenix. The burger wasn't earth shattering, but was good."
0,"Nothing overly bad about it.  It's your standard Peter Piper.  I think my problem was more with the clientele than the employees or the facility.  I was born and raised in the barrio, but come on......kids were acting like their parents weren't even there.  When your kids are over ten, you need to let them know that Peter Piper and Chuck E Cheese aren't really for you anymore.  These kids were ten and twelve acting like they were five.  My grandma would have smacked em.  My parents would not have taken us there in the first place.  If it were just for the food and employees, it would be a three.  The customers make it a 2.  Rude!"
1,"This place is the best, cheap, good and fast!  I know other Mexican chains are more common throughout the valley but this place is so good.  Just writing about it makes me want to get in the car right now and go get some.  I love all of their breakfast burritos but specifically like potato egg and cheese one.  The classic 2 taco meal is another good way to go.  It's open 24 hours and has a drive-through.  We've actually never been inside.  My only minor complaint is that the tea always kinda old tasting.  Everything else is super fresh and delicious, though!"
1,"My boyfriend and I took a last minute trip to Vegas, and based on reviews, made a reservation at Cut.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we walked through the door the service was friendly, accommodating, and attentive from the hostesses, to the bartender, to our two waiters.  Wine choices were on par. Nice, simple decor.  Excellent presentation and recommendations on types of steak.  Did not skimp on the bread (which unfortunately we took full advantage of).  We shared the American Wagyu Beef porterhouse for two and it was possible the BEST steak I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection.  Sides of mac and cheese and caramelized cauliflower also did not disappoint.  We finished with a huge and yummy chocolate souffl\u00e9.  The whole experience was a delight.  Great meal, great atmosphere, great service.  You can't ask for much more.  We definitely made the right choice with this restaurant."
1,"This place is fun and the food is delicious, great service and location! Try it before or after catching a movie!"
1,"Loved it! I was in Vegas with the girls in early '05. We did a VIP dinner/club/limo thing but this wasn't one of the stops. However, we did manage to swoop on by on a different night. We couldn't leave LV without partying at the Wynn. Had a cabana right by the water (it was gorgeous!) & Patron all night. This place had a swanky but chill vibe. I haven't been to many clubs in Vegas but this has to be my favorite one so far. I've told the hubby & he has it on his itinerary for the next time he goes to Vegas with the boys (maybe not such a good idea). lol."
1,Lovelovelove.  I'm not too adventurous when it comes to food but I really like their menu.  Lots of chicken dishes and all sound great.  I've tried a few things but none of which I can remember but I know I liked them all.\n\nGood mojitos and dancing later in the evening too.\n\nDefinately an enjoyable place.
0,"This place used to be great. Had good coffee, helpful staff, etc. Now this place is junk. 8 people working yet only two of them are making the drinks. the girl at the register doesn't know how to use the pos, and the other employees are running around doing dishes. not to mention there's alaways a group of people huddled around waiting impatiently for their order. the quality of coffe isn't the same either. tastes as if it's been watered down and they use too much cream. If I'm going to wait 20+ minutes for my coffee it better be good. Just run accross to Von's and get a starbucks coffee or go home and make your own."
1,"I would give this additional stars if I had the option.\n\nMy husband and visited Pittsburgh for our anniversary 8/2/2014 and based on reviews we decided to have our special dinner at the restaurant Root 174. We couldn't decide from the tempting and unusual choices so we ordered the Tasting Menu with 6 courses, priced at $67/person. The waitress (she was superb; attentive, friendly, helpful and informative) cautioned us that we should not order this if we're at all picky or have allergies/aversions. We are foodies. We wanted the chef to enjoy himself and pull out all the stops, and we happily gave ourselves over to being surprised. This turned into a very generous assortment. I was expecting like one tiny bite of everything; not so. \n\nEach course was delicious, and all different. I will not itemize each one here as there were so many and I honestly can't rate one over another, they were all that good. One conclusion we agree upon is that like a musical composition made up of component parts, each of these creations blended seemingly disparate ingredients in a completely harmonious way. Yet each part retained its own identity; you could really enjoy the ripeness of the fig appetizer whose sweetness contrasted by the creamy bleu cheese; the sharply vinegar white anchovies against the creamy-custard poached egg in the caesar salad; the perfectly tender mild octopus with the vibrant and spicy romesco...well, you get the idea. This is a tiny restaurant (seats only maybe 40), and nearly invisible to the passer-by. In fact, it was raining hard and we walked right by the entrance and missed it on the first pass; I guess we were trying to avoid puddles. \n\nYou gotta look for it. And it's SO worth the effort!! We both agreed that this is probably the most memorable dinner we've ever had, and we have visited many wonderful places. Keith Fuller is an artist, and this restaurant is a gem. We look forward to our next visit."
1,"I like that this hotel is located south and away from all the crazy action that is \""Las Vegas\"". Its right off a main road so it's easy to get to and there is a bar/restaurant right across the parking lot which also comes in handy. The check in process was super easy and the decor is beautifully updated. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast offered in the morning was also delicious....blueberry pancakes smelled and looked awesome. There is also eggs, sausage, yogurt, fruit and pastries. We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely come back again."
1,"Cool atmosphere, nice hot chocolate and in one word : Chocolate heaven"
0,"We stopped coming here, there are just too many Large Dogs roaming leash-free with little or no supervision. I reported to Animal Control and Park Police. Large dog poo all over the place too. We now drive extra 10 mins to a park in Seven Hills, much much better well kept park with more Respectable dog owners."
0,"Treasure Island in my opinion, is one step above from Paris.  This place has alot more sad people who lost all their money.  When i play roulette here, i hear behind me \""dude you have to play $15 each time? thats too much!\""  I turn around to see who it was and I'm not surprised.  Anyways, this place is a joke.  The only time I come here is to eat at Social House, which is great food!!!  Too bad its at a place like TI.  They have the shuffle monster for all the bj tables outside, and single deck which is 5-6 payout, youre get ripped off idiots!  They need a bigger high limit room.  One unisex bathroom?? Give me a break!"
1,"I was hosting some friends for a Mexican themed dinner and realized I had no dessert! I quickly yelped \""dessert\"" in my area and this bakery was the first listing. It is less than 2 miles from my house and the reviews highlighted tres leches, which was perfect for my theme! \n\nI popped in at about 5 and although they were out of the big tres leches cakes, they had two smaller sized ones (smaller size = enough for 1-2 people)  that I picked up along with a tiramisu cup and a cream puff. All of this for under $20! Nice! :) \n\nOnce dinner was over, I took these babies out of the fridge and my friends all did this: O_O. Saying the tres leches cake was a hit would be the understatement of the year. Although there were only four of us, I'd be willing to say that if I had bought the actual standard sized cake version, it probably wouldn't have stood a chance. It was delicious, moist, flavorful, rich, sweet, and perfect. It was all you'd ever want in a tres leches cake. \n\nThe cream puff and the tiramisu were standard for these desserts - no worse or better than most others I have had. But, WOW, that tres leches was special. \n\nAlso, they have a wide variety of cupcakes and these little ball cake things that look amazing and truffles and such. I will be back to do more sampling ASAP!"
1,"My son had a blast here. \n\nWe went on a lazy Sunday afternoon, around 1pm and stayed until 4pm.\n\nWe only paid $10 for an all day access (unless you go out and decide to come back later, then you have to pay again)\n\nI wish we packed some food though, because you can basically pack your breakfast, lunch and dinner and stay there all day and still pay $10.00.\n\nI didn't have any problems with other kids, or moms not watching theirs. \nIt was a really good experience for us.\n\nBesides, you can't bash a business when that happens to you. The parents are responsible for their kids, not the business.\n\nThe place is clean. I don't mean SANITIZED but it doesn't have the sticky feel or look to it, and the play sets are not dark or dirty or anything.\n\nWOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"
1,I have to say I am a fan! The Stetson Chopped salad has got me hooked on this place. I literally get it go once a week! I have taken pretty much everyone I know here just to get this salad! \n\nThe Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is also a great choice! If you still have a sweet tooth at the end of your meal definitely try the Apple Cobbler with brie cheese crema and duck fat ice cream! WOW its truly amazing and so different from any apple cobbler I've ever tasted. \n\nThe service here is always great and they are friendly and quick!
1,Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.
0,This place is so outdated... the rooms are for those who just want to have a place to crash... maybe with a group of friends on a whim trip! The location is nice for going places on the strip but this hotel is in need of major repair!
0,NO STARS FOR THIS PLACE!!! We wanted to eat here only because they had charging stations for our car. But guess what 2 suv's were parked in the spots and the sign clearly states NO PARKING UNLESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE  thought maybe the manager would help us out but he basically said F U... Not getting my business guess I have to at least give one star but can't make a review with no stars
0,"Horrible, horrible place.  Wannabe Paris Hiltons abound as do the greasy Rico Suave guys with their striped, button down shirts (top buttons undone to expose their drain clogging chest mat.)  Semi-famous hockey players, people palming Benjamins, washed up celebrities (Britney for New Years?!  C'mON!) and the Pussycat Dolls get to cut in line.  Once you're in, you have no idea what all the fuss was about."
1,"One of our FAVORITE places in Madison!  The best pizza in Madison, hands down. The crust, sauce and fresh toppings are all perfect, and the salads were fresh and delicious as well. (sylvetta salad was our favorite} The location always made it a great outing,located across from Trader Joe's and near Art Gecko.  We mill Pizza Brutta! This will be a spot we will not miss next time we are in Madison."

0,"Definitely won't be back. My friend and I had the steak burrito and another friend the chicken. Steak tasted like it could've came from a can (not that it did bit could've lol). \n\nPaid $1.25 for a little teeny thing of sour cream (takeout order). $21 total for 2 steak burritos,  fries and sour cream. Had I known before we got back home I definitely would not have put that on my tab. \n\nFries we're greasy...they looked burnt but didn't taste like it. My friend with the chicken burrito enjoyed it. All meals came with chips and another teeny thing of Pico de Gallo. I was so hungry I ate half of the burritto and then stopped....it was pretty bad. Granted we got there a half hour before they closed but that shouldn't be an excuse :("
1,"A recent compliment from another Yelper reminded me that I haven't reviewed this place on Yelp yet. So thanks Betty B for reminding me!\n\nI have a friend who grew up in Montreal (he speaks fluent French, Italian & English) who told a work colleague and I to spend the weekend in Montreal with him after attending a conference in Toronto for the week. We took him up on his offer and this dining extravaganza was the culinary highlight of the trip.\n\nThis was just before the ban on foie gras went into effect in California, so our friend took us here to make sure we could overload on it...and we did.\n\nThere was so much that looked so good on the menu, three grown men wept with joy and giggled like schoolgirls.\n\nEven though it's not on the menu right now, the foie gras with maple syrup was amazing. We then dove straight into a second foie gras dish,  naked foie gras.\n\nOur third foie gras foray was the foie gras poutine...NOT to be missed!\n\nThen we had a pig dish and the Fowl for 2, which put us over the top. They were both completely off the hook. The whole chicken had a morel mushroom gravy that was so good you could have filled a coffee mug full of it and drank it straight down.\n\nThe wines?  Oh...the wines... \n\nTheir French wine selection was ridiculously amazing. We guzzled bottle after bottle with our meal like we were with Bacchus himself.\n\nThen came the desserts. It may have been the foie gras delirium, but each one was better than the last. We ordered three, struggled to finish them, but we had to because they were so good.\n\nHours after we got there, we stumbled outside feeling sated & slightly sinful at the end of this magnificent foie gras feast. \n\nBottom line? If you are within 500 miles of Montreal, make a trip to the wonderful city and this deliciously decadent restaurant. You'll thank me if you do."
0,"DON'T GO HERE!!! I went to see Dr. Carrie Cashman, after finding a lump in my breast. I had already had a hand test and ultrasound at other places. I had my appointment and was told NOTHING that I didn't already know, after waiting almost 2 hours to see the doctor and I arrived early. She made a guess at what she thought it was and gave me my options, biopsy, surgery if it's cancerous etc. Already was told that but ok. I asked for the prices of removal which she then proceeded to give me phone numbers and told me to call them and ask, really they can't even call for me? But ok, let it go. Finally I go to pay, told them I didn't have insurance and would be paying out of pocket, she told me it was 130, I paid and left, nothing else was said. It's been a month and I just got a bill in the mail for 115 dollars from them! They did not once say the appointment was 243 and they'd be splitting it up or absolutely anything of the sort! They are literally trying to steal my money and have done absolutely nothing! If I could give them 0 stars I would. I will not be having my surgery done through this business."
0,"I was just discussing the upcoming summer concert season with a Chicago Yelp guy.  I mentioned the pickings this summer and how I'd likely not be spending a lot of $$ this summer.  I told him, \""At least you have Jam Productions in Chicago, so you have some competition.\""  He then reminded me of the proposed Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger.\n\nEek!\n\nNo matter what BS Live Nation tries to cram down our throats about how great this would be for the average concert goer, I'm not convinced.  I guess if you like Miley Cyrus or whatever the latest flavor of the month is, or if you like your latest prepackaged classic rock/oldies shows, then by all means the Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger will benefit you.  \n\nBut what about the rest of us?  What about those of us who want something else besides bands still coasting on their hits (or hit) of 30 years ago?  What about those of us who don't want to shell out over $100.00 a ticket for the umpteenth Eagles reunion show.  And yes, the Eagles were the first band to charge over $100.00 per ticket!\n\nSo let's take a look at what Live Nation is offering us at First Niagra Pavillion (that's the Star Lake Ampitheater for you old-timers) in summer 2010:   http://www.livenation.com/venue/first-niagara-pavilion-tickets\n\nLet's see:  \n\n1) Styx with Foriegner;\n2) Lynyrd Skynyrd God & Guns Tour w/ Bret Michaels of Poison & 38     Special ;\n3)  Iron Maiden \n4)  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Drive-By Truckers (that one would probably be good)\n5)  John Mayer (I used to like him, now he creeps me out)\n6)  Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band (Man, how many times do YOU wanna hear \""Margaritaville\"" over and over?).\n7)  Kings of Leon (okay, this one might be good).\n\nWhatever.  I'm getting to the point now where I'd rather see some indie act at a small club or theater for a lot less $$."
1,"I was surprised to find this place stuck inside the Fremont Casino.  It's a nice romantic steak house, and while you're in their you forget that you're even in a Casino. \n\nFirst they bring over bread and 3 different toppings for the bread. Butter, garlic Olive oil and an eggplant spread. All were great and the bread was fresh and warm. \n\nI ordered the New York Strip with gorgonzola on top. It was served on top of crispy fried onion strips, mashed potatoes and broccolini. I usually don't care for steak while out, but this was delicious. And my steak was actually delivered medium, like I ordered (something I wasn't expecting for a steak house inside a casino).\n\nThe servers were all nice and the atmosphere was relaxed and peaceful. It was a nice getaway found inside the hustle and bustle of a casino."
0,"No toaster. NO TOASTER. WHY must the best bagels in CLT be forced into a sauna to steam away all their crusty, crunchy potential?\n\nToppings are diverse, coffee is good. Staff is cute and stoned. Decor is rad, and I feel totally comfy, until EVERYTHING IN MY 6 DOLLAR BREKKIE SAMMICH comes pouring out, onto my lap, onto my dry-clean-only Interview Shirt, and then that's it - I'm throwing a tantrum (in my head at least) and tossing the wet mess into the bin. Give us the option, kids. Don't be Steamer Fascists."
0,"The guy handing me my food had dirty finger nails! EFFING GROSS!\n\nI went through the drive thru and decided on a pollo bowl, I wanted to add cheese and he said it was one dollar more.... REALLY? What a rip off! I got to work and was taken aback! Literally, a bowl filled to the brim with rice and beans and 1/4 of a small breast! BOO!\n\nI tasted it and was turned off, the chicken was bland and dry and it just wasnt yummy! Had I got the cheese and added salt then yea, but seriously EPL?? I also got some red salsa and it wasnt good. Just a sad visit!\n\nWhat was the worst is that the guy at the window had long DIRTY fingernails! OH HELL NO!"
1,"Just a shout out for Ginger Luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair! She is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter, Madisson, will let touch her hair.  Thanks for listening and loving what you do! :)"
0,"We arrived here on a Saturday night after making a reservation and still had to wait 1/2 hour for our table. When we finally did sit, there were empty tables everywhere. \n\nThe waitress introduced herself and then left for 10 minutes without taking a drink order. I ordered a hot and sour soup with the lobster entree. The soup was great, but the lobster was just ok. Definitely not worth $40.\n\nThey forgot a few of our orders and took literally 15 minutes to run the credit card. I definitely won't be returning"
1,"Changing menu based on available good stuff, bar marco has that old world italian simplicity down with a great palate. Everything we tried was top notch. New owners make it more open and with a friendly but slightly classy atmosphere, but it's not a place you go in if you are in a rush. Like in Italy...take your time here."
1,"Brian was very nice and professional. He cleaned all the tile in my house for a reasonable price. The tile looks great, we can definitely see a difference in grout color. There were a few spots that didn't pick up the sealer and he was kind enough to come back the following week and redo them. He was very knowledgable and I would recommend him for any cleaning job. I was very pleased with how attentive and detail oriented he was. Make sure you use Bradley Carpet Cleaning!!"
1,Love it. From out of town needed a mani pedi and they were great. Close to the strip and great quality nail work. Friendly staff
0,"We decided to give this a try before a show at the mirage.  We have been to several Texas de Brazil's and Fago's and like the style.    Samba has much fewer choices.   We were there about an hour and got to try 6 varieties of meats.    The server Tim was nice and informative about the  meats.   Our waiter has very hard to find.   It's very noisy your sitting in the middle of the casino and can hear drunks  and slot machines, bad atmosphere.   It's very over priced for the total package.   For the food quality atmosphere ext it should not be more than $30 per person.   Your better off going to the buffet than eating here."
0,"Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. \n\nHaving lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \""taste of England\"" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. \n\nI guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). \n\nP.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised."

1,"Their Sea Bass and Scallop dish with verjus is the best thing I've ever eaten. Two words: Tomato Jam. \n\nIt is not cheap, but worth the money. I look forward to returning and highly recommend it. \n\nI tried foie gras for the first time ever and was impressed. Both times I have been here (had the Sea Bass and Scallop dish both times... it's THAT good) we tried a cheese plate. The first time we asked our server what kind was good and she suggested the Bellavitano. I still feel like I owe her for this. A friend and I joke that Bellavitano brings people together.The second time we had that and the Moody Blue. Also a find. \n\nIf you are looking for a quality, delicious dinner and are not concerned with the price, Eno Vino is your answer."
0,"I was disappointed that the basics (like on and syrup) were procured from a vendor versus being locally acquired (e.g. fresh squeezed on and actual maple syrup).\nThe menu items suggest a Hawaiian influence, and I would recommend that you stick to those items.\n\nThe flavor of the burrito was insipid. The poached eggs were soggy (they brought them in a bowl that was filled with either water or uncooked eggs), the fruit bowl had very little to it (5 grapes, where 2 were rotten, 2 overripe strawberries, 1 cube of melon), and everything was soaked in butter.\n\nThe  best bet is the pancakes (the title character in their menu) and the Portuguese sausage.\n\nI also noticed that the decor near us was covered in dust curtains. This makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.\n\nThe server was very nice and accommodating. The food came promptly.\n\nOverall, this place is trying to be too many things ( pancake house, Mexican breakfast, Hawaiian food, breakfast basics). They should just stick to pancakes and spend the money they spend on spoiled fruit on real maple syrup and fresh squeezed juices.\n\nI give them one star for the staff. The second star is for the wait time for food."
1,"I spoke with and got quotes from 5 roofers before choosing Brown Roofing.  I could not ask for a better job.  We just bought this house and it needed a new roof.  It has tile which we used to think lasted forever.  The tiles do but the 'underlayment\"" which is under the tiles, does not.  After researching I found that some companies lay 1 layer of underlayment and some do 2, and 2 is better than 1. It should protect the roof from leaking for a longer period of time.  Two of the roof bids I received only had one layer so I did not want to use them.  After speaking with Craig Brown of Brown Roofing on the phone I found him to be extremely knowledgeable about roof replacement.  He explained how the roofing process works and, after our conversation,  I felt confident we would have a good outcome with Brown Roofing.   He sent an estimate after seeing the roof and it was very reasonable. We arranged a date for them to begin work and they were there as arranged.  They made sure the roof replacement was done in a quality manner in every regard.  They even threw in a lot of extras and did not charge! The roof looks so much better than it did and I am confident it will be watertight for many years.  They made sure everything was cleaned up everyday  when they left and also when they finished and the yard looks great.  One less thing to worry about.  It is great to work with a company that goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied."
1,"What can you say, best ice cream close to my home & always consistently good.  This location is great also because it's a rocky mountain chocolate too, which means you can get all your sugar in one location, ha ha. It's clean & service is always great too, what else can I say....its good."
1,"The only place I know of in Phoenix where you can get a fresh vegan breakfast, with new specials each week. I love the tofu scramble, sometimes they have a tofu and veggie breakfast burro which is absolutely to die for. The owner and staff are always very friendly and have always been happy to accommodate any special requests I've made."
0,"The waitress/owner is the worst I have ever experienced.  Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.\nI went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.\nShe went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  \nShe came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.\n\nI said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, \""Everyone is different,\"" so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.\n\nI asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  \""Excuse me?\"" I thought to myself, \""Does Orient equate with Chinese?\""\n\nI asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!\n\nFinally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, \""Alright already.\""  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, \""Check please!\"" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.\n\nI waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled \""Never again!\"" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.\n\nI had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before."
0,"How you like this hotel, depends on what part of the building you stay on. If you stay on the strip side I rate this place a 4 star Hotel. However, if you stay on the train track side, yes TRAIN TRACK side I rate this place 2 stars. \n\nThe first night I was on the train track side, meaning the tracks are visible within 40 feet of the hotel. Yes, what a dumbass Trump is for picking such a location, or at least not equipting it with sound proof windows. I heard the horn every hour or therabouts and could not sleep. The following morning I complained and received an upgrade to the strip side, and it was fabulous. Very spacious rooms, extra large bathroom, with walk in shower. The best thing about the hotel is the fact that it is smoke free. \n\nBut the train track side is an unbelievable oversight!"
0,"When I arrived I presened a photo of how I would like my toenails pedicured and painted. The lady said \"" ok. No problems we do dat for tou\""   I was under the impression that she spoke very little English. She began the pedi ... I kept reminding her what I wanted and showing her the photo of what I wanted.  She still didn't speak English.   The lady then said \"" hi Linda how are you. ..is your son walking yet?  \"" to a client that just walked in the door.    As my pedi continued my pedi lady said.   \"" oh I have special for you\"" because I requested rhinestone as the photo. Anyway I did not get what I paid for    the tech played the no english speaking game"
0,My past two haircuts with this location were horrible. First awful experience the lady left a long patch on the back of my head. Today I don't think she shaved the right side of the neck line. Two in a row so I will not go back a third time. Trying place across the street.
1,"Recently, I went to The Gold Guy store to ask about selling my old jewelry. I felt very comfortable when I walked in and after speaking to the person who worked there, I had no doubt that they were a reputable business.  I was offered a great price for my jewelry and agreed to the deal. I would happily recommend this company to anyone."
1,"The food is really good. There's a lot of variety and the desserts are the best in Vegas. Everyone comes for the seafood (located closes to the entrance). They have a variety of Mexican, Chinese, American, and Italian foods.\n\nIt is pretty pricy though. $50 per person for brunch on a Saturday. The lines tend to be long unless you're a Diamond or 7 Star member. Good thing about the price is that mimosas and champagne is included for brunch. \n\nThe service is on and off. Some servers were great but others would rudely bump into you without apologizing. \n\nI suggest you not let them seat you in the way back where the bigger groups are. The layout sucks so either you're right next to the food or in the far back corner away from everything."
1,"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere...99% of the time. The bar can get loud and obnoxious. If the bar is full, avoid it. The dining area is very nice. Order a cheese crisp and a beer. This place does Mexican comfort food right!"
0,"How about some meat with your cilantro stem tacos? jaysus, the green herb is seriously inexpensive; just the leaves will do.\n\nIn a 5 tiered rating system, and with hundreds of Mexican food choices in the valley, the stars begin to get blurry. The trouble is, certain dishes at Elmer's are just okay compared to others.\n\nRice? Great. Beans? Like El Sol down the street, several whole beans strewn about the refried puree for posterity; no thank you.\nTacos al pastor? Pass. Gristly pork and cardboard corn tortillas.\n\nSee my list for Mexican food recommendations."
0,"Watched Dita Von Tease at House of Blues. May 17th 2012 : The show started 20 minutes late, since it is standing room only tickets at $45-55 a pop and we had to arrive at least 30 minutes early so it is not very pleasant. A total of 50 minutes standing time and some audiences were sitting on the dirty floor... Once the show started it was disappointing and not worth the wait at all. What a waste of life and time this was! I didn't know a fat woman twirling nipple tassels is entertainment!? The MC told us the more we drank the better the show becomes and prettier the women too. I understand HOB started the show late so they can sell more drinks, but it is not fair to the audiences. Only thing nice about that place is the chandelier, I had the chance to stare at it for 50 minutes."
1,"I have been taking my vehicles to this location for years, and have been very happy with the service. I now have a fleet vehicle and was servicing it for the first time. I wasn't even clear on how to handle the billing  situation. Justin was incredibly helpful to me and called the fleet company and took care of it for me. I will definitely be taking the vehicle here for every synthetic oil change  and some repairs."
0,"Aweful!  After waiting for a very long time we received our appetizer and it wasn't even hot.  We told the server Cheyenne once we found her again. We told her we didn't want to push back our meal any longer because it was already taking to long. After a half hour we got our second appetizer and it was the same issue. At that point the manager came and told us it comes prepackaged and not fresh. They just fry it and add seasoning. We also told manager it was taking to long so he checked the kitchen and they hadn't even started our steaks yet.  Meanwhile, people around us are coming and going which led us to believe that our server Cheyenne was the problem with the timing.  She finally brought our salad about 2 minutes before our steak arrived. Once we received our food it was so salty!  We ask for a togo box 3 times before it came and once we put down the credit card it took another 20 minutes before she picked it up.  During this time she offered us another Coke but never brought it.  So the almost 2 hours to eat.  Prepackaged food. Salty food. Terrible server you can rest assured we will never go there again. Especially with Texas Roadhouse next door.  Fast service, good food and price is right."
1,"I found this place on YELP and was pleasantly surprised. I the menu is simple and straight forward. The entire place was clean and had a welcoming atmosphere. Our entire experience was met with great customer service, a friendly staff, very nice owner and the food was great. My wife had a salad with chicken and I had a cheesesteak with the steak. The portions were generous but not overwhelming to leave you feeling overfull. The flavor was great. Even though I live on the west side I would make the trip to enjoy the food again. I had the opportunity to speak with Victor, the owner. He was very accommodating and really nice to talk to you. I recommend Forefathers for a great meal at a relatively low price."
0,"The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back."
0,"I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly."
0,"This was not our first experience at Sensi. We were fans from almost the day it opened at Bellagio several years ago. We had some extraordinary meals there. Maybe it was an off night, but our latest experience wasn't anything close to the Sensi we remembered from not even a year ago.  \n\nAmbiance and decor is still outstanding . . . and one of the few places in the area that is not overwrought with 20-something women in stilettos and men in their saggy jeans. \n\nThere were ample items on the menu that sounded delicious, but in reality did not live up to our expectations. Unlike one of the previous posters, we found the Sensi Roll Call sampler almost too ambitious with a combination of flavors that left a sour aftertaste.  We also had the Sensi Original Noodle. While the combination of the various items reminded us of something along the line of a pad thai or chow fun type dish, it was actually heavily laden with cumin. Oh, how I wish the item description would have said so . . . cumin, while a great antioxidant, is one of my least favorite herbs . . . so disappointed.\n\nThe house-made naan bread was stellar . . . I could have eaten at least two bread baskets all by myself! The best part of the entire meal . . . \n\nUnfortunately, the less than stellar food along with the surly manner of our waiter made for a very lackluster culinary experience."
1,Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would: what is this place? A haven for craft-brew enthusiasts? A wanna-be bistro? Animal shelter activist headquarters? I don't bloody get it.\n1.) it took the waitress 20 minutes to shove two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 (4 adults and 4 small kids.) The restaurant wasn't busy, but the staff spent so much time drinking with the patrons they couldn't be bothered to do the necessary shoving. \n2.) the waitress took order, disappeared to drink and chat at the bar, came back about 40 mins later with food.\n3.) hubby ordered a burger, no complaints. Elder kiddo ordered fish and chips, and proceeded to eat only the fries (thin cut fast food fries, not \""chips\"".) The fish was slightly undercooked and overly greasy-- not sure how that was accomplished. It was served with what was supposed to be slaw, but was just red cabbage in an oily dressing. My kid never turns her nose up at any fish, but she didn't even touch it. \nI ordered the brats and mashed potatoes to share with my youngest kiddo-- the fresh veggie saut\u00e9 was excellent and the mashed potatoes with bacon were fantastic...at least the few bites that weren't drowned in an unpleasant, bitter onion-and-beer-based reduction. The brats were also doused in the powerfully bitter gravy, but no matter, since they were undercooked as well. A nice steak should be pink in the middle, a sausage should not be. Ick. I'd have complained to the waitress but she never reappeared....\n3.) ... In fact she hadn't come back by the time I left with the kids and my hubby stayed with my friend's hubby to try the horchata-orange beer the pub was unveiling that night. Who knows when she wandered back. \n4.) live music too loud at 6 pm.\n5.) hubby said that after my friend and I left with our respective kids, our table sat un-bussed for at least an hour. Some drink guy came up and asked if he could finish off my daughter's uneaten (and still uncleared away) plate of cold fish and chips, then helped himself... The horror. \n\nThis place made me think of where 40-ish post-hipsters go to drink away their remaining youth... Alcohol probably kills the salmonella from all the undercooked food, after all."
0,"Just not the same taste as the Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill. We always get the fried pork chop rice, but the one on Craig st is less crispy and the seasoning is a bit lacking. The rice is different too (sort of like a friend rice but not really), and instead of pickled cabbage and carrots, you get a mix of frozen/canned corn and peas or something. \n\nWill stick with the one in Squirrel Hill."
0,"I've been here a few times, it's ok in a pinch. The calzone was soggy on the bottom, so was the pizza crust. Usually I'll drive past it on my way to Spinato's, even Gus' down  the street has better food."
0,"I called this morning because my USB hard drive is not being recognize by my computer. I asked what it would cost to repair it. I was told to come down and they'd take a look at it. I took the morning off of work and drove 45 mins to their shop on Camelback Rd. I showed up and they didn't even look at it. They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . \n\nThey could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers, or Data Parcel Services. A**holes\n\nI found this program called Get Data Back, it costs $80, but I was able to recover all of the files I wanted from the USB drive. That sure beats $1199 these scoundrels wanted to charge me."
1,"Very flavorable  food. We went with another couple and we basically got 4 starters, 4 dinners & 3 deserts and shared it all. I feel like I got a good sample of a lot of items on the menu at once. Yes it was a lot of food but excellent."
1,"Definitely a five star dining experience. FOH staff very friendly and professional. Atmosphere is very cool an relaxing. After being greeting by the sommelier, you are taken on a tour of the seafood market, where you gives excellent choices different fish from around the world. \n\nWe chose: \nGrilled octopus appetizer - nice texture, good flavoring.\nSashimi Sampler- highlight of the entire meal, 3pcs of 4 diff fish.\nGreek Salad- veggies were very fresh.\nFish Entree- there were so many fish choices, that I actually forgot what we ordered; it was a buttery and seasoned perfectly.\nCanadian Lobster: chosen from the market, while still alive and moving, it was extremely fresh to say the least. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience, I look forward to my next visit."
0,"Technically speaking, this restaurant has everything a good restaurant in North Scottsdale should have: nice decor and ambiance, intriguing menu with lots to try, live music, and a good location.  After reading some stellar four and five star reviews on Yelp, we were pretty excited to try it out for dinner, however we found ourselves leaving sorely disappointed with both the food and the service.  \n\nMistake #1:  Not a big crowd on a Friday night. Granted we did arrive a little later than the normal dinner crowd (8ish), but there were very few people eating here which was a little disconcerting.\n\nMistake #2:  Had to wait over half an hour just to order, even though the place was empty.  Our waiter apparently decided to go on a smoke break (and we're not talking cigarettes here people) right when we sat down.  This left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girls why we weren't being served.  They apologized profusely and got our waiter out to our table in a few minutes. \n\nMistake #3:  The food was not that great.  We ordered two small pizzas, two appetizers (baby back ribs and stuffed bell pepper) and pork tenderloin cooked to medium.  The pizza's both were cold and tasted like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a little on the tough side, definitely not cooked medium.  The appetizers were okay, but for all the food that we got, we both left ready to snack when we got home since we didn't finish our less than spectacular meal.\n\nI will say that the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant, but those are about the only redeeming qualities I can find in this restaurant.  We will surely not go back to Javino's for the simple fact that there are an abundance of restaurants in Scottsdale alone that offer the whole package in the dining experience without compromising the service or the quality of food.  Nice try though.... \n\n2.5/5."

1,"I'm biased for this place. Trash talk this Chinese bakery to me and I will cut you. I love their coconut butterfly rolls, and the raisin stick is my BFF. my brother orders the bbq steamed buns, and bbq pork buns off the shelf. My mom likes her custard stick, and my sister just eats whatever's leftover in the 40.00 bag of goodies we bring home every time we make the trek to Chinatown. \n\nI love you, diamond bakery... marry me?"
1,"Th Hub is for me a focal point especially when the Edinburgh Festival is in full flow either for aquiring tickets, making show enquiries, information on events or a quick lunch bite. It also doubles as an event venue, and has private meeting room upstairs, in this structure that dominates the city skyline...but for me I have yet to fully experience a show or some food here.\n\nFor me the its location is fairly central in an converted church, now a regional meeting place where its quiet enough to escape the hussle and bussle of outside, during busy tourist season!  Enjoy the shop, free maps and guides, chatting to Hub staff finding out if there are any tickets left for usual sold out events that Edinburgh is famous for, and the afternoon weekend teas are great as well as weddings and pre-tattoo suppers.\n\nThey have wifi, not sure if it is free but according to the ticket staff, you cant get access to www from the shop area but possibly need a password from the restaurant staff. \n\nFor full information visit the hub website www.thehub-edinburgh.com"
1,"A while ago, I had been to a few other Del Frisco's around the country, but this go around stands out in my mind.  Before I had never thought of Del Friscos as being better than any other upscale steakhouse, but this time I had pretty much the best filet.  It was perfectly charred and the medium rare, was actually medium rare.  Even the asparagus was perfect, not a single one being mushy.  \n\nI was slightly disappointed by the upcharge for the wine.. our bottle of the Frog's Leap cab was $100.. yea exactly.  Thankfully the staff was nice enough to deal with our slightly rowdy and inappropriately dressed table.  They overlooked the fact that I was wearing shorts (I had no idea we were going here.. thus the lack of appropriate dress).\n\nI never thought I'd do this, but 5 stars for the best filet I've had in recent memory."
1,"This food was seriously delicious. I hate to say it but i am seriously \""craving\"" one of their bowls right now. The flavors are well done and their products are fresh. If you want a healthy and delicious meal, you need to here. They have tons of gluten free options, vegetarian and vegan dishes for all of your dietary needs. Head on over!"
1,"Great selection of quality dog and cat foods, treats, toys, and everything in between! \n\nThe staff is incredibly helpful, almost too helpful if that is possible! :) A friendly greeting is always offered when you walk in the door and they are always able to make great recommendations on food and toys. When using the self dog-wash center, the staff was available to lend tips and make sure everything is running smoothly. \n\nI love the healthy and natural foods they offer - a striking contrast to chain pet stores - and their prices are very competitive. They have an impressive collection of dog toys, although the cat selection is slightly limited, and the toys are in the higher value range (a problem when you have a dog that instantly destroys any toy you bring home, no matter how strong it is!). \n\nThey have two very chilled out cats that are lounging around the store. They are usually hanging out on the counter or a raised cat house, but just be aware of you have a cat chasing dog. \n\nP.S. I love their frequent customer deals - after you buy multiple bags of food you receive one free!"
0,"Went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews... We were disappointed to say the least. Soggy chimichanga, mushy rice, bland machaca and chicken, chips that tasted like supermarket chips, and mediocre salsa."
0,"Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \""Nails you Hate\"""
1,"The lunch buffet is a great value. For ~$13 a person, you'll get unlimited tacos, chimichangas, enchiladas, tostadas, salads, and soft drinks. The horchata is recommended and is included in the lunch buffet. Try it! It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste. I'm used to a more syrup-like consistency. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend to others. When I return, I'd like to try a margarita since they're known for having made the largest margarita in the world!"
0,"Wow, this is just bad food, even for a chain. Went there for lunch because a client wanted to try it, and the only good thing was he paid for it because he felt bad for suggesting it. \n\nThe ribs were dry and stringy, and the pulled pork was not much better. The service was on par with the food - you'd think that once a restaurant managed to get you to try their place, they would at least make a reasonable effort to give you decent service, and lose the surly attitude."
1,I just want to give a HUGE thank you!!!! This place by far exceeded my expectations!!!! You guys are all so great and you truly do stay true to your words. I will definitely be coming here from now on. \nHands down the best place to go
1,"This place has amazing burgers, the best onion rings and fries in Charlotte.  If your after a burger check this place out. You won't be disappointed."

0,"I'd been to their sister branch in Oakland, liked it a lot, and was thrilled that there was an Oh Yogurt in my very own neighborhood. However, they could not be more different. This one does not offer free samples, which normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, but we'll get to that. Their toppings, especially fruit, looked old...like...very old when I came in on a Wednesday afternoon. I would not pay 41 cents per ounce for them, that's for sure. \n\nI filled my cup with my usual favorite flavors - raspberry, peach, banana and, my all time favorite, TART. I paid, and dug into the tart....to find that it was actually vanilla. I really don't like vanilla flavored anything. When I brought this to the attention of the management, they told me I must be mistaken. This turned into a whole to-do, which culminated in them pouring half my yogurt into the trash (after I'd paid) and telling me to just refill a cup. No refund, no apology...\n\nAnd their flavors didn't taste that great either. Sadly, I won't be returning."
0,"I had a terrible experience. I stood and watched the host take three couples to their tables AFTER we arrived and they didn't have reservations. Once seated, we were promised warm bread from the oven that never materialized. I had a shrimp linguine dish that had only 5 small shrimp and the entire dish was dry. And noone ever came to refill our water or even came by to see if we wanted more water. It was horrible and I will likely not return.  It's too bad because the place came with such high recommendations."
1,Wonderful place to eat dinner in Vegas!!!  We had a delightful dinner here with live music in the background.  We had to wait to get seated but totally worth it!  Very enjoyable meal.
0,"Yes,  two stars.\nI felt compelled to write this review for the fact that it was just a bad experience overall. I eat out, alot. I frequent new and old establishments.\nI eat mom and pop all the way to joel robuchon.\nI give everyone a fair chance, and probably me being in the industry is not going to help this review at all, however...\n\nUpon entering Firefly last night, there was no greeter for 4 minutes in a small lobby area that had no one present but myself and my girlfriend.\nWhen the hostess finally sat us, we waited 10 minutes before anyone remotely attended to us. When that person came, it was for bread on the table. Then....the wait, another 10 minutes and still no service,even for drinks.\nWhen my girlfriend spoke up, it was to another server who took our drink order AND our tapas selections. He told us, this was not his section, however..he put the order in and informed us that our \""server\"" would be taking us through the remainder of our meal.\nWe Thanked him and soon after, our plates arrived, rather quickly I might add.\nI must say, I am glad we only ordered 5 plates. Everything was either a fried element or had some sort of fried item in the food. \nAt best, it was \""ok\"". \n\nThe Thai beef Salad tasted boring. No real essence of Thai at all. The beef almost tasted poached with no char,which could be from the over saturation of dressing. The dressing itself needed something to balance the acidity,perhaps a sweetness [which I am assuming was the purpose of the pickled ginger, is that even really \""Thai\""]\nAnd the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much.\n\nThe empanada ..all I can say is Shame On You! Creme Cheese? Really?\n\nThe duck rolls were constructed as if it were rillette , almost a puree.\nIf, and I do stress, it was supposed to be that way, I would suggest learning to confit.\n\nThe croquette seemed like fried potato soup with cheese. No real evidence of any ham whatsoever.\n\nAbout the only thing really \""decent\"" was the tempura. Sauce was nice and not to overpowering with citrus segments in it. However, the green onions were left to soak in the grease for way to long and almost tasted burnt.\n\nAll the while of eating, I noticed the heavier set man who I am assuming is the FOH manager roaming. He spent most of his time however at a table, picking up a child and speaking to one table and that table alone. Not realizing what his staff is doing.\n\nNow, back to the lack of service. Our waiter who \""should\"" have been giving us service in the first place finally arrived at plate number 4.\nHe saw that most of the plates were left un eaten and suggested that he \""pack\"" the food up in a to go box. We declined. He never asked us how our meal was or even why there was an abundance of food left.\nYou would think someone would get 2 + 2.\n\nIt was also a little strange that when the \""original\"" order taker asked if my girlfriend wanted a refill on her drink and the busboy delivered it, he prepared to take my beer away in replace,yet, my girlfriends glass was empty [ o , did I mention that I never received the option for a beer glass and just received a bottle], then..the bussboy brought another drink to the table after that. Two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered. At this point, I was at my limit.\n\nThere are smaller points I could make, but I believe I am getting my point across. \nFirefly, this is my second visit. I wont be returning for a long long long time, if ever."
1,"Just moved here from Michigan a great find from my home state. Great people, great food, and great weather what else can you ask for???"
1,"Adding to what the girls have outlined, I can't help but wonder why this shop is open all year round.\n\nSaying that, it has its uses - it keeps visitors and locals up to speed on upcoming Fringe events, and nearer the time (i.e from June onward) you can buy tickets for various shows to guarantee your front row seat.\n\nIt sells some Fringe merch, which seems a bit empty unless you are actually at the Fringe that year and want something to remember it by. But I can imagine some tourists being interested in the t shirts and teddies they have on offer.\n\nLike Eleanor, I find the Fringe Shop's year long opening a little bit pointless. But if I need to use it nearer the time of the festival, which I sometimes do, I am usually caught saying the opposite. So I'm four starring it since it's a great resource of information if you're wanting to secure your place in or at the Fringe early!"
1,"Came for dinner before a 9:30 show at the Mirage. We were seated at 6:30. Our drinks were a little slow, arriving after our meatball. I had asked the meatball to be brought at the same time as our entrees but, it was brought as an appetizer. It was so freaking delicious, I didn't even care. I will return a hundred times for the meatball if not for anything else. The complimentary bread & sauce was very good. I ordered spaghetti with tomato & basil and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband ordered chicken mushroom ravioli. Not so great. It had an odd brown gel-like sauce. It was not at all what my husband was expecting and it was a really small portion. He ordered an extra order of the bread ($6) because he wasn't full. Our service was ok. Drinks went empty and never were refilled, so we drank water. The GM came around and was very nice. Even more so when we told him we were locals. Then we ordered dessert and it took 30+ minutes for it to arrive. We had to pick up our show tickets 1 hour before the show and we barely made it! The waiter was apologetic about the long wait & finally offered to refill our drinks at that point. The zeppole Oreos were delicious, just not sure why it took so long. Had we not had the show to get to, I would not have minded as the people watching was fabulous. Overall the giant Meatball was the star of this dinner. Can't wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy the patio seating. A little expensive ($125w/tip) for a pasta dinner, but it wasn't shocking. It was expected."
0,"this is gonna be a long one...so sit back and relax....I come from a VERY big Sicilian family (12 people) so when we  order we normally order big. were are originally from philly and we have owned pizzerias my entire life...so needless to say we are pretty picky about our pizza. we have been searching a long time for some good pizza so we were pretty relieved once we came here....\n\nwere the type of people to give a three strikes and your out deal...well this place has hit their third strike with me/us\n\nfirst time I ordered was about a month ago...I got a large ham/bacon pizza. after the wait of an hour and a half (I live 1.7 miles down the st) for delivery....we got our pizza and the bacon was ALL fat...it was disgusting looking but we just took the bacon off and moved on....I figured I give it another shot....\n\nso yesterday I get there at 6:37 pm ordered 16 inch specialty pizza and a 14in half pepperoni and asked for a 2 liter....my total came to 40$. 40 for two pizzas is RIDICULOUS!!! like I said were from philly..were from a big city n we charged 10.99 for an 18 inch cheese!! so then I pull a 50$ bill out n im told I have to walk to the smiths next door and get change cause they don't take anything bigger then 20 cause they been screwed with fake money...(if your pricing food the way u r....going to walmart and spending 7$ on a bill marker been should NOT  an issue for u) either way that is not my problem.... so for me to walk all the way over there to break money is not only ridiculous, its very rude!!!! your pretty much telling me u don't trust my money and that u and your entire staff are to lazy to walk over for the customer to do this for them..since its YOUR rule....I mean u had 6/7 people there last night...not one person could b the runner for your customers??? that actually might have gotten you bonus points with some people (me) anyways....since  I walked all the way over the store to break my change...I figured why spend 3 dollars on 1 two liter when I can get 2 for 3$ here!!! so u actually screwed yourself on that one...\n\nat 7:47 pm I FINALLY walked out with my pizzas....AN HOUR LATER FOR A PICK UP!!!!!!!! I stood there and watched a little...cause like I said I no what im doing in a pizzeria...I watched your pizza guy mess up atleast 4 orders...u guys were busy and people were moving SO SLOW!!!! chatting around....ridiculous! and the lady in the front with the cigarette voice REALLY needs some more training.\n\nI watched another couple come in order food and beers...the women who took there order (cigarette voice lady) asked. \""oh y didn't u get a bucket? its cheaper.\"" ummmmm probably cause they don't work there and u didn't tell them MORON!!! \n\nthe shenanigans I watched for over an hour was just unreal and we will not be back...which is a shame cause the food aint to bad at all....just goes to show u its more then just what the food taste like.\n\nim sure once this is read they will no exactly who this is just because of the two liter statement. which is fine...I hope you enjoy your last 40 from me :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin response to the owner****\nnumber one yes bacon is fatty. but if u or ur staff knew anything...ud no to avoid disgusting looking bacon u either A. order Bacon bits from ur distributor or ur chop up ur own throw in a the deep fryer that was it looks presentable  unlike the slop ur business allowed to go out the door. into my home. number 2 yes u do have ONE SIGN at the front door about the 20$$ bill thing but go buy a pen so u don't look like a rude lazy owner. like I said I grew up in a pizzeria...I no what food cost is...we also used quality product...alot like ur products...i never once said u didnt have quality product...ur just straight up over charging. and ur right I have no other yelp post or friends cuz I specifically made this one just to tell people about ur business. I said what I needed to say...n im sure ur business will eventually downward spiral in the future. have a great day.\n\nfyi- arguing with me REALLY doesn't make u or ur business look any better."
1,"I am from Seattle. I always support the local coffeehouse. Bergies is the best coffee in the Phoenix metro area. Ive been to all the other coffee houses in the area. The quality of their coffee is very high. I know that i do not need to go home to enjoy great coffee. I hope everyone supports Bergies and does not go to the worst coffee ever, Starbucks. They not only sold my Sonics (yes i take it personally), they also serve bitter, bad coffee. Go to Bergies, and you will be satisfied."
0,"We stopped here on the way to the airport and it was pretty lame!  It was HH without a bartender - WTF? Our server was slow as a snail and got yelled at by the manager.  Also, he forgot our drinks.  And our sushi sat at the bar foreeevvverrrr before he picked it up.\n\nOur rolls had too much sauce on it and weren't cut all the way through.  UGH."
1,"Stopped in for some emergency supplies. (Emergency as in there was only butter in my fridge and I had one roll of toilet paper.) The employees were lovely as always, colorful, fresh fruit and vegetables greeted me and I scored in the free coffee & food that was available to sample. Trader Joe's never fails to delight and, of course, I purchased more beer and wine that is humanly necessary. Trader Joe's doesn't need a review. Of course a visit here is wonderful. This is a definite favorite of mine!"
0,"Did not care for Miracle Mile shops at all...the least exciting of the Strip shops - selection is that of a regular mall, no labels you couldn't find elsewhere. The sole redemption of Miracle Mile shops might be Sephora for last-minute needs. Don't  care for the crowd here - can be sketch."
0,"I have in what this city is known as M-Power with SRP. This is the closest location most near to my home. I normally shop at Frys or Wal- Mart neighborhood market. My reason for not shopping at a store I go to regularly to purchase power???? LINES, Lines,and more Lines. With no self check out machines and 11 people standing in line on a regular day to day basis; I simply dont shop here anymore. \n  Considering the neighborhoods to the West, North, and East are mostly middle to upper middle class. I have no idea why this has such a high crime element hanging around. The panhandling and shoplifting are more common at this location than not.  One thing that may help is not having a dark parking lot. The Parking lot in front of the store is so dark. I will not come here after dark. I hope this review will come to the attention to some corporate big wig that can meet with the property management of this location and clean up the integrity of the Safeway Brand."
0,Editing my review from 5/5 to 2/5. Was my second experience at Layla's and everything was great including the food and vibe. The service was a little slow when it got busy so that's to be expected and not a big deal. \n\nThe reason for my edit on this review is because I woke up this morning throwing up the food I ordered(Shawarma plate). Could be an isolated incident but after the whole Firefly thing you never know.
0,Not impressed! The food all looks old would rather spend a couple extra dollars for fresh stuff!
1,"I'm still dreaming about Sunday bottomless mimosas. Sadly, we were on our way to deliver a wedding cake so we didn't have time to enjoy them. Next time!\n\nI wanted to try something new but I just kept thinking about the pastrami melt with avocado. It's on garlic bread and the bread actually has real chunks of roasted garlic. Delish!  They are super super generous with their avocado portions, which I love. I had my 22 month old daughter with me, so I took half the avocado off for her snack and it as still enough. \n\nHubby got the pig (?) not sure on name. He said it was so yummy. I would've tried it but I'm a weirdo that always goes no mayo, no mustard, no sour cream, no white creamy sauce etc. I wanted to try it though but he loves mayo. \n\nFunny story, my previous review was very good (4 stars) but I did mention they forgot to put chips in the to go bag. The girl at the counter must've seen my pic or remembered us (our kid is pretty cute, ha!!) and took care of our chips this time. A little embarrassing, but I so do appreciate the attention to detail in yelp reviews, as I'm the same was a a biz owner. \n\nSide note, we live in Mountain's Edge, so we actually travel all the way here. Will be back for those darn mimosas!  One Sunday soon!\n\nFunny at"
0,"UA Theaters have had it! Why do they keep this place open? Its run down, out of date and well, architecturally ugly! Oh yeah, this is the place that looks just like Space Mountain at Disneyland.. though the only thrill you'll get from here is when they finally bulldoze it down! \n\nThey really should put a Harkin's there where there outta be one!"

0,"Okay, this is my second time at the Buffet. The first time I was really impressed, the food was delicious and there was such a big variety. And the dessert buffet! The best. \nSo i decided to come back 3 weeks later with my family. It was a Wednesday night, there wasn't a big line and not top busy. \nThe food was again delicious, but the service was the worst. We were 3 adults and a kid and had ordered drinks for 3 adults, but it seemed like after 2 drinks it was a problem giving them to us. Our waitress seemed more and more angry and did not smile or talk back when we asked her to bring drinks. After 1.45 hours she said that we couldn't get more drinks and had to go. WHAT. Okay, on the receipt it says that they would like if people would stay no longer than 2 hours, but we just asked for a last drink. Well, she came back and said you can get a last one. And then in one of the drinks there were bugs in the ice cubes. BUGS. So gross. We talked to the manager and she apologized and we got the money back for 1 unlimited drinks (around $13). \n\nI am never coming back, good food, but that can never make up for the bad bad service, and BUGS in the ice cubes. EWW"

This place is no exception.\n\nI don't know if I've had a bad dish here.  The selection is large if you know what to order.  Many items are not on the American menu.  The live seafood is awesome and it is cooked to perfection however way you please.  We have also ordered a whole roasted sucking pig here on several occasions for the holidays."
0,"you get what you pay for.\n\nmy daughter is allergic to my cats so when she comes into town, i put her up at nice hotels.  on her last day in town, she checked out of her hotel, and we spent the day at the breathtaking Valley of Fire, hiking in 100 degree weather.  needless to say, we were exhausted when i drove her back to her car in the hotel's parking lot.  i didn't want her driving at night when she was so tired, and went on the internet to quickly find some place for her to stay at the last minute that wouldn't stretch my already overspent budget for her stay in vegas..\n\nthe riviera came up and the price was very cheap.  i made an online reservation and we drove there.\n\nthe valet was very nice and when he saw i was on portable oxygen, he said he would park the car close by so i wouldn't have to wait long when i finished checking her in.  that was pretty nice!\n\nwe went to the lobby and we were both impressed by the huge chandelier in the lobby.  very pretty.  there was a VERY loooong line to check in, so i thought this place must be great, to be so crowded!  my daughter stood in line with me for a while, but she was so tired, i told her to go sit down on the couch and she did.  i had left my oxygen in the car, thinking i would be right back out.  bad idea.  i was in line for over an hour, exhausted, watching my daughter practically falling asleep on the couch.\n\nafter an hour, i finally got up to the desk.  the check in lady was actually very sweet and very personable and helpful.  i asked her to please give my daughter a view of the strip and she said no problem.\n\nwe got the room key and made our way to the room.  it seemed like forever to walk down hallway after hallway, get to the elevator, and get up to her floor and into her room.  \n\ni was not very happy with the room.  it looked outdated and i wasn't  too sure about the cleanliness because the lamp was pretty dim, but the bathroom light was bright and it looked clean.  i went to the window and looked out, and the \""strip view\"" i requested was a joke.  there were plenty of rooms that would have offered a REAL strip view and i would have gladly paid more for that if given the choice.  but i wasn't about to go downstairs and wait another hour so i was going to call the front desk when my daughter said not to worry about it.\n\nthere were excellent drink specials in the bar which was really great.  i mean really really inexpensive, surprising for being on the strip.  however she really wanted to use the pool to relax before going to bed but it was closed.  it was only about  9 pm.  i was really surprised they closed the pool so early.  so much for getting any of the 'resort\"" that we paid a \""resort fee\"" for.\n\nmy daughter said she slept well and the bed was OK.  after hiking all day in 100 degree temps, i think any bed would have felt good!\n\nbut as i said, you get what you pay for.  it was one of the cheapest rooms in the city that night, and it kept my daughter from having to drive when she was too tired to drive, so it suited its purpose.  when i got back to the valet stand about an hour and a half later, the valet was true to his word, remembered my first name and his promise, and got my car to me extremely fast."
1,"I love pizza and Joe's New York Pizza sure delivered what I expected. The spinach ricotta pizza was delicious. The chunks of ricotta was just enough and the spinach had flavor. I also ordered buffalo wings. Although there were more drummettes than wings, it was still good. The only reason why I gave 4 stars vs 5 is because I also ordered their garlic knots which were not that great. They fill the knots with pesto which was extremely oily and sickening. I wish I passed on the knots and just stuck with the pizza."
0,"Mario Batali....what have you done?  I'm your biggest fan of Osteria Mozza in LA and was expecting Mozza quality and deliciousness at Carnevino.  With the quality of a Sizzler and the service of Olive Garden (actually although I hate their food, the service is even better), I am taking some of my \""I'm your foodie groupie\"" points away big time!!  That's what happens when these great restaurant owners grow too quickly.  Service and quality goes way down.  :(  \n\nChris was our first waiter, but then we got stuck with Goose.  Rude, sarcastic, made racist jokes, just unbelievable.  Maybe he should have been stuffed and served on a platter instead of serving customers.  I can't imagine a guy like that making it at Macaroni Grill, let alone a Mario Batali restaurant.  \n\nOk, on to the food.  The steak tartare was decent, but it went down from there.  I ordered the lamb chops as my entree.  As many others said, they WAY undercook things.  I asked for medium rare, but the meat was oozing with blood!  Yuck!  And it was at least 75% fat.  Fortunately, Chris came to the rescue when he sent it back to the kitchen for me and took it off the bill.  I had ordered the brussel spouts as a side.  They were mediocre at best.  Needless to say, I skipped on the dessert.  Mr. Batali...please, don't ruin the image I've had of you.  Keep a few restaurants that you can manage and consistently deliver Mozza quality.  Otherwise, you will be boxed in with the Outback Steakhouse & Olive Garden.  Fortunately, Osteria Mozza is still 5 stars in my book."
0,"Not the best place to go, but not the worse. The music was on point throughout the night, nothing but the latest in Hip-Hop and House music. The bartenders by the main dance floor sucked, but the the others in the side-room were awesome! If your looking for somewhere to get your grind on, def put this on your list. But make sure to uncheck service and cleanliness."
1,"WHAT THE F**K DOES \""UNIDENTIFIED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA\"" MEAN???!!! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE F**KING BAGGING AREA!!\n\nExcept the bag of course, but it's stil no excuse.\n\nRegular bouts of teeth grinding, fist clenching rage aside, this store isn't too bad, but is significantly smaller than the Tesco Express which is at most a 3 minute walk away. Convenient, but pointless if you'rre equidistant, or closer to, it's larger sibling."

1,"big Ethiopian sized portions .. Your best bet is take a fellow heat seeker and get a combo plate , we had fish , chicken and veggies combo.. The veg was mostly lentils with a handful of lettuce salad but hit the spot. They also have a few bottle beers and that Honey Wine that they are famous for. Moderately priced I'll be back whenever I visit Charlotte. I live in Atlanta but to me this type of food is missing in Charlotte bcz I didnt see many foreigners around town. Don't go if you don't eat hot food but if you haven't had this type of cuisine the waitress seemed more than willing to explain what the dishes are .. And oh, don't expect fork and knife , the food is eaten with Injeera, ethiopian bread that resembles a sponge. It has a sour tastes from being fermented."
1,"Far too amazing to disappear so quickly.  Sadly it was just announced that the Chicago-based Francesca's Restaurants, Inc., which owns the Scottsdale location  decided to shut the doors after a very short run here in the Valley.  What a huge loss  as this place was a truly great dining experience with an ambiance and menu worth experiencing over and over.  Head Chef Peter DeRuvo had once again unleashed his culinary magic and served up some of the most creative and utterly delicious Italian fare I've seen in quite some time here in the Valley - just read through the other reviews if you are a glutton for punishment and you'll quickly discover what you missed."
1,"If grandma comes to town and tells you a place reminds HER of Key West, you know it's legit.  But I didn't need that sort of confirmation.\n\nAt first I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything other than the bananas foster french toast (and trust me, someone at your table NEEDS to get this dish - don't worry, the full size order is way more than enough to share).  But then, one day, I tried something else - the Local Breeze Omlet... whoa!  Scrambled eggs, Proscuitto, Goat Cheese, Asparagus, Tomato, Basil galore.\n\nIn the mood for lunch?  Just go for anything on the menu.  Salads, burgers, sandwiches... just point to something and you'll be pleased no matter what.\n\nBut the best suggestion I can give on this place is go for the weekend brunch.  You'll be glad you did.  And I feel obligated to share this secret, since I just learned of it this weekend myself...  Rocky Point eggs (trust me on this one).\n\nFull disclosure: they stop serving breakfast foods around 11am.  DO NOT MISS THIS DEADLINE!  Also, although good, I would skip the sangria (and don't expect an $8 value out of your $8 mimosa).\n\nBe sure to check out the bathroom before you go (go before you go?), it's pretty cool, like the rest of the place.  And, 10% discount if you ride your bike on the weekends.  Are you heading to Local Breeze yet?"
0,"$40 for a cup of Gumbo, Jambalaya, a Pepsi, and tip. Very, very spicy, to the point of overwhelming any flavor. Jambalaya was a bit salty and greasy, with dried out chicken, definitely not worth $23. I won't be rushing back any time soon."
1,"I ordered and bought a cake here for a birthday party. The cake was delicious but the blue icing stained all of our lips and teeth. It was a good $25 cake though. They spelled surprise wrong as \""surprice\"". But we didn't complain because we were on a timeline. The people inside shopping were slightly shady. Seems like a decent grocery store though if you just want the basics and nothing too fancy. They came through on the cake so it's all good."
1,"I've found myself having a swift couple in here on a number of occasions, despite it not really being near any other nightlife, and the fact I've never lived anywhere nearby. I'm not sure the reason behind it's seemingly magnetic appeal, it's just a regular locals pub. Reasonable prices, busy for sports, with the usual pub grub and middle aged decor.\n\nIt almost, but not quite, loses a star due to the regular presence of rugby fans. This shower are the main reason I've never chose to permanently locate in Edinburgh, and their presence in The Haymarket is the reason why (on certain days), I'd choose not to locate in this pub."
0,"I wish I could say more good things about this place but I was very disappointed.  Okay, the girls are pretty and there is a lot of TV's.  That's it.  The food is overpriced and not very good.  Same for the drinks.  Afterwards, my friends and I wished I went somewhere else.  Definitely over rated.  Hooter's would of been a better idea, lol.\nThe one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that I befriended that day.  He was a childhood friend of one of my buddies.  He ended up picking up the check which was over $200.  Thanks Dave."
1,"The bar tenders are always super nice and friendly. I've eaten at this location about ten times, and the food is yum. However, I feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food. I usually eat in the restaurant, but the one time I ordered curb side to-go, they messed my order up."
1,"When did libraries get so hi-tech? I don't even need to go to the librarian/assistants to get my books checked any more? I just put them on this little ledge and it lets me know when I need to bring it back? That is AWESOME.\n\nI popped in for a few quick read books as sometimes I don't want to spend a week or so one the one story and need something quick. The librarian was more than happy to give me a guided tour of how the library worked. With the way she was talking, the technology they are using now has been going for the last 3 or 4 years so I did feel a little silly.\n\nModern and very well laid out and also has groups for children, teenagers and a book club for adults that runs twice a month (Group A and Group B, they aren't expecting you to read that quickly all the time)\n\nIdeal place to come and read the papers if you don't plan on spending what is the small fortune to read the news too! I fell in love with libraries when I was a child and with the way they are going now, I think I have fallen in love again although I'm still trying to work out how xbox's and Playstation's are educational..\n\nLovely library with lovely staff, proud to have this as my local library."
1,"I must give it up for Wolfman. As a former resident of California, their pizza is no more \""California\"" than is Taco Bell, but I imagine they're going for the comparison to California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nWe love the White Wolf. I also enjoy the pizza with the chicken, spinach and fine herbs. The crusts walk that line between thick and thin very well. I know that folks have crust preferences (NY style, Chicago style, etc), but this might be a crust which embraces all pizza eaters.\n\nThe appetizers are great for handling a very hungry table anxiously waiting for the pizza, though not really all that memorable. \n\nThe individual-sized salads are really enough for two to split, and the large size could serve three or more. If it is just the two of you, ask for the individual size and an extra plate, along with the dressing on the side (they often have a pretty heavy hand with the dressing).\n\nNIce folks serving, though the speed of delivery of the food can vary with no discernible reason (e.g., restaurant not really busy, off-peak time, etc). Good selection of beers, and some nightly specials (check their website for details of that night's deal). Seating available outside, which can be a nice touch on a good evening."
0,"Two words: Hell. No.\n\nI have never been to an El Pollo Loco, but I've heard good things, so I went to this location to check it out last night. I ordered the kids pollo bowl with tortilla chips, which is essentially rice, beans, and chunks of chicken.  As soon as I took the lid off, I knew something was wrong.  Was it supposed to be a soup? Because my bowl was SWIMMING in liquid.  I assume that it is from the container they keep the beans in, but it's like they didn't even bother to drain the liquid before they threw the beans in there, and now my bowl is more than half-full of bean water.  The tortilla chips were on par with Taco Bell.  \n\nI might go back to try their chicken on the bone, but never again will I order a bowl from this place.  Gross."
0,"The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar??), compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations. Big disappointment. This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town. I had the white sands chimi which has always been good, but there was no pork to the chili. Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the \""yucky tortilla and spicy beans\"", we were out."
1,Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.
1,Delicious.  Great vibe and ambiance. I recommend the outdoor area in the back
1,"I love this place, the custard is always cold and delicious. I love the smell of freshly cooked waffle cone.  I love the atmosphere music the decor on the wall it really takes you back to more wholesome time.  So another Saturday another custard Run."
1,"Phenomenal. Great service, great food, good price. No idea how they get chicken to taste that good."
1,"wow!! beautiful, spectacular., love it .As we walk in a friendly check in service, got a beautiful one bedroom apartment with terrace,spectacular view towards  Bellagio .really high tech,very specious .All the Valle people very nice.Our bell person Lydia Moreno  very nice friendly informative show us around.\ni did my hair at the salon by Andeen she was very nice friendly and done a good job for my bridal hair. \n the pool was,t what i expect.it,s not that deep or big.the one by the strip the closing hour said 11 but at 10.45 when i was try to visit to try to take some picture and try to walk around a very rude young man ask me multiple times to leave and tell me his boos order him to do that.i ask to spik to the manager he toll me to find him some were out.and the second back up a security guy is coming.that ruin my night.the second day i call to speak to the manager in charge Eddie Feliciano,they told me he was,t available and he never try to return my phone as i ask.I want. to be clear why it say closing ours at 11 but they told me on the phone 8,with out any specifications.\nwe spend weekend also there. the atmosphere because of the club was very a life ,elegant and a lot of sexy girls.\nwe request our room to be touch up for the day were we have photos taking  for our weeding day in the gorges room and  it took about an hour.. we barely made it .\nBut over all I love it I enjoy my vacation we definitely  gone came back there.And if the pool manager would call back to clear the closing hours would get 5 stars from me."
0,After a long day of moving boxes out of my house into a storage I was exhausted by the time I arrived to Home Depot. I needed a u-haul truck to transport the remainder of items out my house which btw I needed to have out the house that day. I go to customer service and speak with one lady about renting a truck overnight. First she said that she didn't think they did overnight renting and it was almost closing time so I wouldn't be able to get one that day for the use of same day. She was uncertain whether they did overnight because of some recent things that had occurred. She spoke with the Assistant manager over the phone who told her that she could go ahead and rent me an overnight vehicle. I went back to my car to let my boyfriend know what was going on. As I returned into the store the lady I had been dealing with sent me over to another cashier to take care of this. This new lady has no clue about what I needed assistance with and has to ask the lady who sent me to her. While they are talking things over they then start doubting whether it will be okay to rent me the van and the new lady calls someone ( the assistant manager ) who comes to front right away and now says they will not be renting me the vehicle for overnight due to a recent situation that happen with one of the vehicles. I got really pissed off because the assistant manager switched up his decision and I had waisted valuable time there walking away without a truck. It basically was up to the assistant manager to decide if he wanted to allow a truck being rented for overnight. When the first cashier called him he should not have told her it was okay to rent me the truck for overnight. That particular location will never get my business again. They were all a bunch of.... Never mind i'll be nice. Located off serene and eastern.
1,"Called these folks after my drivers side window was smashed in by a thief. The staff was understanding and sympathetic to the situation. They went out of their way to ensure that I got the best service. The tech was on time, and completed the task efficiently, most importantly he had the right tools, he had my car door carefully disassembled, then vacuumed the door, mats and cleared all the broken glass from the window channels. 45 min later the new window was in and I was back on the road in no time... thanks Secure Auto Glass and thank you Ash.."
1,"Stayed at the Signature this past weekend so we went to Delights for a post night of drinking meal, and it was good. \n\nI got the Las Vegas Blvd sandwich ( I think that's the one I got) it was a sandwich with Skirt steak, fried egg, caramelized onions, and a sauce. It was so good, my only real complaint is the proportions are kind of small and it's a bit pricey. \n\nI paid $12 for a sandwich but it was a really good sandwich so no real complaints."
1,"I have to admit I'm not an authority on nail or pedicure salons but recently my step daughter got me hooked on getting a pedicure. I have been looking for a place close to my home and saw some Grand Opening signs for a place not far from me and decided to visit this past Sunday, 1/13/2013. I was not at all dissapointed with the lovely time I had at MiMis Nails and Spa. \n\nThey are located in a large plaza on the corner of Elliot and Alma School roads and are easy to locate. There was plenty of parking. They advertise service by appointment and also for walk ins. There were 4 ladies working there when I arrived and they greeted me and had me in a chair in less than a minute. I was offered bottled water right away and after a brief explanation of services and Grand Opening specials I decided to get a manicure as well as a pedicure. Both services were extremely detailed and thourough. I was impressed by the extra effort demonstarted towards maintaining the highest standards of hygiene and cleanliness. The owner came out from the back and as his English is pretty darn good, we struck up a great conversation. \n\nI said at the start that I'm not an authority on nail salons or day spas as I only have recently begun to partake of such services, but I AM an authority of excellent customer care, great hospitality and superb service, and I found all three at Mimi's. I will become a regular at this place and I highly reccomend it to others. They spent over an hour working on my hands and feet and I felt like royalty with all the attention."
1,"I was so excited to hear they opened a Serendipity here.\n\nIt was a must to come and have a frozen hot chocolate.\nWe arrived in the afternoon and it was packed for a Monday.\nWe had to reserve and wait, but the bar seating was open.\nIt was a treat to sit there because we were able to watch the bartender make some yummy drinks.\n\nWe had a glass of sangria which was fresh and just good.\nThe frozen hot chocolate was just as I expected. I tried the Peanut Sin City Frrrozen Hot Mocha which had a shot of peanut rum.\n\nWe also ordered a cheeseburger and sweet potato shoe strings.\nThe sweet potato shoe strings were off the hook. I haven't had sweet potato fries like that.\n\nDefinitely will come back!"
0,"I wish I continued reading more reviews instead of just the first 3 and looking at the pictures.\n\nFirst I'll say is the wait was wayy too long.  We came into this place for a breakfast before we went to our volunteering event, and the wait for our food really made us pushing it to get there on time, not to mention the fact that we had to send our food back because it wasn't thoroughly cooked,\n\nNow onto the meal... Certainly not work the money!  The eggs were raw (and sent back as previously stated), the sausage was disgusting, the mushrooms dried out quickly.  They got my friend's order wrong, but since they didn't enter it correctly on the receipt, they didn't offer to correct her order either.  When I sent back my eggs, the waitress said \""just so you know, this is a french-inspired restaurant and this is how they eat their eggs\"".  Good for the French, but we're in America, and I want my eggs cooked all the way through... and not even an apology.   \n\nAs far as the service goes, they were just slow.  The staff came across as unapologetic and stressed, which I don't know why because while I was sitting there, I only saw them bring out food for the couple that ordered before us.  The other 4 sets of people that were there before us either didn't order food (I'm assuming because no food ever came for them) or already had their food.  \n\nOverall, it was just a bad experience.  If I can say anything positive, the macarons were good.  My friend enjoyed her croissant, and the timing for our replacement eggs were much quicker.  \n\nIF and its a big IF I ever go here again, it will be strictly for the pastries."
1,"Way way better than the Apple store. I spent 2 hours at the apple store and they couldn't help me, all they did was wipe phone phone, told me I needed to buy a new one.  Since I am from Canada I wouldn't buy one here.  I went to  Mac Media and in 20 minutes they had my original phone back to normal!!!  Great shop, saved me money and quick."
0,"Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood."
0,"Wanted to like this place.... really really wanted to. \n\nHorrible service, I mean absolutely horrible. \n\nI arrived and was starting to say what a friend recommended to me but I couldn't remember the name of it and the guy behind the counter snapped and cut me off and said \""I hear that ten times a day.\"" Well buddy since you've heard it before, I can understand that working in the service industry, you'd not expect to hear it again (sarcasm.) Whatever, I made my order and was told to go relax at a table. Well, I relaxed for 18 minutes with no food (turkey BLT I ordered) and watched everyone else get their food. I got up and asked if I was forgotten and there was absolutely no apology offered, but said they would bring it to me. \n\nWhen the guy brought over my sandwich, he kind of slammed it down on the table and walked away. No apology still, no offer to refund my meal, no come back later and try us again. They were just extremely rude about it. I understand, it happens... It's part of life, but they acted as if me not getting my food was a bother to them.\n\nHorrible customer service. I'll tell everyone I know about this story. Nobody should be able to treat their customers like that. A simple \""I'm sorry, come back and see us again for a free coffee\"" or something to that effect would have gone a loooooong way. \n\nToo stupid to get it probably. Or maybe because I didn't have a rat-tail with a mohawk, a basketball jersey, converse shoes, and an obvious roid rage attitude, they just didn't care."
1,"Got this place off Hotwire!  Loved the fact that there was no cigarette smell, and no casino in the hotel.  It gave us a more relaxed experience that didn't involve following shuffling masses through a loud, smoky casino to get to our elevator.  I definitely enjoyed that aspect.  The room itself was huge and super nice, the bed very comfortable (it took a LOT to actually drag ourselves out of it).  There was a huge bathroom (with jacuzzi tub, which you probably don't want to use because you KNOW they can't fully clean those...I actually went in the one in our room at the Trump and when we turned the jets on something that looked like skin CAME OUT OF THE JET, needless to say, I won't do that every again) and a little kitchenette area.  The pool was very relaxed, didn't really get a party atmosphere (though they try with some house music that starts around 1pm).  The day beds run $75 for the day, you get a fruit bowl and two mimosas included in the price...however the service can be SLOW.  Anyway, a mostly great stay.\n\nMy only complaints:  the maids came in only once during our day stay.  They completely missed Saturday.  Lame.  Also, the hotel is kind of far from the strip.  You can get a shuttle to Wynn or Caesars Palace, but the closest hotel is a good walk away (about ten-fifteen minutes to Treasure Island, same for the Wynn).  Also, everyone is definitely correct about that damn train!  Why the hell do you need a horn at 3am?  Seriously?"
0,"Come for the Mediterranean food, but not for the Mediterranean service. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly, however the time it took to get our orders in was quite a while. I had asked the waiter for a side of pita bread to go with my meal, but we did not see him for the rest of the night. Maybe he got lost in the kitchen where we frequently heard glasses being dropped. Our drink glasses were never refilled, and I had to ask for the bill, as we waited about 10 minutes after finishing without any sign of our waiter. Sad to say that such a wonderful meal could be spoiled by such terrible service. This place has a lot of potential, but definitely need to work on a couple things before they move up on my list. For the time being, I will definitely need to find another place to satisfy my craving for chicken shawerma."
1,"We organized a bachlorette party here and we had two major issues.  One the pre-fix menu and two the caviar bar seating.  Although most of my friends are rail thin, they can eat.  The menu included a taste of caviar, a garden salad and a petite filet.  The dessert was an ice cream cone.  Well, since the filet was more petite than we imagined, most of us were hungry...  We all laughed and said that we should of ordered the bachelor party menu (heh heh).  \n\nThe other thing we had issue with was the bar seating.  I was sitting at one end and the bride to be was sitting at the other.  I don't think we shared one word the entire dinner.   In hind sight, we would have just made reservations for seven and had whatever we wanted... \n\nI would have ranked this a three, but the trendy atmosphere and the free admission to rain was worth the extra star."
1,"I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.\n\nLombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.\n\nI will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi."
0,"To Sarah l. -\n\nBuy a box of wine and stay at home? Funny, you sound like you're probably an employee or something...\n\nThe point is that those of us who live downtown and do events to help PROMOTE local businesses are typically treated much more professionally - like had the manager gotten back to me when they said they would, I would have probably held the event somewhere else.  Groups of 40+ people boost sales - that's a typical no brainer.  If this restaurant can sustain itself on only having a decent happy hour crowd, but not listening to the people who live in the neighborhood, I'll be surprised if they last a year.\n\nThe good thing is that there are many great restaurants downtown who DO appreciate patronage and what the customers think - and apparently I'm not the only one who thinks the music is ungodly loud and their speakers suck."
0,"I have been coming here for awhile, and truth be told, the quality is getting worse.\n1st tip: DO NOT EVEN BOTHER with the fried oysters. You will hate yourself for ordering that. The oysters are so tiny, and it's not worth the money. Actually put the gator bites on the do-not-order list as well. They're smaller than the popcorn chicken you get at KFC. \nI normally come here and order the gumbo or she crab soup and make that a meal. A bowl runs you about $8-9, which is a lot more tolerable. Sometimes the gumbo comes out luke warm (at best), but it tastes good enough.\nIf anything, consider this place for a drink, they do have drink specials on the hurricanes and wine and beer. \nI really hate that one of the few cajun places in Charlotte is going downhill."
1,"don't often love corporate chains..but love the Yard House..great selections of drinks and food..love the variety...everyone is always pleased with their meal..from fresh salads to tacos..  :)  service is always friendly and accommodating......had the wings..tasty but small, ahi tuna salad and clam chowder.  The pork belly tacos and carnitas are also a crowd pleaser...keep up the good work!!"
0,Way over priced....... The service was terrible..need I go on?
0,"I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back."
0,"Where do I start!! I got a great deal on groupon\nSo I was really excited. I did read some reviews after I had booked. But I didn't pay much attention I thought I give it a try. I thought how bad can it be! \nIt was the worst experience ever!!!! Let me just say the lobby was nice it looked clean front desk was really nice. So I so happy and couldn't wait to go in room since I booked the suit with jacuzzi in my room. First thing I noticed as I left the lobby there was no Parking it was packed! I Eventually found a spot after 10min I get up to my room and I noticed the floors seemed dirty like no one moped then I start to feel all the dust up my nose. As I walking around the living room and upstairs to the room I notice the rug was dirty ass f*** toe nails ,Bobbie pins ,chips, screw nails lol I kinds of stuff and did I mention bugs!!!! I was so mad I called housekeeping and the lady was so mad when I pointed everything out! She told me she was tired of this lol then I told her there was no hand soap or bar she got even more mad! And said I don't have any. I asked her for two more towels she replied what for? I said well I need extras and she told me no I need to put them in other rooms. By this point I had enough once she left my room I went to target bought bleach and bleach my tub and jacuzzi!!! That's just the room! Then there is Street bombs living in the back of the hotel!!!! And smoking pot and who knows what! I was checking and checking on my car the hole night. And to top the cherry on top there airport plans pass like every 5seconds and that's all u hear all day and night so loud there is no relaxing! I do not recommend this place at all!!!!! This is horrible also btw!!!! I got bed bug bits!!!! On my feet  and legs I'm so serious guys!!!!!!!! I'm never going back even if it was free for life!!!! Never !!!!!!!!!"

0,"I was excited about visiting a new Indian restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh that is in close proximity to my office, but this lunch buffet visit of Monday, 22 September 2014 was a great disappointment.  I received a pleasant greeting and a 'thank you' from the owner.  The busser did not interact with me. No one performed a quality check or did anything to be assured of my satisfaction. Used plates were taken away promptly and I received a water refill without having to ask.  I agree with the writer who said that the place was too hot; this was the case even on a cool day. I had perspiration running down my neck while dining. Beware the dish which contains microscopic particles that appear to resemble broccoli and cauliflower as it is very spicy.  The only vegetable that could be readily identified in it is a few carrot slices.  I was hoping to find the staple Indian dish, aloo gobi, but it was not offered.  There was a dish which featured only potato slices and the cauliflower offered in the vegetable dish was not enough to satisfy any diner.  I arrived at 12:45, which should be the height of lunch hour.  There were only two diners there at that time, although a few other parties arrived during the short time I was there.  The buffet items had obviously been sitting out for a long time.  The white rice, which I was pleased to find was unadulterated by any seeds or seasoning, was in small quantities of clumps.  Many of the dishes needed to be replenished, but only the fried vegetable dish was during the time that I was there.  The signs denoting the names of the dishes are do not enable the American customer to determine their ingredients.  The tandoori chicken was quite tasty; I can only imagine how good it would have been if it had at least been served warm.  India Palace and Indian Spices on Sixth Street are far better choices for the Indian food lover, and Indian Spices is 58 cents less for the lunch buffet!"
0,"I never like to write a bad review....but if I experience bad service for the money that I have spent with you, then you're gonna get it.\n\nOnly 4-6 people were actually inside dining- I stood at the bar for nearly 5 minutes to pick up food before receiving the first 'hello.'\n\nFood wasn't that bad, actually even better the next day as left-overs\n\nBut for the $$$ spent, I'll stick with my other favorites...will give it another shot someday when its nice outside and I can take advantage of their outdoor seating."
0,"I finally made it to Rambo 's.  My Sweety has been there for lunch at least a half dozen times.  She is a huge fan of the lunch fare.\n\nThe good - a generally nice and relaxed atmosphere. I noticed a few folks with small dogs,  eating outside - al fresco. We sat outside.  Very comfortable.   The service was good - our waitress never let our tea below half.\n\nThe bad - we ordered up. A Rambo 's Country Breakfast for me  ( my eggs fried \"" over potatoes mixed with ham, bacon, and cheese. Sourdough toast )  My sweety ordered Rasberry Swirl French Toast.... we waited.... and waited .... well,  we knew they make all to order,  and they were busy,  it'll  be worth it ..... waited.  Finally our breakfasts arrived. Huge portions. Humongous.  After all the waiting,  you'd  think the food would at least be hot / warm.  Nope.  My breakfast companion got her raspberry french toast swirl, and it was not warm enough to melt butter  :-/  She said well \""\"" eff it I'm  not sending it back \""\"".    My potatoes were warm  but the eggs were cold, toast was too.\n\nMy sweety told me lunch is very good. Different crew,  not so busy.  So, I'll  probably be tempted to try lunch.  Pretty much over breakfast at Rambo 's.  That's  a no go for us both.  Sorry.\n\nTWO STARS for breakfast. That's  just because our servers kept the ice tea full."
0,"Unfortunately I will no longer be recommending Loving Hut. Is it because the food tastes like crap? No. Is it due to weird hours of business or bad service? No. It's because it's just too expensive now. Bordering on a complete rip-off.\n\nI got my usual Golden Vermicelli with a side of the Golden Rolls since I really like those (the GV comes with two rolls already). With tax, minus any drink and minus the $1 tip that I felt obliged to add since there was a tip section on the docket, the total was $13.12. I already mentioned that they've hiked their prices from the outdated menu that I got a few months ago, but I took another look at what I got and I'm not impressed at all with the value for money.\n\nLet's break it down. Shredded lettuce, shredded carrots, a half teaspoon of ground peanut with half as much again of finely chopped fried onion, a good amount of noodles (maybe even 20c worth), and a container of extremely watered down liquid - maybe 100 parts water to 1 part sweet and sour sauce? It's not a dip and not a sauce, just something to wet down the noodles with. Maybe 2 slices of julienned cucumber, and their soy protein. Took a photo. Compare today's pic with the first one I took of the same dish. There's even less soy protein now, barely enough for two mouthfuls, and a couple of fried rolls the length and width of my extended middle finger. I'm not sure how expensive soy protein itself is but thirteen spondooliks for that is twice as much as it is worth in terms of raw ingredients, far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe place is still clean. The service is still okay. Servers and counter folk are still very polite. Still conveniently located near my work. Still has Super Master on the telly. Still has a posterboard near the counter with bizarre letters and postcards from people verbally flagellating their pudendae about how awesome the place is, and the food is still tasty. Just woefully, WOEFULLY overpriced. This same syndrome exists at Tandoori Times II. I'd eat there AND here three times as often if only they delivered an amount of their food which matches the exorbitant prices they charge.\n\nAm I all about quantity over quality? Hell no. We're talking about a guy who paid over fourteen bucks for a small cube of fois gras on a 2\"" square bit of bread w/apricot compote, spent the next thirty minutes drooling over it and the next two years daydreaming about it. We're talking about a guy who just ate mostly lettuce and noodles and got charged twice the price of a lunch almost anywhere else in the local area, except for places like Claim Jumper or Olive Garden. Do I think 2 stars are appropriate a rating? Yelp classifies that as \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" So, yes.\n\nEven if you're a vegetarian, avoid this place. Save your cash. Go to Safeway. Buy a pack of noodles for a buck. Buy a whole lettuce for a buck. Buy carrots for.. you get the general idea. Buy some frozen edamame, mash it all up, squirt a bit of soy and worcester on it, form it into mint-patty-shaped discs and grill. I'm betting that'll be the same nutrition/protein and color as what their stuff is. Just pass on dining at this joint like I will be.\n\nI thought about posting this review for a while. The tipping point was the tiny gnat that I noticed on a piece of lettuce and would have eaten had I not been hunched close over the meal in my cubicle. Could have flown into the container, through the plastic bag etc, on the way out to the car, on the way back to the office, on the way INTO the office from the car. Or could have landed during food prep. I spent the next five minutes visually analysing the rest of the food before realising that there could be more gnats in the fried rolls where I'd have no hope of noticing them. Shrug."
1,Good stuff and pretty cheap too!!!
1,Show is absolutely fantastic. Great show & great skits.. highly recommended. Only suggestion I would def. Give is to purchase the upgraded seats for the additional $25.. trust me you'll be glad you did... If your the type to get offended by swears and vulgarity this show might not be for you... def. Made for 18+.. Alot of funny sexual contents...
1,Very good food! Nice staff! Would come back!
1,"This place has it all: the food, courteous staff and ambience.  The Shepard's Pie and Bread Pudding are out of this world.  Be prepared for large portions!  I enjoyed looking around at the interesting old photos and memorabilia on the walls.  Try it and it will become one of your favorites."
0,"Humble Pie is right across from one of my favorite hang-outs, The Main Ingredient. I've seen this place numerous times and one day we saw a Groupon for them, so decided to purchase it and give it a try. \nThe place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush? \nThe service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again. Wish we understood what all the hype is about. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizzas?"
1,Excellent green curry and everything else was tasty. Portions are small... Location is so central and easy to find. Don't be scared by the strip mall appearance.
1,"Stop by this place on a whim.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken (white meat, which is nice).  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty.  But the Orange Chicken could use a bit of improvement on the flavor.  They got the order ready at the time they said they would.  Also the corn egg soup was nice and light.  Would definitely go back to pick up food on this place."
0,I waited 15 min to be helped.when I was assisted the rep seemed nice.My upset sits with the store they needed a older connection to transfer contacts from one phone to another.But the one and only transfer connection was broken.this was my experience your might be a bit better.
0,"One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool"
0,"Definition of a roach motel with cockroaches working behind the front desk. I say its a waste of money remodeling \""the quad\"" \""the linq\"", \""imperial palace\"", whatever Ceasers is calling it now-a-days. I say save the money and level it. This place is disgusting and stinks! Worse than the worst motel 6 on the planet! Employees are such jerks too."
1,"I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot."
0,"This restaurant is the worst place to eat in Las Vegas!!!!  Everything you don't want in a restaurant is here.  Bad food, Bad service, Bad management, and expensive!!!!!!!!\nIf you're not chinese or white, forget getting a decent treatment from this people."
0,"Unbelievably poor experience times two! The first visit consisted of a one hour  wait in the waiting room and another hour wait in the exam room. The doctor didnt even acknowledge I had any body parts or brains for that matter, above the waist. My attempt to ask one question was abruptly cut short. At check out the girl was on her cell phone when she asked if she could help me. I went back thinking nd hoping the first experience was an aberration, knowing that any office or physician can have a bad day. Spent an hour in the waiting room again, an hour in a freezing exam room with only a piece of paper to cover me. No restroom facilities were ever offered, no one apprised me of the wait, nor apologize. The whole circus was unacceptable and unbelievable that a cancer center would treat sick people this way. If an office is running behind they need to call you and offer the opportunity to reschedule. And I would hope that this office would invest in some blankets and customer service training for physicians and staff. After a two hour wait the second visit, freezing to point of discomfort, and no sign that anyone was coming soon, I left. I will find treatment for my cancer somewhere else."
1,"Good food, cooked well, came out hot. Service was also very good. Waitress came back to top off coffees more than once. Prices also good, but cash only. Wouldn't wait if a really long line, but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out."
0,"I decided to have lunch there this week with my son.  This restaurant is by far one of the worst eateries that I have gone to.  \n\nIt was the first time for either of us.  The hostess sat us down without a word.  We had no idea why she had not given us a menu and waited 20 minutes before I asked a passing waitress if we could have a menu, only to be told rudely that they were already on the table.  You see, the 'menu' is in a form of a newspaper that was folded in two and tucked under the ketchup bottle. We had noticed the 'newspaper' but though it was just that, a newspaper.  The hostess never explained this to us.  \n\nAllow me to add that we arrived after the lunch rush time. We waited another 20 minuted before our waitress came to see us.  I had no idea she was in fact going to be our waitress before she presented herself to us.  You see, our waitress had been 'cruising' the gentleman who was alone at the table next to us.  They ultimately exchanged phone numbers. She was more preoccupied with flirting with him than she was with doing her job.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to notice how scantily clad the women employees in this place dress.  I have nothing against sexy attired women, but this was ridiculous.  Three of the four waitresses had tops that were so low cut that I felt very uncomfortable. What is up with that concept ? Looking around I noticed that there were more male patrons than women, and I guess that I shouldn't of been surprised.  My adult son obviously didn't mind their dress code, but then again, he is a man. \n\nI doubt I will ever go back there again.  The food was quite bland and the decor left a bad taste in my mouth.  My son's nachos were burnt (black) and when we pointed this out to our waitress, she told us that nachos were supposed to be burnt.  Wow ! Really !?  This is not the first time we order nachos in a restaurant. In any case, this place should focus more on food quality than on attracting clients with eye candy. \n\nIf any of you have seen the movie 'forty year old virgin', than you probably remember that scene where the main actor is on a speed date and he constanly tries to close his own shirt as a reaction due to the woman in front of him having a wardrobe malfunction. This is how I felt at the 3 Brasseurs. Definately not suitable for kids !!"
1,"Typical Vegas, went expecting nothing, got an incredible steak, seamless service and a good time."
1,Great place! I love their veggie burger!
1,"I think this might be one of the better wing places in the valley honestly.  The wings here are large and in charge, and I like that they don't over-batter them.  They always seem to come out crispy, and not drowned in sauce, which is a plus for me.  I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.  Service is friendly, and fast, and I like that they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and give you wet naps to clean up when you're done eating.  Also a big fan of their boneless \""wings\"", which are gigantic."
1,"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  \n\nThe salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  \n\nI believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  \n\nThe decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  \n\nService wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."
0,"This is not a medical facility if you are looking for long term management of your health.  I can't even say they are very reactive to any issues.  Instead, you will find that you wait in the lobby for much longer than you are treated.  Average wait time for me over the course of two years was about 20-30 minutes past the appointment time.  Average time waiting in personal room, another 15 minutes.  Average time speaking with \""doctor\"" or nurse practitioner  10 minutes.  \n\n30 minutes of waiting and 10 minutes of service.  The final straw was being charged 84  dollars to wait 30 minutes (the average) and then 2 minutes to pick up a prescription refill.  \n\nWhile many others may have had a better experience, I can not stand for the services and treatment received.  Don't keep going to this place if you hate it.  YOU HAVE OPTIONS!"
1,"I've lived in the neighborhood for a long time - and I've been to Luke's sporadically over the years. No good reason I don't go regularly - the food is always exactly what I expect and the prices are fair.\nI seem to stick with the Italian beef - but the menu also covers hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and Italian Sausage. (I will have to try sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce at some point - one of my ultimate comfort foods- to see if they're as good as Guido's in Scottsdale.)\nThe beef is juicy, shaved thin - and works perfectly with the giardinera and hoagie roll. \n\nFor those nights when I just need a mouthful of hot meat, Luke is my go-to guy! So happy I can satiate the craving right around the corner from home!"
0,"Things got worse after we checked in\n There were 2 service people standing with nothing to do but they said we had to see Joe. Well Joe was on a lengthy phone conversation so we waited 20 mins. for him to check us in. Made no sense to make an appt. There is absolutely no reason to do things this way. All I can think is these guys are on commission.:'( When I made the appt. I told them I would have to wait and gave them all of our information. Joe made us go over it all again. Name, phone #, address,  email address. He also asked if we could leave the car over the weekend. Frustrating to say the least. Can only imagine how long this is going to take. Just bad customer service. Won't go back."
1,"This location is my favorite one. \nSettled on a lake with an inviting patio, this is the perfect ambiance for a date or relaxing meal with friends. \nLocal art work adorn the walls and the atmosphere is pleasant. \nStart with the Hummus trio ( it's not listed on the menu but it's a plate with each hummus on it so you can experience every one) The cilantro Jalape\u00f1o hummus is heavily addictive. In fact, I'm gettin hot and bothered talking about it so... I digress.  \nThe Greek salad is super yummy to start with, and the wraps are heavenly. Lavosh Shawarma wrap is a customer favorite and the California beach club *with chicken* instead of turkey is super fresh and chalk-o-block full of goodness. If you wanna keep it more traditional, the Beef Gyro is even more delicious when accompanied by Sriracha sauce.\n \nI go here all the time and love this place more and more with every visit. Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers"
0,"Ok, so you bake the English Muffins..we get it, but are they really worth 10 bucks for 6 of them? This is the theme of this Arcadia joint. The prices for stuff at dinner are unreasonable. It is at least 14 bucks for a burger on a very limited menu after 5pm. The sandwiches at lunch seem tastier and are better priced, so why not serve them all day, plus you cannot find a parking spot during the day either. They also own the fancy pizza place and some joint across the street as well. I ended up with a $3.25 Gluten free Chocolate chip cookie and it was big and gooey and had a bunch of nuts. Not too bad for a cookie in that category. Break the bank at dinner and watch all the lovely Arcadia types wander into this family friendly domain."
1,"My wife and I went her New Year's Eve night, 2010. We loved it! The atmosphere and service is fantastic. The staff is dressed very authentically Japanese and loves to interact with their clientele.\nThe food was amazing. I had fried oysters, which are brought out in the shell. There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. Our bill was approx $60 for 2 entrees, two appetizers, twos soups and salads. It was a very nice experience and date!"
0,"This was my 2nd time at a Twin Peaks. The 1st was in Austin, TX. This one had the most unfriendly waitresses. Barely saw ours, even when needing our check. The other waitresses were clustered in the back or someplace where they couldn't be seen.\n\nAs for the food. I enjoyed a burger with fries. It was prepared the way it was described on the menu. But there is no reason for me to return to this location in Scottsdale. I can get a better burger elsewhere (Whataburger). I was hoping to see the waitresses. Not at this location, though."
1,"My dog, Riley, is a total disaster of a dog. She's so pretty, but there's not much there in the way of smarts. But we love her!\n\nSo when she was bitten by a rattlesnake, I of course raced her here for treatment. The staff are extremely knowledgable, smart, friendly and forthcoming with information. They told me upfront that this was going to be expensive and all the different options. No beating around the bush, nothing vague or general, just to the point. It was great, totally got the hard part out of the way. \n\nShe was treated with kindness by people who obviously love animals. Yes, it was expensive, about $1700, but obviously completely worth it. \n\nSo remember when I said Riley isn't the smartest? Yeah, well two days after the rattler incident, she ate a bottle of midol. I again found myself back in the clinic. Most of the staff remembered her and treated me and her with the utmost in professionalism and concern. \n\nThat was another $650. (I love my dog.. i love my dog...I love my dog .. I keep reminding myself...).\n\nOy. Well anyway. I would reccommend this clinic to anyone with a pet in distress."
1,There is always good stuff to find at the Maxx.  This store is a great way to kill an hour looking for something and end up spending 10 bucks.
1,"I come here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to see the funny faces people make when they taste some of the samples of Coca-Cola from around the world. \n\nIt's funny. Damn funny. I was a sucker once and did it. I regretted it immediately .\nIf ya want to know what piss tastes like, try the coke from Italy. NASTY. \n\nFour stars for the free, hilarious entertainment."
0,I have to admit I've never been inside of this club but I'm only speaking on the experience while waiting in line. If you are looking to be tricked into paying double for this club I recommend not to go. We waited in line for two hours and decided to leave. \n\nThe organizers of the club who ever they are just wants their commission and how do I know this? I personally asked. He told me they don't make money from inside of the club only the bar does so they have to get their commission somehow telling people to pay twice the amount to get in. I don't knock their game but I'm not the one that will be paying double for any club when they were closing in an hour. \n\nThe line for people who was paying regular price didn't move at all only the line for people who payed over 100 to get in!! Due to the bad experience that I had I will not plan to go back there and attempt to get in I will stick to my usual spots.
0,"Not much to see here.  Basically a sports book that sells bar food with Emerils name on it.  Has a few dishes that are creole/Cajun in style but most of the menu is what you would find at any sports bar.\n\nFood was decent, but nothing special.  Does have TVs at each table and of course the ability to wager on the games that day.  Service was good but the place was empty.\n\nBar selection was standard, has some more premium beers along with the standards, but no craft beers.  Probably would not make a special trip here."
0,"Went here with my hubby about a month ago. We had a coupon that they excepted with no questions asked.\n\nThey claim to serve \""gourmet\"" burgers but they were ordinary burgers to me. Something that you can order from Carl's Jr or Red Robin. My one complaint is that my husband and i got charged an $2.50 extra for an extra plate. All i asked for was an extra plate. That was bullsh**. When i saw the charge i complained to the waitress right away and she did take the charge off. I also noticed that the waitresses paid more attention to the men than the women in each table. not cool...\n\nWould I back to this place.... neh, i would  rather spend my money at another place like \"" EARL OF SANDWICHES... HEHE"
0,"Oh my goodness, this place is so bad it's almost funny.\n\n1. The alcoholic slushies somehow manage to have a rancid ether-like smell and to have seemingly no alcohol in them at the same time. They also taste strongly of food coloring. I could barely finish mine, which was highly recommended by the waitress.\n\n2. A friend of mine took one bite of his \""cheesesteak\"" and didn't touch it again. I can only assume it was inedible. I hedged my bets and got chips and a trio of dips: salsa, spinach and artichoke, and \""homemade\"" cheese sauce. I thought, how bad can this be? To hedge further, I asked the waitress if the cheese was actually made in house. \""Um I don't know, I don't work in the kitchen.\"" I would have prompted her to go find out, but I figured again (unwisely), how bad can it be? \n\nHere's a breakdown of how bad it was: the chips were stale. The salsa had a strangely off taste and smell...almost as though it was borderline bad. I took a few bites just to be sure, and my date did too. Yup. Something is wrong. The spinach and artichoke dip had a distinct freezer note. And the cheese sauce.  Ohh the \""homemade\"" (it said so on the menu!!) cheese sauce.  I would bet my firstborn that pool of fetid yellow rubber was not conjured in house. If it was, holy crap, these people need to fire their cooks.\n\n3. We were in the quiet part of the bar, relatively speaking, and it was still fairly noisy. After sometime around 9:30-10, someone turned up the music so loud we were shouting over it. We settled our bill and got the heckfire out of there.\n\nNot many places raise my ire to scathing one-star levels, but Wet Willies did in a big way (this is probably abundantly clear). The real tragedy is that it seems like people consider this a fun place to hang out with decent daiquiris. I can only thank God I'm not in the drink-my-face-numb phase of my life anymore, if this is how the young'uns get it done in Charlotte."
0,"Ohkay, So I was working 3rd shift this day, Went throu the drive throu got a Carmel Machiatto. These people, over flilled the coffe to where when they handed it to me, and i put the straw in it over flowed onto my work scrubs! not to mention the coffee was burnt!!\n\nI mean yeah more for your money but not when its all over you and you hav burnt coffee..... SO.... Taste before you drive off!! Not to mention, when I went back to get \""Fresh\"" coffee, they were totaly rude about it!"
1,"The bruschetta is tasty and a great starter.\n\nThe Oregano's Salad (hold the olives) is just bomb. Order the small and it's enough for 3 adults.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (added pineapple) and it was tasty. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh, and it's not greasy.\n\nThe servers are upbeat, fast, and knowledgeable.\n\nThe menu is kind of huge and you can skip over things easily, but do NOT miss the warm cookie pie for dessert.\n\nPS - if you are cold and sitting outside, ask for a blanket...they've got them!"
1,"Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion."
0,"This is one of the worse restaurants ever! I must admit their food is somewhat delcious but the service is a big FAT F! My freinds and I decided to dine in late one night. We ordered and as usual these waiters in chinese restaurants are rude which we just ignored. As our order was put in they waiter comes back with our BILL, he stated \"" the cashier is leaving and they were ready to close the register\"". We did not even receive our food and they were already throwing the bill at us. I thoguht that was flat our rude!! even thou the food was good we were not doing to deal with this we got up and left the table! I would not reccomend this place at all! they were closed before for a horrible food inspection grade of F. Your better off eating at panda express!"
0,"Waitress. the turkey burger is cold. Can you recook? We brought another. Ah, look, it's pink and uncooked. Sorry, we are learning the grill. That's my review. I hope it's better for you. Food is not a priority."
0,"Tried to give this little place to evolve into a great neighborhood joint... Instead it raised its prices within the first month on mediocre food. A couple months later it still is serving Spring rolls stuffed with brown rice not veggies, bad Pad Thai that was too lemony to eat and tasteless chicken. The decor is nearly as bad as the food. When in the area I will dine at one of the neighboring restaurants."
1,"Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to \""upsell\"" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure."
1,"Been here a few times because I was too lazy to drive to my regular soho a few more miles down. Was in and out so I never really took the place in. Then one day I heard they had a salad bar and I had to go back. I didn't even remember seeing one my first few visits. When I get there I heard a choir and I laid my eyes on said salad bar not to mention gelato, pizza,sushi, you name it. Crazy I missed it. This place is awesome. Salad bat was even better than whole foods. Very clean and well kept. Music in the background makes u feel like you're shopping in a movie. I keep getting the loopy cashier who just loves to talk about her plans once she's free. Can't stay away from this place. Dukedom here I come"
1,My experience with Rebecca and Integrity All Star Team was GREAT!! They were available when I needed them to be. Gave me expert information about homes I was interested in. Was very professional and patient. I truly believe they had my best interest at heart. Without any questions one of the best Real Estate teams in Phoenix Az
1,I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\n\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again.
1,So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!
1,"Best place! Great service and selection. Also, very competitive and after much of comparison shopping I was back! \nLinas was very friendly and knowledgeable. He is very passionate for what he does and I saw him taking care of customers. \nDefinitely coming back!"
1,"They did a great job. They got us right in, they have massage chairs, they were very good.  They gave us bottled water. My daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it."
0,Prices are fair but 45 minutes to wash and vac my car? That's a little much. Undecided if I'll be a returning customer.
0,"Went in for a much needed CarWash on 2-17-2014. Found this spot through groupon, the 49.00 manager special. Called to ask what it all included and it had me sold when he mentions shampooing car mats. The guy \""Moss\"" checked me in telling me to not to buy the groupon the honer the same price. Then I asked for pricking on shampooing the whole car he says about another $50 I passed & went with the manager special. \n\nWaited an hour for me car and was really pleased with the job they had done & tipped really good. \n\nThe next day I hop into my my car I noticed a foul smell that reminded me of a dirty diaper.  Couldn't figure it out sprayed stuff to hide the smell and drove to work. About 9 hrs later I hop back into my car with my girlfriend & the first thing she says is... what's that smell?!? I told her I had no idea. She then asked if my carpets were cleaned I said yes! I checked & sure enough there still wet and smell horrible. Called the next day & was told I would receive a call from the manager. Minutes later \""Moss\"" calls to ask what the problem was I simply explained & he tells me to not raise my voice I replied I'm not just wanna fix the problem. He gets smart with me and tells me to bring my dirty diaper smelly car in so his boss can tell me the same thing he told me which was noting. haha. I called back to find out why he called and the boss didn't. Girl that answer apologized about it and she was sorry for him being unprofessional. I told her to tell her boss I will pass on Coming back to fix my carpets and will simply right this review to warn future costumers about the risk of shampooing carpets."
1,This place is the best nail salon when it comes to nail art.  Lilly is extremely talented and I highly recommend her. I drive from the other side of town to this place. I also had a great pedicure that came with paraffin wax.
0,"I would not recommend this hotel. The bellman takes FOREVER...so long that we had to go down and get our own luggage after calling for an hour!\n\nThe sheets were literally TORN and stained! We didn't notice until the next morning. We tried to leave it evident for the cleaning lady but she didn't change them so we called and asked for the sheets to be changed. They were replaced with more TORN sheets! \n\nThe hotel doesn't have a casino which was fine for us but the lobby was very smoky! If you want a casino it's just a couple min walk to the adjoined Mandalay Bay.\n\nI don't see a place to separately rate the Spa. It was designed not to lounge but more of a man's spa so it's more masculine. The hot tubs weren't that hot. HOWEVER, I think her name was Verona or something like that and she gave me THE BEST deep tissue massage of my life! Sorry I don't remember her name exactly but she's been there 8 years and we went a few weeks ago so I've slept since then! LOL"
1,I gave this company a five star primary base on a young man who service us. He had recently move over from Enterprise. He was extremely polite and thorough with everything he do. He make sure that there were no glitches that made our experience with them a bad one. \nDue to him we had a great 2 week of vacation and will recommend Advantage Rent-a Car to all of our friends and family. \nThe only regret is I lost this young man name. He should be rewarded for all his extra effort. Great Job and Services!
1,"I had no idea the history of the restaurant until we arrived. Our host pointed out that the building is actually made of adobe, as there was an \""open\"" wall to showcase this. It was built by an artist and his work is displayed on the walls of the restaurant. \nThere is a traditional southwestern, cowboy motif throughout, but it's tastefully done. \nI heard Lon's was great for their sunset views and chose this as a special place to bring my husband for his birthday.  Unfortunately, no one was seated outside on their patio and where we were seated inside, we couldn't see the sunset, which was disappointing. \nI have only positives to say about the food and the service however. Attentive, friendly, polite, we never felt that we were looking around for our waitress. As a matter of fact when I reached around to grab our bottle of wine to refill our glasses she magically appeared to do that for us.\nDinner was amazing; from the tasty breadbasket and herb butter through the sabayon dessert. We ordered the salmon and halibut which were cooked beautifully. The pommes and beer-battered maikaki (sp?) mushroom sides were devoured.  Get the mushroom if you go...it was our favorite item of the evening.\nI made the reservation on open table and mentioned that it was my husbands birthday. When we were seated our host gave a card to my husband which was signed by the staff. I thought it was a nice touch."
0,Cafe Myriade is a cute little coffee shop serving 49th Parallel Coffee.\n\nComing here with high expectation and was a little disappointed!\n\nBoth Americano and Cappuccino we ordered were both overly fruity to even sour.\n\nThe search of a great cup of espresso drink continues....maybe I just stuck to drinking beers!
1,"In a time when Las Vegas restaurants are remodeling left and right in order to provide a more causal dining experience, Sage still has an almost hidden entryway.  We stopped by near opening time for cocktails ... and a little foie gras.  Originally skeptical, the Foie Gras Custard Brulee was enough to make us want to stop by for a full dinner sometime.\n\nThe bar has some good beer on tap - mostly Belgians or Belgian-styles.  They also have a respectable classic cocktail menu.  We came to try out some absinthe, though.  They're a little ... overly sensationalistic ... about the recent availability and changes in law, but they have a decent selection of bottles to choose from and are happy to make recommendations in a variety of price ranges.  They also do the fun, flaming \""Bohemian Method\"" of serving it ... or the more staid French water dripping thing.\n\nService at the bar was friendly and fun ... we were about the only people in the restaurant at that hour, though."
0,Overpriced. \nNo Service. \nThis place used to be good. Every time we go Vegas we'd go this place. But this time I was really disappointed. Lack of service & overpriced items. Not worth the hype.\nWe'll look different place for our sushi spot next visit.
0,"So disappointing. This used to be the BEST sushi place around... Until the new ownership recently. Sushi was terrible... Small... And overpriced. I got a box which had TINY portion sizes. The soup bowl I got was half filled, the beef teriyaki was over cooked and terrible, the vegetable tempura consisted of 3 tiny pieces, and the salad was meh. The new owner supposedly is cutting down on portion sizes, which is quite obvious, but she is not cutting down on price. That, to me, is greedy and I don't think a good way to run a business. Although the owner was \""nice\"", a few of her comments rubbed me the wrong way and her lack of attentiveness was ridiculous. (We asked for the check 3 times). We spent $40 and left so dissatisfied. Won't be going back anytime soon... Or at least until new ownership comes again... Which probably won't be long if the service and food remain the same. No way this place could stay in business. Don't waste your time here...."
1,Best food in Anthem. Been going here for years and food has been consistently delicious. These folks take pride in what they do and it shows! I hope someday they open a bigger place. Yum!
0,"They lost my credit card!!!!\n\nWhen we were ready to leave we gave our waiter our credit card to pay for the bill.\nWe waited five minutes, ten minutes, and fifteen minutes! Started to get a bit anxious that nobody would come back with our card. When he finally came back . . . with our check yes, but not with our card,  he told us that the card had been lost in the way to the register but he was sure it was there and he was going to look for it, find it and bring it back.  After 30 minutes again, no card, of course.  \nI decided then that it was too long to wait and made a call to our bank to block the card.\nthis was the card we were going to use for most of our travel expenses.  What a mess!\nI'm very disappointed and would not recommend this place, not just for the fact that they lost our card, but for what they told us after finally revealing that the card was definitely lost.\nExact words and I'm quoting \""We apologize for the inconvenience, can you please give us another card to pay for your check we promise this time we won't lose it\"".  UNBELIEABLE!!!!!"
0,"Proportions are appalling.  I ordered 1lbs. wings for $8, and got 6 medium sized wings.  I got an appetizer order of fries and got what I would say is a single order of fries... And that was $6... I ended up paying $14 for $7-$8 of food.  Extremely dissatisfied.  Save your money; don't order the wings or fries!"

1,Best oyster shooters!  Get the lobster bisque!\nService and view were amazing!\nWaiter went out of his way to retrieve my Rewards Card!  Complimentary champagne since we were celebrating two birthdays!  We had a great time and a lovely meal!
1,Great service last Thursday when I was holiday shopping. The shoes I wanted were not in stock but they offered to mail them to me free of charge. They said they couldn't guarantee they would arrive by Christmas but Friday evening at 6pm there was a knock at my door and they were delivered! Amazing!
1,"Ok, here's the thing.....I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio eating Polish, German and Slovenian meat & sausage.  Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic \""hood.\""   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, \""Now how do you pronounce that?\""  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.  \n\nI stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some. They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!"
1,A step above The Street in Mesa but not as good as Bomb Boba and other places in West Phoenix. Still pretty good though and they have a lot of flavors and varieties of Boba.\n\nAlways get the Honeydew Slush~
1,"Der Kebap Express liegt fast an der Haltestelle M\u00fchlburger Tor und ist somit sehr gut gelegen und gut zu erreichen.\n\nEs war ein Sonntag ca. halb1 nachts und jeder D\u00f6ner Laden in der Umgebung hatte bereits zu, au\u00dfer der Kebap Express.\nDa weder mein Cousin, noch ich diesen D\u00f6ner Laden kannten, dachten wir uns, bevor wir weiter suchen, probieren wir einfach den Kebap Express.\n\nDer Kebap Express ist wie ein typischer D\u00f6nerladen. Man geht durch die T\u00fcr und schon ist man im Raum, indem 2/3 Tische mit St\u00fchlen stehen und vorne direkt die Theke.\nAn den Tischen sa\u00dfen Leute, welche wohl Stammg\u00e4ste sind, da diese mit dem Inhaber plauderten.\nF\u00fcr uns unterbrach der Inhaber sofort das Gespr\u00e4ch und wir wurden sofort bedient.\nAm D\u00f6nerspie\u00df war aufgrund der Uhrzeit nicht mehr allzuviel dran, von daher war uns klar, dass es nicht mehr die Top Qualit\u00e4t sein kann.\nWir bestellten 2 D\u00f6nerpizza und diese wurden direkt zubereitet. Nach normaler Wartezeit 6 / 7 Minuten waren diese fertig.\nDie Pizza kostet 6 Euro ( ist Standardpreis ).\nDer D\u00f6ner kostet hier wie \u00fcberall 4,50\u20ac, was ich sehr teuer finde, aber f\u00fcr Karlsruhe leider inzwischen v\u00f6llig normal ist. F\u00fcr mich kann der D\u00f6ner noch so super genial sein, 4,50\u20ac ist definitv kein D\u00f6ner wert, aber na gut, da kann das Kebap Express nichts, da es wie gesagt \u00fcberall 4,50\u20ac kostet.\n\nNachdem wir bezahlt hatten geno\u00dfen wir unsere D\u00f6nerpizza.\nWir waren beide positiv \u00fcberrascht, hatten doch aufgrund des wenigen Fleisches am D\u00f6nerspie\u00df nicht mehr allzuviel erwartet.\nDas Fleisch schmeckte noch sehr gut und auch der Teig der Pizza war sehr gut und knusprig.\n\nDas Problem bei den meisten ist, dass diese das Fleisch auf Pizza legen und anschlie\u00dfend in den Ofen machen, dadurch wird das Fleisch ein bisschen zu hart.\nIch mag es lieber, wenn die Pizza gebacken wird und daraufhin einfach nur das Fleisch auf die Pizza gelegt wird.\n\nDie So\u00dfe schmeckte ebenfalls nicht sooo gut. Man kann sie essen, aber etwas weltbewegendes war sie nicht.\n\nIm Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen haben wir unseren Besuch jedoch nicht bereut.\n\nF\u00fcr den Geschmack w\u00fcrde ich 3 Sterne geben, da unser Besuch allerdings sehr sp\u00e4t war und der Kebap Express noch offen hatte, gebe ich einen weiteren Stern f\u00fcr die guten \u00d6ffnungzseiten."
1,THANK YOU TOY BOX!!\nI took my car to the Toy Box to have them take a second look at $800 worth of work - strut replacement - that another valley mechanic had quoted me.  Turns out there was nothing wrong with my struts and they saved me $800!!  Their honesty and integrity will be remembered and they have gained a customer for life!  Thanks again Phill and crew...you guys are the best!!
0,"Can't select zero stars so I give it 1. I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey. I read many of the less than stellar reviews and decided they were likely posted when they first opened and that by now they have the kinks worked out. This was a horrible experience riddled with questionable food and terrible service. When you pay $27 for fish and chips you want it to be the best or very close to it. The batter on the fish was way to heavy and thick. The fries were limp. They'd been sitting in a warmer way too long. They were almost soggy. My daughter could even eat her burger. I thought it was funny they didn't even ask about the burger when 3/4 of it is left our her plate when we finally got our bill. I also didn't get the chilled water and no ice in the glass thing. I asked if we could get ice and they brought me ice, not the rest of the table. Then every time we needed a refill we had to ask for it. Gordon Ramsey, maybe you could sign this place up for Kitchen Nightmares. Then you could go in a fix it."
1,"We have eaten here a handful of times, and today we returned to have the dinner buffet.This buffet offers many different selections and is always a decent meal.   We arrived early and there was no line.   We were first in line and there was many open seats yet it took them 8 minutes to show us a table.   Once seated we went through the line to be pleasantly surprised at the many different dishes they offered this time around.   We had some of the sushi, shrimp tempura, cucumber salad, fried rice, and some of the prime rib,  The sushi was not great,  I could tell it had been wrapped earlier in the day as the nori had really become hard.   The shrimp tempura was really good, yet they did not have any tempura dipping sauce.  The cucumber salad was fresh, but not marinated long enough.   The deserts were awesome, and our server was excellent.  One thing about buffets, if you space the time out visit to visit, you appreciate the offerings.   A very good buffet.  4 stars (5 stars when they start offering crab)"
0,"Drink service deplorable.   Tacky, tacky deco, if you can even call it that.   Its cheap, convenient to the strip.  That's about all I can say.  Hotel rooms dated and some are worn, tho not thread bare.  Average to slightly below average.  Kids EVERYWHERE underfoot.  NOT a fave of mine.  I give it the second star for the occasional decent  free circus acts."
1,"*sigh* Oh, how I wish The Barrymore was located in San Diego instead of Las Vegas!  I haven't been this impressed with a dining establishment since I can't remember when.  \n\nLove, love, love the old-school Hollywood decor, dim lighting, and deep, plush leather booths line the dining room. The ceiling is decorated with old film reels, the vibe is very retro-Vegas with a heavy dash of Mad Men. Although we didn't sit outside, I caught a glimpse of fireside outdoor seating off the bar area.\n\nI admit that I had been drooling over the menu for days in anticipation of our Saturday dinner reservation. So many amazing looking choices!  The menu read like a Hollywood A-List with a high number of Oscar winners.\n\nInstead of giving a review for each dish, I'm just going to come out and say that everything that made its way to our table and into our bellies was top of the line delicious.  Presentation, composition, flavor...these dishes had it all. \n\nOur appetizers: Roasted Heirloom Beets (the goat cheese fritters..I die!!), Roasted Artichokes, Lobster Mac & Cheese (my personal Achilles's heel).  The Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup might possibly be the average plates delivered.  Not bad, just completely outshone by the other dishes.\n\nDinner: Diver Scallops, Pan Roasted \""Jidori\"" Chicken, Short Rib Bourguignon, Muscovy Duck Confit, Bone-in Aged Ribeye.  There wasn't a stinker in the lot.  All perfectly cooked and seasoned (although I personally would prefer a tiny bit less salt, it did not necessarily taste over salted).  \n\nExcellent cocktail and wine selections, too.  The biggest star of the show had to be the service.  It was amazing.  Really was the clincher for a perfect evening.  They know what they're doing at The Barrymore.  I hope to go back again and again!"
0,"Up until Friday, this salon was my favorite. Unfortunately, I will not be back. I asked for the upgraded callous removal which I have successfully received in the past. My female nail tech went so far that I have raw, scabbed toes and heel...only on my right foot. Tom was my favorite tech but he was unavailable, even when I asked for him for my appointment. \n\nNice shop with pleasant staff but one tech ruined it for me."
0,"Like other commentators, the speed of service is horrid. If you see a long line already at the drive thru, I advise to keep on driving. The quality of the ice cream is very satisfactory, but it's hard enjoying it when poor customer service and speed of service are low. It was also disappointing to see them skimp on the amount of my ice cream despite having to wait an incredibly long time (not only because the huge Gilbert family in their Suburban in front of me took forever to order - which they did - but they argued at the drive thru attendant and spun out their tires as they left). For that, they only get two stars and my only visit back to them is if I'm the only person in the store."
0,"You know what, if it was only possible not to give this club a star, I wouldn't freakn even give it half a star!! Worst club I've ever been to. We went here the first night we got to vegas for my sister's bachelorette party. We got in free because they were basically letting everyone in for Free, even guys!! I think that just goes to show  how desperate they are to compete with club XS..moving along...got in... the place is 2 floors, but the dance floor is soo small! We danced and tried to make the best of it until they freakn dropped the bomb....at least two bouncers/promoters  approached my group of girls and told us that they will take us to a  special VIP area..so we thought \""oh they're giving us a table\"", wrong!! they took us to this one guy's table! the bouncer talked to the owner of the vip table and automatically we knew what the hell was going on!! Just got me so fkn annoyed that they are treating a group of girls like freakn prostitutes! we are not for  sale a holes!! we walked out of that club pissed as hell. They make girls feel cheap and worth less. Im sure this did not just happen to us! terrible terrible!! They were desperately trying to please all the male Vip tables. pathetic! XS will always be #1!! never again!! i hope this club closes down! beware of this club! What they are doing is very demeaning towards women! F this club! excuse my french! =)\n\n\nFORGOT TO MENTION...DRINKS IN THIS CLUB WILL COST YOU AN ARM AND A LEG! ONE TOKYO TEA= $17.00 ( NOT INCLUDING TIP) HAHA OMG IM JUST SPEECHLESS!"
1,"Sunday brunch was great It was a perfect day to enjoy the good food, a sangria and good companionship in the lovely outdoor setting.  There bread and pesto sauce served prior to the meal is to die for,  Over time I have had many of their menu items, all of them pleasing to me.  this visit I had oatmeal, one companion had a very delicious salad. (I tried it) The meal and the surroundings make this Sunday  a special day.  I must mention that there was a slight snag with our reservation but the manager Genevieve Wallick quickly resolved the problem.  The high quality of the management in this restaurant Is defiantly a plus and adds to the overall experience."
1,"My boyfriend hunted down these tasty little chocolates for me on Valentine's Day. I have been wanting to try these local morsels for a while, especially since I recently became vegan. I believe they were a little on the pricey side... but completely worth it because a little goes a long way. We enjoyed the \""Wei Relaxed\"" dark chocolate and the \""All the Wei\"" dark chocolate collection which included chai, citrus, chili, espresso, and dark flavors. Check out the Wei of Chocolate Facebook page for a list of retailers that carry their products. Happy chocolate eating!"
0,Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.
1,"It was my 2nd trip here.  The first time I had the roasted galic & mozzarella chicken sausage with a side of chili cheese tater tots.  This time I went for the Habanero chicken sausage and the Bratwurst.  Of all I tasted I must say the Habanero!\na little bit of heat, but very flavorful.  \n\nThe service is great. both the chef and waitress always come by and check if everything is ok or if I need anything."
0,"I thought I'd try this place again, but that was a bad decision! My salad had watery brown lettuce, brown watery guacamole and was honestly just gross. It is over $10 for a salad here and that is crazy to me since its neighbors are Gadzooks and Chipotle where I can get 4-5* quality for at least a couple of dollars less."
1,"I have to say, as much beef as is eaten in Vegas I am surprised cows aren't extinct yet...there are steakhouses everywhere of varying quality. I really dug this one. The bone-in ribeye was just about the best steak I have had in this town, the waiter's wine recommendation was spot-on, and the service was impeccable. \n\nOne thing I noticed, and this separates the good from the great. No service person approached us when we were chewing. That's the worst, being asked a question when your mouth is full. I'd think it was a coincidence, but I saw the manager walking toward us just as I took a bite, and he obviously diverted to another table...a minute later he stopped by and asked us how everything was. That's cool."
1,"Our group of seven ate here on a Wednesday night. We had made a reservation earlier in the day and were only able to get a 915pm seating (so make a reservation in advance if possible). We were seated at a very large table, which had large comfortable chairs. The room was dimly lit and had an open and airy feel (since the back of the restaurant opened to the pool. All of the food and drinks were very good. The service was not extremely fast but we were not in a hurry so it didn't make a difference to our group."
1,"Ok, so I wrote my review yesterday and I am writing my update from my phone because I have no internet. In the last two hours my internet dropped 4 times and the TV lost connection 3 times. You get centurylink prism and you will be paying for intermittent service."
1,"Epic Thrift in Mesa opened in November, 2013...and it's conveniently located right around the corner from my house!  I have to admit, I LOVE this place.  I'm here at least once a week!!!\n\n The store is nice and clean...especially for a thrift store.  It's very organized and easy to shop!  And the employees are all super nice!  It's a lot like Goodwill, you have different colored tags that represent the discount that day.  At least one Saturday a month everything in the entire store is 50% off!!!  And every time I shop there, I get a \""buy one, get one free\"" coupon!!  \n\nThere's a great selection of baby clothes (my 3 month old nephew has gotten some super cute outfits from there!!) and kids clothes (my 7 year old niece loves \""Justice\"" brand clothing) and I find a ton of stuff for her there, at great prices!\n\n\nTotally cool place, if you're a thrift-er, you gotta check this spot out!!!"
0,"Skip this place. Cheap sushi, sure. But not very good at all. Just go to TA on happy hour and you get so much better quality for only a little bit more and so much more variety"
0,"As I moved here from FL, where I am accustomed to excellent Cuban food, I tried to be as neutral as possible when reviewing this restaurant.  I ordered my old favorite, Vaca Frita, with Moro and a side of Maduros since the plates don't come with Maduros.  The Vaca Frita was extremely fatty and the Maduros were so scorched, I was trying to peel off the black parts to get to the sweet plantain portion, but they were not salvageable.  The restaurant looked clean and the staff was friendly so I may try this place one more time to give it a fair shake (will order the Lechon Asado/Pork instead though) so let's see what happens on try #2....for try #1, and for the drive I took to get there, I was not impressed."
0,"Used to love this place, wonderful food, but went today at lunch and what a disappointment.  One poor guy behind the counter trying to assemble meals with no help, and so slow.  Had the smoked chicken sandwich, mac & cheese and coleslaw.  The chicken was just ordinary, mac & cheese was soupy and tasteless and the coleslaw was not seasoned at all.  Maybe new management as the choice of meals is much less than previously.  What a shame."
0,"If you are the kind of person who likes pushing people out of the way to get to a shirt or if Black Friday is your Superbowl, then this is the store for you.\n\nGenerally depending on what time and day you go, it may or may not be insanely busy. For some reason I always show up when there are not so many people. You can find some good deals here if you look but the merchandise if always changing and that is not always the case. The shoe section is what grosses me out half of the time I go here because at least at a thrift store they throw out shoes that are extensively worn, smelly and stained. Here they will sell them to you in the name of it being a high end brand. I saw these tennis shoes that were worn with mud and I thought that someone had taken off their shoes and left them there and shoplifted some other ones, but they were selling them!\n\nI usually do not like shopping because I do not like people to get too close to me and I do not like children suddenly darting in front of me or scaring me by popping their face out of a clothing rack. To say it ineloquently, people will be all up in your grill here. Seriously there is chaos at this store to be had. Be sure not to trip down those stairs."
1,"Queen Creek Olive Mill has delicious sandwiches, gelato, and of course, olive and balsamic vinegar products. I wouldn't come here for breakfast because it's pretty standard fare, but the sandwiches are great. It's a little bit pricey, but it's a nice experience."
0,"This was hands down the worst stay I've had in Vegas. Aria takes itself so seriously, but lacks any sort of substance. Everything about this place is wrong, from the overdone technology that barely functions to the almost inedible room service.\n\nI booked a room at the Sky Suites. The stay started off well enough, with a limo picking me up and taking me to the \""private\"" entrance. The free \""lounge\"" area was nice except for the scores of other guests scurrying to hoard as much free stuff as possible. The frenetic atmosphere of this area reminded me more of a Shoneys than a classy lounge.\n\nThe technology in the room was excessive and barely worked. The jets in the Jacuzzi tub turned on randomly. We ordered 2 pizzas from room service that were, without a doubt, the worst pizzas I've ever had in my life. And I've had a lot of pizza.. The entire pie was about 4 inches thick. The crust was 0.25 inches, the sauce 0.25 inches, and (I'm not kidding) about 3.5 inches of disgusting, low quality cheese was piled on top. And they charged almost $50 for it.\n\nIt didn't end there. To try to make up for the horrible heartburn suffered from room service, I looked for a coffeemaker or some other device to make tea. None in the room. I called Room Service, and they wanted $4 to \""deliver\"" it to me. \n\nWe asked them not to clean our room. They called 3 separate times to confirm this, and then started to clean our room at 11:30 PM when we were out!!! And when we complained, no one cared.\n\nAria should rename itself Kafka, because the cold indifference of the staff was really the icing on the cake. In the most contrived tone they could possibly muster, the front desk pretended to care about my terrible stay. With SO MANY better hotels in Vegas, don't make the same mistake I did and choose Aria."
0,"This place is horrible if you're sent here by your employer for a work injury, just go to the emergency room or your own doctor.  The staff here is rude,  you literally wait for hours to he seen.  Dr.  Klausner will delay getting you xrays, mris and anything that costs extra just to save money,  and he will try to send you back to work while your still in pain or still injured.  Avoid pain and aggravation,  go somewhere else."
1,"Been visiting this location for years. The staff is always friendly, the store is almost always in order and things are easy to find. Never had a single problem here. Love them."
1,"I always thought I was not like every other girl and adored shoes more than anything else. \nI was wrong\nI took a walk with my sweetie down the corridor of Wynn very late last night for some window shopping while we were killing time.\nI was just like a kid looking through the store of a puppy shop, wanting so badly to adopt the little shoes that so desperately needed its partner and a good pedicure and a loving home that would keep them in the box until they were needed.\nYes I just compared shoes to animals. I have the fever.\nBlahnik, Louboutin, Choo, Chloe, all the good stuff that a girl needs. \nBoys, drop your girlfriend off here, give her a couple hundred, and you will be safe to play poker for as long as your little heart desires...."
0,"My experience here was horrible. The water for my pedicure was cold and the eye brow wax was less than thorough. Also, they only accept cash tips which caught me by surprise. I will not be returning.  \n\nIf anyone out there has a great nail place, I'd like to know."
1,It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.
0,"After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer."
1,"I will write a more detailed review later on if I ever try something other than the Cuban sandwich, but it is so good I have flashbacks to when I lived in Florida and had the real deal Cuban food there.  I always get the Cuban and the sweet fried plantains, which are totally addictive.  Oh, and an ice cold Negra Modelo.  \n\nAs I was leaving the last time I heard another customer say, \""That was the best mojito I've ever had!\""  so I know what I'm trying the next time I go back.   I'll really try to branch out from the Cuban sandwich, but the bread is perfect, the pork is fall-apart tender & flavorful, the ham is tasty and moist, and the blend with mustard and pickles is the way it should be.  Perfection.\n\nI need to learn the name of the regular server I have too.  She is always friendly and funny.  We have been about a half dozen times, and have never been disappointed."
1,"so I ate here 3 nights in a row.  impressed with the variety of pizza & how they list the cooking temp.  I enjoyed the Chicago thin-crust which was cracker-thin.  the cheese, meats, sauces  & vegis are grand.  Woohoo! As good as it gets bar.  &  the food prices are good enough that I don't have to do happy hour.  twice I ordered a pizza & enjoyed the rest for breakfast.  returning in April & will eat here at least 3 times.  I need to try the fries, calamari & Stromboli"
0,"Seating at late evening was poorly done as no hastiest was there to seat you.  We were told sit where you want;  after 10 min, the waiter for that area said he was getting off and we needed to move.  Pricy for what you get, will look elsewhere next time I'm in town."
0,"If you're going to book an appointment, do it by phone or in person. During our trip my fiance and I booked 2 massages online and got a confirmation for it. When we went to the actual spa, the receptionist could only find one appointment. We didn't have extra time in our schedule that day to book another appointment for a few hours later, and if we tried to change the current appointment they would charge us an extra 50%. While my fiance and I debated what to do (we were insisting that the other person get the massage), the receptionist apparently found this very amusing and was laughing. Extremely unprofessional. The spa was suppose to be relaxing but this was the exact opposite experience. I was too pissed off for a massage at that point and went back up to the room. Later my fiance said the massage was only average. Overall I'm very disgusted by this experience. Based on the the rave reviews, if they can fix their pathetic web-based reservation system, it might be worth a $200 massage. For the time being, find relaxation elsewhere or get your reservation in person/ over the phone."
0,"Terrible gym, bad hours, close entire gym for maintenance without warning, lots of staff that do nothing because weights always everywhere, so many people there you have to wait for everything...good reviews here only for price which is pretty good."
0,"Pretty bad. Both the wife's and my steaks were over cooked. Mine was well done (ordered rare) and hers was well (from a medium order). The waiter told us it was the lighting before finally conceding. The two tables next to us sent their food back too. Waiter reached across wife and forked her steak to put on a plate to take back... Not top tier service by any means. \n\nManager offered us a side dish as an apology... We declined. So much for a special dinner. The one and only time Flemings has messed up a steak they comp'd.  But that's probably because it's so rare that it happens there, clearly not the case at Chris's. Pretty sad, nowhere near the hype. For $100/ea (no drinks) I'd expect better service and better quality food."
1,"In-n-Out by far sets the bar above the rest of all fast food. The employees exude customer service, clean uniforms, and great food. Could this because this company believes is paying their employees more than a minimum wage?  Could be a big factor.  It is proof that if you take care of your employees, they will take care of the business."
0,"This is a $hit hole w bunch of \""I just turned 21 woot woot\""ers in slutty attires obnoxiously drunk running around.  The service is bad. Very bad. (I waited for my drinks forever ...). I see they tried to modernize & dazzle up the place ending in vain.\n\nU get 20% automatic surcharge for everything here though service is usually below average.\n\nThe club here on Friday night was rather empty...kind of a joke.  Yes I do see they tried to stuff the place w servers/dancers w fake boobies but they got no personality what's so ever. Performances are mediocre.\n\nOverall this place deserves one star."
0,"The patio was nice,  but don't expect to get good service when you sit there. Took over 15 mins before we got our drinks even ordered.  Everyone finished our drinks before our lunch order was take.  An hour later the food finally came out. It wasn't really hot and looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The server said they had a large party come in. So she was spending her time with them and forgot out the people outside. There was 4 tables outside and we all complained.  The food was not worth the wait"
0,"Came here this past Veterans Day weekend.  The woman needed her Asian food fix.  I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine.  Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish.  Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better."
0,"Sushi Wow is officially the worst sushi bar in town from a level of customer service. I used to love this place and lately I have had one bad experience after another. I have gone there several times and they weren't open for business even though their business hours are clearly posted on the front door. The owner has a shitty attitude especially toward customers who have been patronizing his business for a long time. If you want your business to improve, start with your attitude.Most sushi bars don;t have the best selection of wine but who goes to sushi bar looking for good wine right! I'll settle for a glass of wine that's not spoiled....SMH!!!!!!!!!!!! They poured me the last glass of wine they had which was obviously refrigerated weeks too long. I asked for another glass but like I said...IT WAS THE LAST OF THE WINE THEY HAD. On another visit, the sushi chef made me a roll that was amazing so I decided to order it again for lunch the following day until the owner informed me that he the check couldn't make that roll anymore. Shame on me for going back. They have these jalapeno poppers that are to die for so I figured that I would order to go. When I arrived to pick up the order, no greeting and was told that a side of Siracha was $1........ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\n\nSO DONE WITH THIS PLACE. THEY WON'T GET A DIME OF MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAND HE WONDERS WHY HIS BUSINESS IS STRUGGLING."
1,"I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  \n\nThe fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  \n\nThey have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!\n\nEnjoy"
1,"Lovely, little place in a cool strip mall filled with neat businesses. Two medium sized portions were $10.82. My almond and bacio (hazelnut chocolate) was delish and filled with nuts. The almond tasted like almond butter but so much better; no extract here. Boyfriend had lemon gelato and sorbet, enjoyed both, finished his way faster than I finished mine. Clean, neat operation with pleasant employees."
1,"They have finished the renovation of the driving range and it's fantastic! On one side they have the normal hitting stations where you can get balls from a dispenser. On the other side is a double decker range which is all automated. You pay and get a ticket inside, input the number into the computer at your station, and it automatically tees up each ball for you. You can put the ball on the mat if you don't want it teed up and you can also adjust the tee height to match the club you are using. It will bring the next ball at the same height until you change it. The best turf driving range around!! Check it out!"
0,"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner last night because I had a Chinese food craving and thought it would be good to try something new. Honestly, I wasn't impressed at all. Forget hitting the spot, the food here didn't even get anywhere near the spot.\nFirstly, the place is pretty small and has a rather weird layout. We were seated at a table near the bar and man, did the sound of the bartender shaking up drinks get annoying! It was so loud that I had trouble hearing my boyfriend a couple times.\nNo sooner were we seated than the waitress asked us if we wanted to start off with any appetizers. I mean, at least give us a chance to look at the menu! Other than that, she was very attentive and courteous so I'll give them points for service. \nWe ordered the steamed pork pot stickers, which were pretty decent. For entrees, I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and my boyfriend had the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles. The Kung Pao chicken was disgusting. Firstly, it was not spicy at all, even though it's marked as spicy on their menu. The chicken wasn't marinated and tasted like boiled chicken covered with sauce. The Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles were much better, although nothing really worth writing home about.\nI'm never going back. I'd much rather eat at places that focus one thing and master it rather than being a Jack of all trades and trying their hand at everything from Chinese and Thai to Spanish and Tapas."
0,"Absolutely one of the worst businesses I have had the misfortune of interacting with.  This company lost one of my items and promised to replace it.  Weeks later and numerous phone calls later, they never did.  Instead, they got angry at me for coming in!\n\nThings happen, items get lost, sometimes things go less than smoothly...that's understandable, as long as the company does its best to fix the problem.  Magic Touch did the exact opposite, acted dishonestly, and treated me and my time with utter contempt and complete disrespect.  \n\nI would not wish interacting with this company on my worst enemy."
0,"We used to order from them all the time but then we quit because of customer service. So we decided a few years later to try again. Well we were welcomed back to the same old bad customer service. Let me explain, we ordered an order of the chicken fingers special meal deal and pizza. When the order was delivered we got pizza and a order of chicken fingers and fries (which is only 5 or 6 fingers and small portion of fries). After being told it would only be 30 to 40 minute delivery the order did not arrive until well over an hour. When order arrived it was Not even close to what was ordered over phone. We called to complain and the person on the other end of the phone understood our frustration or so I thought. He sent our new delivery out and it got here about 35 to 40 minutes later. I was giving the driver 15 dollars more to cover the difference but was told that it wasn't enough. So I called tropicana pizza and talked to them and the person on the other end of the phone would not give an inch or listen to me. They were way late and had order wrong in the first place but yet he would not help out the customer whatsoever. I do not recommend this place as they have gone horribly down hill since the old tropicana pizza. What a joke they have become!!"
0,"I'll be up front - I've never eaten here before.  Right before they changed locations, we had read so many great things on yelp that we had to go there.  We walked in and immediately got a whiff of something truly nasty - there must have been a back up in their sewer because it smelled awful.  We turned on our heels and headed out the door.  We tried to give it another chance but they were in the middle of moving locations.  Does anyone know the scoop on why they moved?  Did it have something to do with that hideous smell?  \n\nWe're excited to actually eat here but need reassurances that the new place smells better."
1,"My boyfriend and I are Total Rewards members and used our comps to stay at the Rio. Our stay was November 5 to the 10th. I paid $67 for the whole week. I gave 4 stars because this was our first time staying at this hotel and can't compare it to any previous stays there.\n\nWe flew in on the 4th and check-in isn't until 4 p.m. the next day. We decided to try anyway and learned we would have to pay a hundred something for Friday since their cycle doesn't start over till the check-in time. That was okay. I had family living 20 minutes away whose house we could crash at. The young lady who assisted us at the counter was very pleasant.\n\nFast forward to 4 p.m. The young lady that helped us the night before was still working! Poor thing. But it was a gentleman who checked us in and was just as pleasant. We chose not to get an upgrade of a renovated room with a view of the strip. Our suite was in the Masquerade Tower on the eighth floor. It was a pretty large size. After walking taking a tour of the room, I sat down on the bed and realized the pictures on the website did not match what we have. The photos on the website were of the renovated rooms. I couldn't really complain, especially for $67. We still did have a view of the strip, though. (See attached photo). The couch was a little tattered on one corner. The drain in the shower was slow draining. One end of the towel rack on the shower door fell off when I hung a towel, but was easily fixed. TV is old school style. Still, I cannot complain. We were mostly happy with having a refrigerator and the room was clean. Housekeeping did a good job whenever we asked for room service. She even gave us extra shampoo and soap eventhough we weren't really using them. I ordered in-room breakfast and the man who served us was very nice. \n\nI would definately stay here again."
0,Saturday night November 2nd 2013 my sons 21 birthday we had a blast I got a room on the strip so no one had to drive all my son wanted to do was smoke hookah yelp says this is the place to go the website says open till 3 I called to make sure they were open we walked pretty far to get there arrived at 1am and we were met at the door by a very bitchy lady stating they were closed as loud music blared in the background and you could see people sitting inside I was livid she was really nasty about it too I was just about to click the check in button until she spoke I will never go back and I know the people that were with us will never go back either
0,Stay away frm here! Save your $ and go some place else. I'm sitting in the buffet as i write this.  I was expecting alot frm the revs and i'm def not a picky eater by no means. The food here is mediocre at best. The sushi rolls are terrible. The crab legs are way salty. The dessert is jst ok. I would def not come back here. RIP OFF!
0,"Nice casual atmosphere....\n\nHowever the food was underwhelming to say the least.   If I was eating in a airport cafe or a 3 star hotel lobby, the food would be decent.   It was plain boring and lacked any intensity.\n\nService....Bleah!\n\nSerious WP, do you just want to say you have a bunch of restaurants in Vegas or do you really care what your restaurants are actually serving?   I get it.  Tourist trap, lots of foot traffic....easy money.  Yeah you don't care."
0,"How many bad reviews a place can get before they make some changes.???\n\nCave creek has so many good restaurants, so we often make the drive in to town without a plan of where are we going, we get here and figure it out.. We decided to give this place a try (did not consulted with yelp). \n\nThe service was not the greatest, our server would hangout at the bar and every once in a while look over to see if we would wave her down.\nThe food was ok for a bar.. Not so much for a restaurant. (Maybe it was my mistake it is called the tap house after all)\nAs far as the ambiance goes, well it is like an oversize bar pretending to be a restaurant. \nWriting this review I realized that the owner wanted to have a bar but opened a restaurant.... Maybe that is why the place is more than 3/4 empty all the time..\n\nThere is hope.. But it will require a lot of work for this place to make it back.."
1,Two words: KIDS SUITE!\n\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!
0,"So I came in to this restaurant thinking it be exactly like the ones from home. But nothing like California farmer burgers. I order a jalape\u00f1o burger thinking it be as advertises but so wrong was missing lettuce, tomatoes, onions and not to mention their register people should be more welcoming and be able to offer something different. Or be greeted with would you like to try , so this will be last time I come here"
1,"I'm a huge boba fanatic and Boba Tea House does not disappoint. Granted i haven't been to a boba place yet that i didn't finish my entire tasty beverage smiling. They have an endless variety of flavors and mixtures to choose from and even delicious snacks foods. The staff is friendly and more the willing to help you make the right decision for that flavor your looking for. Not gonna say it's my favorite boba spot, only cause the decor has this bare wherehouse motif going on, but it's definitely worth going to if your in the neighborhood and want a quick fix."
0,"I've been to Cyclo twice. The first time was great. The food and service was really good. Pretty reasonably priced. Really loved the fact that you could bring your own wine. Went back about a year later. Again, food was great. The garlic green beans as good as I remember. Pretty good service. The owner was there again in another cute little dress (sorry, but I notice that kind of shit). Liked the check holders had customer graffiti all over them (more dumb shit I notice). Finished the wine and meal, hit up the bathroom before leaving. Only one and it was occupied. Fine, it's a small place I understand. Wait a bit, then our spiky haired waiter comes out. He gives me a shifty look, which I didn't understand. I Immediately get it once I make my way in and look at the toilet. Didn't even put the seat up. Piss everywhere. I was so mad. Unfortunately, the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time I came out. F'n disgusting. I hate to judge the place by one waiter, but feel like if they are gonna let this ahole work here, can't help but think what else they might be letting slide.  \nSorry, won't be back."
1,"I find this place to be MIND BLOWING. The food is insanely original and innovative, for example, my girlfriend had chicken and waffles. And while the menu item doesn't sound so enthusiastic in the description, what ended up on our table was 4 pieces of syrup drenched fried chicken piled high and speared into waffle cakes, stuffed with BACON!\n\nBacon! Stuffed into a WAFFLE! Can you imagine that?\n\nSome crazy shit here!\n\nThe service is slow, but it's understandable. At the time we arrived to eat here, our waitress was serving 7 tables in the early morning. She can alternate between Spanish and English (she's Caucasian), and had some unruly tables full of grumpy, whiney old people to deal with. 7 tops is ALOT of people to feed. So we had to give her credit for keeping her cool under pressure.\n\nThe atmosphere inside, versus outside the Plaza casino was just as significant as The Griffin bar on 6th street and Fremont. You have your shady fuckers bumming around and looking for change outside the casino (Fremont happens to be a major place for bums to mill about, and also is the drop off point for newly released inmates from the Clark County and City jails at the Golden Nugget valet), and then you got the more sociable folks coming inside to eat. \n\nSecurity and the staff do a good job to keep trouble out, if not appearing to be overworked."
1,"The Center recently moved from a tiny, sort of run-down location to a brand-new, absolutely beautiful building. With the move, The Center is still providing their appreciated services to the community, and can now expand to offer even more.\n\nAt The Center, anyone can get STD testing for free, no matter your sexuality. The process is fast with short wait times, and everyone is incredibly professional and nice. They can even draw blood without hurting you or making you cry, as I'm afraid of needles - mega perk. It's hard to beat staying safe for zero cost out of pocket.\n\nOn the other side of things, The Center offers free computer use and internet access, and now has a growing library that people can use for free. They offer support meetings, throw fun fundraising events, and specifically make sure kids and teens have a private, \""just them\"" space to call their own. I also hear they have a bomb cafe for lunch.\n\nThe Center is doing great work for the Vegas community. Get tested!"
0,I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews But when you walk in it smells of fish which isn't good The sushi wasn't that great they forgot one of the things we ordered and the service is TERRIBLE they said they were busy but there was 3 other tables of 2 people at each. Never coming back again that's for sure
1,"AHHHH - I LOVE THIS PLACE.\nWhenever someone goes to Phoenix, I always tell them to hit up Culinary Dropout.\n\nFood - \nBest Prime Rib Dip Sandwich in the US.  Love it, can't order anything else.\n\nDrinks - \nMarg on the rocks with a shot of Guinness Beer.  Can't even thinking about having margs any other way any more."
0,"When I moved to Charlotte, (being a BBQ fan) I was excited that a BBQ place was so close to my new apartment. It didn't take long for us to head over to try out Sonny's. Unfortunately I discovered that we'll have to search a little more to find great BBQ. It wasn't bad, but my fiance and I were both unimpressed. We don't eat out that much, so when we do, we want to make sure that it's really worth the trip. Unfortunately, this place wasn't and I am still on the search for that great BBQ place in Charlotte."
1,"An unexpected treat from my \""auntie\"" from France and a nice gesture by an employee to move my cane-assisted 'uncle\"" to the front of the long line got Saturday evening started right.  Well, almost right because I hadn't been preparing all day for a buffet...\n\n(Ironically, the seater then made us walk, uncle and all, all the way to the back corner of the place.)\n\nDecent amount of variety, although a lot of it wasn't premium buffet stuff. King crab and prime rib were obviously the best picks overall, but I liked a lot of the other dishes, including the 4th of July special pulled beef with baked beans, the lamb kebobs and baba ghanouj, the fried shrimp (overly battered but still good), the italian sausage... mmm. Desserts were good too, especially the creme brulee and apple pie for me. Also, that frozen custard just somehow tastes different from the usual frozen yogurt...\n\nOverall, it was a great meal, but not quite an unforgettable variety of victuals.\n\nP.S. A foursquare check-in at the proper Planet Hollywood Resort can get you $5 off for this buffet."
1,"Loved it! I was visiting from NYC with a few friends, and we decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!"
0,"First and foremost, buyer beware. I did not end up doing business with this company, but I thought I should write a review here to let others know WHY I chose not to do business with them. Andy did a drive-by estimate for removal of a palm tree and stump grinding. Before he did the estimate, he told me over the phone that it would probably cost at least $300, which is right around what multiple other bonded and insured arborists had been quoting me at for the same service. When he came out to my property, he quoted me at $650-- over double the price of most of the bids that I got for this job. Furthermore, he tried to tell me that I should try to sell my palm tree, which anyone with experience in this field should know is NOT possible because there isn't at least 2' of space around the base of the tree-- it's outgrown its planter and needs to be cut down. That didn't exactly speak volumes to me about his knowledge of tree removal. To be honest, between his astronomical bid and his naive suggestion, I got the impression that this company is pretty shady. That may not be the case, but I'm not taking my chances."
1,"Everything was great here....EXCEPT THE STEAK!! I ordered a 10 oz filet mignon medium rare with truffle butter and it was overcooked. It seemed more like a medium to medium well. Since this is a steak house, I had to take off points for overcooking the steak. \n\nI had the garden salad and our table shared broccolini, spiced maple carrots, and the lobster mac and cheese. Delicious. \n\nThe service was great. The ambiance and music was fantastic. But seriously?? If I'm paying that much for a steak, grill it the way I want it."
0,"Hotel needs to be updated. Upon arrival to our room we opened the door and the smell of weed smacked us in the face. The safe had an old pair of old stinky loafers. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it took forever to rinse out my hair. The room was not very clean. Trying to park close to the tower you were in was a cluster. Rooms were cheap, but like they say \""you get what you pay for\""  definitely will not stay at this hotel again."
1,"These Guys just get it right,great burgers straight forward toppings hand cut fries.I've eaten here on more than a few occasions with the family and everyone loves it.Counter service is always polite and expeditious .Enjoy."
0,"I really wanted to like Bonterra. I really REALLY wanted to enjoy it...but it was just disappointing. My husband and I ordered a variety of items off the menu - an array of appetizers, entrees and wine and nothing really \""wowed\"" us. The worst part of it all, though, was the service. Maybe the server was just having an off night, but he was very short with us, only checked on us twice during the entire time (once was to greet and the second was to drop off the check with no thank you whatsoever). Other servers dropped off our food (which is completely fine)...but the whole experience was a let down. When you spend that kind of money on a meal ($200+) you really want to be taken care of - and it seemed like no one cared at all."
1,"I work in the same strip mall as this store so I come here often. Starbucks has excellent service, the deli is fast and the sandwiches are truly deli good, KJ at the pharmacy is just about the coolest pharmacist I've met, and I've never had any issues checking out with my groceries."
1,"WAIT WAIT WAIT.......... 5 stars for food and beer only @ the BBQ restaurant next to the brewery...\n\nOK, Ellis Island is a dump of a casino, it looks old but it has three things going for it...........BBQ baby back ribs, BBQ chicken and onsite brewed beer. They cook the ribs in the parking lot as you enter from Koval.\n\nThey brew their own (multiple beers). $1.75 for an 20 ounce glass...... And they make (non alcoholic) root beer too............... I'm hooked on the lite beer.\n\nOK, here is my humble opinion. I can drop a $100+ bucks easily on myself for dinner at the right place 7 days a week if I wanted to. I just wanted to be clear that I'm not cheap.\n\nEllis Island was mentioned to me about two years ago and I finally went in June 2011. I'm not a fan of BBQ because I don't like the mess and usually the lack of meat on the rib bones. You WON'T have that problem here. For $13, you can get at least an 18 inch+ rack of baby backs, (BBQ beans, slaw, bread and corn on the cob very average). You can also get a rib/chicken combo. There is a pizza place within spitting distance that serves great pizza by the slice that you can bring to the table (our appetizer).\n\nI CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK........... And I'll get two racks of ribs next time because they were that damn good and cheap.\n\nBEWARE, IT'S POPULAR, SMALL AND THERE WILL BE A WAIT. SO DRINK UP!!!!\n\nFYI, It's behind Bally's to the east."
0,This place is very small. I had to wait for 1hr to be seated.  The food was not the best because the grill was not working. I think I ate raw pork and chicken because the grill was messed up. There was so much smoke coming from our grill that they didn't brother to fix it after we were done eating raw meat. Place was too small and not worth going even if the price was cheap.
0,"I don't know if 1 star is right or 2, but it's pretty close.  I think it would have been an easy 2 stars if I didn't go to George's Brasserie the night after to compare this against.\n\nFirst off, the waiter was off. I don't mind that perhaps English wasn't his first language, but there are somethings that do matter.  Like getting your napkin halfway through the appetizers is a little strange.  We were needing some space on the table because me and buddies ordered a lot of food.  It took a really long time for the waiter to come by and clear the dishes  - since it was him who noted the crowded tabletop.  Also, when we got the dessert menu, it literally took him like over ten minutes to come back and get an order from us.  It's wild, but the way the waiter is will really set the tone for the evening.\n\nSecond, the food was not good.  I couldn't help but notice some post here claiming that oysters are really good.  Frankly, I'm no oyster aficionado, but after comparing with other restaurant, it was pretty weak.  In comparison to other oyster bars in the area, they were much to liquid-y. That is, they just didn't have enough substance on the whole and also, the taste wasn't really like seawater, it was more salt water than anything. Fairly disappointed in the oysters. Second, the mussel pot had a pretty good broth, but the mussels were far too small and you could easily tell that they were old/frozen.  The mussels tended to be a bit grainy and fall apart in the mouth.  The sushi was definitely standard and didn't pop out at me at all. Admittedly, the sweet'n'sour calamari or something like that was pretty good, but that's the extent of it.\n\nThird, the ambiance made me feel tired. Lights are too dim and not very crowded.\n\nYeah, I won't be coming back, sorry.  Waiter really set the tone for the night and the food didn't do anything to recover. If I want oysters/mussels, I'll go to another place.\n\ndmo out."
1,"I have been going to this Chipotle for about two year now. Love Chipotle!! Most of the time to get the food to go. The quality and quantity of the food has not changed at all. Everything is fresh and delicious every time. I get my usual, burrito with chicken, black bean, rice, cheese, and a little sour cream. Add a bag a chips (whatever fall out of the burrito is scooped up by the chips. YUM! We just went tonight."

I like the pashmina selection- quite affordable, but really not the type of store to write home about as their seem to be a lot of similar little shops about."

0,"I flew into Las Vegas for a business trip back on January 9, 2013.  After reading favorable reviews on one-star hotels and motels, I decided to stay here at the Crestwood Suites right off of Las Vegas Boulevard, just a few minutes south from the strip.  While being able to get good night's rest on my one-night stay, the room and its facilities have their fair share of pros and cons.\n\nOn the positive side, the place has a very nice price point, basic amenities and friendly customer service.  Reserving via Priceline's website, not utilizing the \""name your own price\"" service, the daily rate of $58 per night was affordable.  The room has all of the basic amenities, like shampoo, soap, iron and iron board, etc.  There's even a stove, refrigerator, cabinets and sink.  And also for a local hotel to have a good caliber of customer service, concern and interaction, at least that brought a lot of ease in my mind.\n\nHowever, I believe all those pluses don't cover up the two drawbacks of this place.  First off is the presence of the remnant secondhand cigarette smoke in the hallway and my room, which is on the first floor wing.  On top of hotel patrons, I personally couldn't believe how maids could make a living cleaning the rooms with this \""stench\"" of a smell present.  Plus it personally sucks to have my clean clothes be adored with this type of smell!  Also, the room sofa has that small, yet disgusting, dry white stain sort of similar to Monica Lewinsky's \""blue dress.\""\n\nDespite these findings, the hotel is okay to stay in.  My recommendation for those who want to \""roll the dice\"" by saving your money and their lungs, request a different room higher than the first floor or look somewhere else."

0,"Well... Third Time.. Not a charm. I have been to this place three times now and each time I'm more unimpressed than the last. And today will be my last! We were given a 25 minute wait time for 3 at 10:00am.... At 11:15 we finally got sat.  At 11:30 a waitress gave us a warm pitcher of water and some dirty glasses with no ice and diddnt even think to ask if we were ready to order and when she finally returned 11 minutes later we ordered the traditional Benedict, the ot style Benedict and the green flannel... The Benedict's come with No sides mind you, so we ordered the potatoes and bacon as sides to split as well. it was then as I was looking around the place I noticed in the window hanging for all to see in it's shame....  A THIRTY NINE MINUTE TICKET TIME!!! In a breakfast place! And a small one at that!!??? How is that even possible the ingredients are egg, breads, bacon, quick breakfast meats and veggies! How is it that long!  It is NOT a huge place! 45 minutes later when we got our food let me tell you how UN-WORTH IT this place is. Now where do I start on the complaints.... it came looking like my own at home attempts on eggs Benedict rather than a $12.50 made to order in a breakfast establishment eggs Benedict. For both of the Benedict's the hollandaise was cold, congealed and also very grainy. The Benedict that wore the name of the restaurant \"" the OT style\"" ... Came with a tablespoon sized crumble of rubbery chorizo, 3 thinly cut and obviously sparingly used avocado slices all on top of a UNTOASTED, COLD, english muffin. The situation was the same with the traditional Benedict. the green flannel had potential if it hadn't come out overcooked and rubbery . The waitress did nothing and seemed like she had expected the meals malfunctions  and when my dad stopped her for the second time to complain she brought me an extra greasy side of overcooked chorizo for my Benedict... THIS PLACE GETS AN F! Failed in service, failed in ambiance, failed in handling customer complaints,  failed in food, failed in taste... Which is sad because this place has potential.  But I'm not willing to come back after this experience."
1,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR COLAVANDA & ZORAN!!!\n\nMy apologies if their name is misspelled! Anyways, shout out to these 2 security from Marquee Day Club. I was there Sunday June 23, 2013. I had a friend who was too drunk to stay at the pool party. Despite how annoying & uncooperative my friend was, C & Z were very patient & did not give us attitude or seemed annoyed where as other security probably would have. Eventually my friend got himself together & they both escorted us out to get a cab to take back to our hotel. I tried to give them tip but they generously declined (you guys totally deserved it btw). Thanks again!"
1,"Vietnamese Sandwiches: The only thing I go here for, To be honest this is the best Vietnamese sandwiches in Las Vegas, trust me. Not like Lee's Sandwiches. Hue Thai bakes their bread fresh so when you get your sandwiches the breads soft and a little bit crunchy but still a little warm. I've tried a couple places and this place has to be the best. \n\nOther foods: They have a variety of Vietnamese dishes, Chinese, and even Thai. But nothing taste super Authentic. So that's why I never order anything there except the Vietnamese sandwiches and their boba (which is decent). Not a fan of their Pho\n\nPrice: Vietnamese Sandwiches here are dirt cheap, $3.50 a sandwich I believe. Only sucky thing is they require a minimum of $20 to charge a debit card. Which you should know by now, I'm a yelper who doesn't like to carry cash.\n\ntake out/eat there: To be honest dining there isn't so bad, other than the odd smell of cleaning products and food mixed together and the eye sore hallway to the bathroom the place is pretty alright. The design I guess is some kind of under the sea theme? I have no idea why its under the sea that has nothing to do with Vietnamese food. \n\n4/5 Stars for Price/Vietnamese Sandwiches/ Decent Boba"
0,"I have been a CVS customer for years, I moved close to this pharmacy, Honestly at first the pharmacy techs upset me but now I am used to the awkward lack of customer service. I am happy that after months of asking they now apply my 25 dollar discount card. Well I don't take no for an answer anymore, I could change locations but [why I am having laser surgery done to my back so hopefully I will not need to go there every month.  Maybe try another place, But if it is best for you, Just stand your ground.\n\n***update*** I dropped\nThis place. The jerks finally pushed me over\nThe edge months ago. I moved\nMy scripts over to Walmarts pharmacy . I have not had an issue since."
0,"Stopped here never reading reviews or anything about the place... It looked nice and classy so I figured it would be awesome. Our waitress, Sharon just wasn't pleasant at all... She slammed our drinks and plates down. Then we asked for more bread and she said \""well I'll have to charge you\"" so that is fine but when she gave us the basket it only had two small pieces in it, which before each basket had about 4, so that was kinda crappy. Then one of us ordered another beer and she poured it and just let it over flow all onto the table and didn't even say a word.  The crab in the stuffed mushroom app and the stuffed shrimp dinner has mostly imitation crab in it, which for the price is just unacceptable. I had just plain fettuccine Alfredo and it was great I ate the whole thing....  The lighting is just so bright and it's around dinner so I don't want to be under a heat lamp during dinner... I'm not sure if I'd go back ...."
1,"Another successful transplant from NYC, this place is great.  Spendy, trendy, and a little confusing menu wise if you have a big group like we did.  we had a great waiter that helped us with our order and nobody left disappointed or un-full.  The place is loud and full of energy and beautiful people.\n\nAsk for help with the menu if theres a group.  If youre a couple youre golden.  So many things to try, you could eat here 100 times.\n\nNo complaints at all."
1,"Why did I wait so long to try Dickey's?  \n\nMy husband and I visited Dickey's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The smoked meats on the menu are pretty straight forward, pulled pork, beef brisket, sausage, ham, turkey and chicken - all hickory smoked in their onsite pits. Now, I know I'm in North Carolina where pulled pork is king, but I can't pass up brisket. I ordered a 1 meat plate with beef brisket. The plate comes with 2 sides and I chose the baked potato casserole and the fried onion tanglers.  Boy, did I choose right!  You get a hefty portion of meat with a soft roll with pickles and onions. You can also choose from a variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  My husband also got the brisket but got the jalapeno beans and fried okra.  He said he really liked his plate too.  The brisket was tender with a nice smokey flavor. I chose the original bbq sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment.  And to top it all off, everyone gets free soft-serve vanilla ice cream!  It's self serve and it was a great ending to a really great lunch!\n\nThe service was super, super nice and attentive. I've been plotting our next visit. We will definitely be back!  The bakers (stuffed baked potatoes) will be next on my list!"
0,"Nothing about this hotel rises above mediocre. Rooms are aging fast and staff service is about what you'd expect  from a typical DMV. They may choose to do their job, but they definitely won't \""help\"" in any sense of the word.\n\nThe whole hotel is about a decade and a half past it's prime (if it ever had one). I only stayed here because it was the designated lodging for a conference at the hotel. Never again."
0,"Often, amenable accommodations can be soured by an incompetent staff that ruins one's stay, or potential stay. Some might say that one should not give so much weight to service, and instead ignore it and enjoy the space created by architect humans at some recent point of our species' history for the sole purpose of potential enjoyment by other humans. \n\nI think that the staff at Crowne Plaza Hotel - Phoenix should be maligned. Not merely maligned; but, summarily fired. All of those humans: fired. \n\nStaff is rude. And incompetent. And -- worst of all -- disrespectful. \n\nFire them! Fire them all."
0,"Judging by the 5-star reviews this place has I can come to only 1 conclusion.... the people reviewing this place have NO concept of good sushi.\n\nI've been here a few times, most recently for the $18.95 All-You-Can-Eat sushi deal.  The AYCE deal is a rip off.  They only let you order 3 items at a time, have a very limited menu to choose from, take 20-25mins between orders, and they physically make the sushi different.... meaning when they fill an AYCE order they give you a huge lump of rice topped with a razor thin slice of fish.  When you order from the non AYCE menu they serve a proper nigiri.  Bullshit.\n\nNon-AYCE speaking their food is nothing to get excited about.... their rolls are sloppy and are boring.  The fish is not that good and frankly didn't taste of superior quality.  The atmosphere is loud, bright, and full of televisions.\n\nIf you have never left Gilbert and think Safeway has \""bomb sushi\"", well you will be in heaven here.... otherwise you would be well advised to seek sushi somewhere else."
1,Didn't get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l.. really cool laid back feel. I think the whole design and the lighting. Service was really good. Will come back soon to check out the food.
1,"One of the few Bolognese Sauces with NO Cream, YAY!!!  My server asked me with much skepticism and disgust \""Who puts Cream in their Bolognese!\""  I knew I had found an Italian Restaurant I would like... Wish the Sauce had more Herbs... ONLY Freshly Grated Parmesan to garnish, I asked if they had the powdered kind?  I HATE the powdered kind!  Thankfully my Server again could not believe I had been treated so poorly in so many so-called \""Itailian\""  Establishments using that disgusting \""powdered\"" version of Parmesan!\n\nThe Bread is Obviously House Made and Fantastic... the Butter is obviously real and \""Land of Lakes\""...\n\nTiramisu - maybe the only Dessert they make in House... This one was VERY Special and I'm no fan unless it is really Great!  If you like to taste the different versions, I highly recommend this one!\n\nIntimate, Cozy, about 40 seats, VERY Comfortable, with NONE of the Typical Italian 'tude you can find in so many places claiming Italian...\n\nBetter food than most Italian!\n\nThe Chef/ Owner is from Pisa, though I think she said he grew up here!\n\nMy Server had a Thick German accent, easy to understand, though I could not figure out where she was from!"
1,My husband and I bought a house recently and we only had a few days before the furniture was coming and we wanted it painted.  Michael came to meet us and give a quote.  We ended up choosing him and we could not be happier.  The process was painless and our house came out great.   Like others have said you pay for the paint as a deposit and you pay him the difference at the end of the job.  \n\nExcellent communication throughout the process. I could not believe how fast they were able to get the job done. \n\nHighly recommend them!
0,"For me, the menu choices were not that different from each other; with the exception of the steak, it seemed it all tasted the same. The spices overpowered the food so that my pork dish, tasted like all the others. It wasn't a matter of being too \""hot\"", it was just too much. I've eaten better food at half the price. Do not misunderstand, the food was good, it just wasn't outstanding or worth the money."
0,"Never taking Bruce here again. Only took him once, they never answered my phone calls or returned my phone calls prior to dropping him off. \nOur dog was there for four days and three nights, he was limping when we brought him home because his paws had been blistered so badly from the hot asphalt. They obviously weren't monitored properly. He is now missing chunks of skin and cries when you touch his paws. \nBeware!!!"
1,"Great wings, artichoke dip, and pizza. Great addition to the neighborhood as our other pizza options aren't so good. \nMy only criticism would be the cursive on their online menu. It's very difficult to read and makes me feel illiterate. Other than stirring feelings of inadequacy this will be our go to pizza spot!"
1,"VERDICT: Come for the delicious bread, leave for the atmosphere.\n\nI really like Great Harvest Bread Co.  They do regular sliced bread a service, by making it fresh, preservative free and delicious.  The difference between Great Harvest Bread and Panera is dramatic.  Great Harvest shies away from croissants and danishes.  Instead they focus on white, wheat, and various other basic sliced breads.  They are really good though.  It really makes you detest going back to the normal grocery store fodder.  The downfall, as is with quality, is the price, about $5-$6 per loaf.  They also have cookies and a few bready desserts.\n\nPart deux of this review really has to focus on the experience and atmosphere.  First, I was really excited to find a Great Harvest over by my Costco on Decatur.  I forced Greg to pull over and rush in.  However, there was a group of six or so teenage n'er-do-wells also approaching the store at the same time.  I was determined to get to the store before them and told Greg to hurry or they were going to beat us to the door.  He said, \""don't worry, they'll eat up the free samples and you'll get a fresh loaf to sample\"".  He just said that because he is a lollygagger and hates to \""pick up the pace\"".  I must be getting old since I've already used the terms \""n'er-do-well\"" and \""lollygagger\"" in this post.  Anyway, I let the hooligans beat me to the store.\n\nInside the narrow store, the teenagers turned out to be less of a threat.  It appeared to be closeted gay boys with their Christian-youth-group-approved girlfriends out having a wild time by venturing to the bread store to get a couple of sandwiches and get an inappropriate amount of free samples.  You know, basically being complete rebels.  They were kind of too outwardly excited about their bread samples in a wholesome way, saying things like \""I love bread\"" and \""bread rocks\"".  It was like those Totino pizza roll ads where the kids wax feverishly about their love of frozen food.\n\nThis process actually took a long time, giving me an ample amount of time to give Greg the I-told-you-so eye for being a lollygagger.  Something I'm sure he was oblivious to noticing.  During this time, I was also able to look around at all of the customers sitting at tables.  There were quite a few of them.  I would say at least ten people scattered through the sitting area.  Then it struck me as being incredibly odd.  Every single person was facing the counter.  Every single person was not eating, drinking, or talking.  They were just staring at the counter.  I felt this existential feeling like I was starring in Sartre's \""No Exit\"".  They were the audience and I didn't know that I was in the play.  It was bizarre.  I know, I know, I often accuse restaurants of being cults, as in crEATe and the nearby Salad Creations, but I think I'm on to something. It was odd.  I have no idea what is going on there.\n\nIn any case, I get the counter with my Dakota wheat bread (sooooo gooood).  I get my choice of free samples and the girl behind the counter offered me the heel of the bread.  Those n'er-do-well, hooligan, gays and their beards stole my chance for a decent sample.  And Greg's lollygagging didn't help either."
1,Love this breakfast place! Some of the best breakfast items! You order at the counter and sit wherever available. They definitely need to expand their space and open another location. It's nice they that they cater to vegan and gluten free. Food is excellent -- try anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed.
0,"This place is horrible!!! Can't believe how they are still open!! We went for RW, and what a waste of money and time!!! The only up side was the service, our waiter was very attentive ... But the food was terrible!!"
1,"I've been here over a dozen times and still haven't reviewed it yet. Sort of that \""You don't talk during a meal because it's so delicious\"" - thing?\n\nAnyway,\n\nThe owners and staff here are so freaking nice. Customer Service is such an important element to dining, that a lot of places overlook, and these folks do it well.\n\nTraditional Thai offerings in a very relaxed, clean (thank you), and simple atmosphere.\n\nThis is the only Thai Basil, of the local chains, that makes Pad Prik King and other \""off the menu\"" dishes -  so I keep coming back to this particular location."
1,"I've only been here once but it was a great experience. First; the view of Pittsburgh is amazing! I had the Veggie Strudel and I thought it was amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 instead of 5/5 is that I wish they had more of a mixed drink menu; its really  just wine. We had to ask them to make a certain drink but they were happy to do it. If they make a mixed drink menu, I think they would attract more people. The server was nice, kind of quiet, but nice. I recommend everyone going here!"
1,"As much as it was mentioned in every single tourist guide i could find of Charlotte, this is a homey, family restaurant with soul and a great vibe to it, NOT a tourist-magnet in any way shape of form. The people that work there were down-to-earth and friendly to the core. The service was swift, the mood great, the food delicious. What else to say? Love that place!\n\n\nTIP: Try their fried pickles! Oh my sweet goodness... best culinary surprise I've experienced in years. I was dying to order a second round of them because... wow... they were so good."
0,"*bed bugs* Stayed here for a conference this week. The place is big and they seem to have nice pools and lounge areas, however, our room smelled bad... Like musty and also like smoke. I really was unhappy with the smell. My girlfriends and I stayed in two separate rooms. After the first night one of my gf's woke up with 6-7 bites and was left uncomfortable and itching the entire trip. The second night of our stay ( i was staying in a different room) I was also bit! I went to sleep fine and woke up with two bites on my ankles. Just a side note, we never had the doors open and we were in two separate rooms.  We both sleep with the blankets covering us as well so I have determined that this is most likely a bed bug issue. My last night I was bit again twice and now I'm home and happy to be here. I am frustrated though that I am itching like crazy, just felt dirty yuck! I gave two stars because the facility is nice, but I don't think getting bit is acceptable."
1,I like the idea I like the simple menu been there several times the only downside is once in a while the chicken will be rubbery but that just depends on the chicken I guess
0,"We sat and waited 5min minutes before someone took our drink order. We waited 10 min more before someone took our meal order and we waited for our meal for over 45min, needless to say it never showed up. My coffee cup was never refilled either. After almost an hour we left. The service was horrible and I'm pretty sure our waiter was stoned out of his mind. This place has great potential and good food but it's always a hit or a miss, and more often then not recently is been a complete miss. I recommend you go here if you want to starve and waste your time."
0,"Bad service and bad food.  Let me explain...\n\nWe were staying at Encore and my friend and I decided to come down for a quick snack.  We settled on two orders of sliders.  After being instructed to order from the bar for to-go orders, we did as such (and left a generous tip!).  And so the wait begins...  after about 20 minutes, we inquire about our order.  They then tell us that they had forgotten to put in the order with the kitchen since we ordered from the bar!  After another 20 minutes, they rush out with our order and upon returning to our room, they were stone cold!  Definitely the worst sliders I've ever had!  At $14 an order, I'd expect at least mediocre food...  We weren't offered anything but a quick apology about the \""mix up\"".\n\nNAT cool."
1,"My first time at Crawfords was a great experience. I hate going anywhere for car repair, but these guys made it bearable (I was looking for something better than another place in Mesa I had been to). They brought my car in immediately and raised it, then Brad talked me through what he was seeing to cause the symptoms I was experiencing. Plus he took time to do a quick check and just give me the status on where other parts of the car were, life-wise, which I really appreciated. They were fast and good communicators on repairs and costs. I'll definitely be back."
0,"The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \""no chocolate shake.\"" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!"
0,I ordered the Traditional eggs Benedict. it came out very quickly. The hollandaise sauce lacks traditional taste and actually had a very odd taste. not sure what the odd taste was but it was odd. i requested the hash browns extra crispy which only came out crispy on one side and wasn't even cooked on the bottom so they were basically half cooked and mushy in the middle. yuck! i could only choke down half the plate. the coffee is pretty bitter as well. 1 star and that's being generous.
1,"This place is my guilty pleasure. The food is not really healthy but it tastes so good. I try to stay away from this place but I can't. I have probably tried 3/4 of the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. Chicken fingers, Italian beef, hamburgers, fish, cheese sticks, shrimp, Philly cheese steak are all great. Mild sauce is just like Chicago. The fries are good too, lightly battered and crispy. Prices are very good. Highly recommended."
0,"Nancy Erdmann was very rude and insensitive. I felt rushed.  Sadly, I'm someone that's going through a tough time health wise and I'm just looking for a good doctor to listen and help me.  The search continues..."
0,For nearly $8 for a turkey club i was severely dissapointed when the bread ended up being stale and hard. And you could totally tell that the cheese was the cheap processed american slices type. Walking in it seems like they sacrificed quality food for a showy appearance.

1,"We go to NY 54 at least twice a month.  We love to buy the 18\"" thin crust pizza, and since there are four of us, we have it made with different toppings on each quarter.  They are always happy to make the pizza to our order.  Also, they have a good selection of draft beers - I highly recommend giving those a try.  I did try their margarita, but it did not have enough alcohol content for my liking, although the taste was excellent.  There is also a great selection of desserts, which I always buy and take some home for later!"
0,"terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead."

1,"A relative newcomer to Edinburgh, this unusual restaurant earned a Michelin star in under one year, and deservedly so. The 21212 name derives from the menu, which comprises 2 starters, 1 soup, 2 main courses, 1 cheese course, 2 desserts. At lunchtime you can go for just 2, 3, 4 or 5 courses. There is an extensive wine list, and there are several wines available by the glass also.\n\n\n The food itself comes in some startling combinations which work very well together, and is beautifully presented in a most elegant dining room. The lunchtime portions were fairly small, but by the time you have worked through five courses, you are amply satisfied. The prices are high, but worth it for the quality experience. The house itself is a fine Edinburgh Georgian townhouse magnificently restored to add modernity without spoiling the classical proportions or features. They also have a few bedrooms for those who wish to indulge in a splendid dinner and not have to go home afterwards.\n\n\n A place for a special treat rather than a routine eatery. Reservations are strongly recommended, as it gets booked up far ahead at popular times."
1,"Samosas are crispy, slightly spicy and potato-filled. Delicious for a whopping price of $1. Also a great place to buy spices. Wasn't sure where to find turmeric powder but I found it here."
0,"It is rare for me to give two stars, and I was so disappointed with my food that I had to write a missive on it.  Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food - simple ingredients so not much you can do wrong.  Quite frankly, the worst tasting Chicken Shawarma I have ever tasted.  The chicken meat looked and tasted like it had come preboiled and prepackaged.  Flavorless, and not something I would expect from such an otherwise flavorful dish.  The shredded lettuce likely came from the same vendor McDonalds has, and I don't recall much else except the flavorless echo of a yogurt-based tzaziki.  Falafal is dried up and lack-luster, hummus is dressed up in Israeli fashion with Paprika - but otherwise uninspired.\n\nThis place is open late, every night of the week - and definitely caters to a younger un-discerning crowd that is inebriated and needing to fill their bellies with sustenance.  And the price is right at about $7-$8 for a meal with fries.\n\nCome here if you are trying to avoid a bad hangover, but not if you want quality middle eastern food."
0,"Don't waste your time or money.  Went there on my last morning in LV only because I didn't have time to get to the Paris buffet.  Completely regret that decision and wished I had gone to McDonald's instead.  To make matters worse, they charged $21.99 for \""brunch\"" due to the holiday (it was the day after Thanksgiving) yet outside of a few  SAD salad items, I didn't see any  \""brunch\"" like items.  Coffee was horrible, waiter was mediocre at best, and food was pretty bad (almost as bad as the Sahara's).  If you're not particular about your food, it may be ok for you, but as for me---I'll go to the Paris buffet.  It is by far the best quality for the buck."

0,"Ramen... another food that is new to my palette and is as old as time to my wife's. This review is a summation of what took me a solid week to get out of my wife who is too nice to give something negative without finding the smallest compliment go with it, but who's Japanese pride eventually boils to the surface.\n\nFirst, the good!\nLocation: Easy to get to off the 215 and a small drive from the 15.\nStaff: Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and took the time to explain what was going on and made sure we had all the condiments we needed. Whenever she saw I water getting low she was quick with a refill.\nAtmosphere: Urban chic, but laid back enough to unwind. The modern upbeat Jazz music was a nice change from the norm.\n\nThe bad:\nNow, I know there is always a battle between those who hold authenticity close to their hearts and those who give leeway due to the fact that this is Las Vegas not Japan.\n\nThe wife and I ordered the Tonkatsu, I took mine regular while the wife combo'd it with gyoza and hanjuku egg. The wife's first sip of the broth was followed by a \""that's not right\"" look, but being the cheerful person she is said it tasted good. Upon further hammering by me she said \""The broth is not as 'deep' as it should be.\"" When I kept on asking how she stated \""There isn't that much flavor, there should be more flavor\"" and that she thought she was eating miso sesame ramen, not tonkotsu. She was also put off by the sake like after taste of the hanjuku egg, void of the umami flavor she was expecting.\n\nShe summed it up by saying that she would never bring in a person from Kyushu, where tonkatsu ramen is there pride. When I asked if she would bring in another Japanese person at all she answered with a quick 'no.'\n\nWhat really highlighted how off their broth was when we made the instant tonkotsu she had in the cupboard only a few days later. After tasting that I understood how disappointed my wife was.\n\nSo, was it good soup? Yes.\nWas it proper ramen? No, no, no."
1,Best Chicken Pho in town! No joke! Oh and their steak and rice dish is to absolutely die for. The seasoning is perfection. (Drool!) I need to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee if they have it. Then my heart will be sold forever. Love this place!
0,"I stopped in for a quick lunch time snack of guacamole and chips today. The first bit of bad news is their driveway; huge pot holes right where the entrance meets the sidewalk at University Avenue. I mean, break an axle huge.\n\nThe restaurant interior is oddly laid out, with huge communal tables and very few places for individuals or smaller parties to sit. The music is loud, and everything has that vaguely sticky patina of a beachside popsicle stand, including the riotous color scheme.\n\nThey did prepare my order quickly, and the service was friendly. Too bad the food was utterly disappointing. The tortilla chips had the distinctly off flavor of rancid cooking oil, and the guacamole was thick and gluey in texture and unremarkable in flavor. I got up and left after a few bites."
1,"These guys know what they're doing.  My yellow Trek Marlin 5 acquired a broken spoke somehow while riding which then loosened all the other spokes, but Landis was able to fix everything and get the wheel true again.  I think the knowledgable guy who worked on my rear wheel was named Phil.  It's nice to know that I have a good neighborhood bike shop.  My brother was impressed with the service enough to say, \""You know, that makes me want to buy a bike from them.\""  I'm sure he will."
0,"I was terribly disappointed by experience today.  I placed an order on GrubHub for delivery and it took almost two hours to arrive.  When it did not arrive at the estimated time I contacted GrubHub and they contacted the restaurant who advised it would be here in ten more minutes.  When the driver arrived he said \""sorry for the delay but I am the only driver today\"".  The food was all cold and soggy.  It is bad enough that it took so long to arrive but worse to know that my food had been riding around for so long while he made other deliveries."
0,"Last night I went to the Benihana in Chandler for my birthday. It was the worst experience I have ever had a Benihana and I felt as if I had to write in. It wasn't my first visit, I have been there many many many times. I have a group of friends and we all go when its our birthday. We fill up a table each time. Last year my sister had a baby and as such we've had to adjust the time we normally go. I made a reservation for 5:15pm so she could come and it wouldn't interrupt my 1 year old nephews routine (and he would be in good spirits because as much as I love him I know that kids are emotional sometimes). All 6 people in our party left work early so we would all be on time. My sister and brother in law were waiting in the bar when I got to the restaurant. They had been there since 5 and the bar was empty expect for two tables.  They hadn't even been greeted by the bar tender for the 10 minutes they had been there before me. I checked in with the hostess at 5:15pm and she said it would be a few minutes so I went to the bar to order drinks. After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender, I finally caught her attention and she snapped at me \""I'm the only one here in the bar, I'll help you when I can!\"".  Finally able to get a drink, we were starting to wonder how much longer for the table. At 5:35,  with the incredibly rude hostess, in an almost completely EMPTY restaurant, we finally walked back up and asked how much longer we would be waiting. The two girls had been mainly ignoring the guests and talking to each other and the lone male host. They weren't smiling, or friendly, or nice in any way shape or form. We were told ,rudely, that it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes after that, with my nephew getting antsy, I walked up and said that we need a table (in the now still half empty restaurant and full lobby). She said they would be sitting us 'right now'. I verified that it was in fact 'right now, right now, not right now in another 15 minutes.' And she said yes. My two sisters had walked outside to keep my nephew busy and I brought her back inside, and I pulled our other 3 people from the bar (who had been buying drinks and appetizers). We stood waiting in the lobby another 10 minutes. A full 50 minutes after we had checked in on time we were finally shown to our table. Where our waitress asked if this was our first visit. We told her that we were old pros but she still felt it necessary to go over the ENTIRE menu with us and ignored us trying to tell her that we even knew what we wanted to order. We wanted to get our order in so my sister could actually eat dinner before she had to leave since it had taken us SO long to be seated. The restaurant wasn't full at all and yet the waitresses service was still so slow and she ignored us so often that we ended up stacking our own used dishes up off to the side. She didn't even refill our drinks. My sister had to leave without even eating her meal. Her husband stayed behind to bring it home for her. We finally had to flag our waitress down for our checks and she forgot to use my coupon so we had to flag her down again. We gave her our cards and she forgot to run one of them so we had to flag her down again to run it.  \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for service (especially during the holiday season) but it was the attitude of the hostesses and the lack of involvement from the manager that really upsets me. The manager (who kept walking by the hostess desk) didn't bother to talk to the girls who weren't seating people in a restaurant that was empty! The reason we made such early reservations was so that my sister and my nephew could have dinner with us. I know that my group and I have decided to not go to Benihana's anymore after last night. Had it been only one person with a bad attitude, we would have absolutely been forgiving but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be going back.\n\n**Update in response to the company contacting me, I had actually emailed their customer service first. But didn't hear anything back. It appears that Yelp is monitored more often than the customer service email?"
1,"I've been coming to Discount Tire since I moved to Las Vegas almost 10 years ago now. I have never not been greeted with a smile or ever felt like any of the employees wouldn't go out of their way for me. Like always, life happens and it's never fun to deal with car troubles. Through every single popped tired or deflated tire and even the occasional nail, I've been helped without ever feeling stressed.\n\nMy family and I always come to Discount Tire and receive quality care. We have had to replace tires when tread became low and they honestly told us the situation. We have always gotten great deals on the tires and were never shortchanged for any reason. The beauty is I've never been there all day long for something simple.\n\nBuying your tires through them allows you to come and get a Tire Rotation for free every single time. When it's busy, they tell you the time you'd expect to wait and can even take your number for when everything is done. All in all, this location is the one my family comes to for all our tire needs. When we needed to get a realignment, they referred us to a local shop that could do it at a discounted price. We've been treated like family since we've been coming here and I'd recommend this place above all."
1,"Now, I'm not a violent person, but let's just say I would step on my beloved boyfriend's neck to get to their desserts. Lemon bars? Oh yeah...pie????? Oh heeeeeeells yeah!! Fresh, perfectly sweet and simply delightful.\n\nBesides the yummy tasty treats, we also enjoyed a couple of their breakfast items. Their French toast with a berry compote is two little slices of heaven. Do not get me started on their bacon...bacon dot YEAH!!!! \n\nI can't wait to go here again to sample many more of their dishes. We'll probably go so often it will be like Cheers up in that piece...NORM!!!"
0,"I was disappointed.  Even for an airport restaurant.  I felt like I was forever waiting for something here first and foremost.  My bartender, who wasn't rude, but wasn't Mr. Personality either, seemed at times to be overworked.  But now that I think about it, did he really need to go get that beer keg in the middle of making my spiked milkshake?  Probably not, but I don't know.    This happened time and time again during my time here.  My black bean burger was tasty, and I loved the consistency, BUT it completely fell apart as soon as I bit into it.  Therefore, I was the freak eating my burger with a fork and knife.  It just didn't taste the same...probably because everyone was staring at me.  The regular French Fries left something to be desired.  Also, I had read in another review that this was fairly inexpensive, that was not the case here.  My spiked shake was $13.00, here I was thinking that it was seven, but no, that was the regular shake with no alcohol.  It was delicious, but not $13.00 delicious.  I am going to stop typing now, because as I write this I am starting to get angry and will change my star rating to one."
0,"Well, it's been better than it is now. \n\nI've taken shoes there for at least the last 20 years, but I'm ready to go elsewhere.\n\nI have a short left leg, so I need all of my left heels built up 3/4 inch. The last two pair didn't come out right. One squeaks and pops with each step, and the other one separated from the sole and had to be repaired. (He did fix the former once, but the squeaks returned. He just fixed the latter, nicely. Both fixes were free of additional charge.)\n\nPrices have shot up recently, quite a bit, and the guy no longer takes checks. Bring cash only.\n\nI'll probably look around for another shop for my next heel build-up."
0,"Been here twice now.  First time got a noodle bowl which was very good and a nice value (probably what they do best honestly)  The crab rangoon was a great appetizer and way better than any buffet version I've had.  \n\nThe second visit however, I wanted to try something different so I got the orange beef... which was disgusting.  The beef was overcooked and not tender.  The sauce was overly syrupy and way too sweet with NO taste of orange apart from the hard little candied orange peel curlies swimming in the sauce at the bottom of the plate.  There were four cold broccoli florets included but they had not been tossed with the stir fry....thus were cold and tasteless.  I'm no chef and I'm not from China but I can tell you they missed the boat on this one (no pun intended).\n\nI plan on continuing to go here, I will try the sushi next time."
0,"I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons....\n\n 1. it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage (beer) and about as long for glasses of water. (the restaurant was NOT even 25% full!)\n2. the waiter \""strolled\"" by with his Faux Hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later.\n3. when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger.\n4. we displayed mysterious item mentioned in #3 to said Faux Hawk and he appropriately took the plate away. however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked.\nbottom line, the grilled salad i had was good, but not good enough to warrant a second trip to Cook N Jacks or a recommendation to anyone."
1,"My favorite place to go for fish tacos.  They are delicious.  I haven't liked the other items I've tried as much, but the fish tacos keep me coming back on a regular basis."
0,"Had decent food, but shitty service. Never returning."
0,"This is just a review based on their service and how we were treated there. Our party of 3 arrived at the same time as this huge table apparently. We had our orders ready within minutes and waved to the waiter. He kept acknowledging us but took forever to come. They served us water, which was real prompt and encouraging that it'd be a good meal experience. Finally, the waiter comes and asks us for our order, we give him 3 items. He comes back within a few seconds and tells us their kitchen will be really busy right now and our food will take approximately 30 minutes to come. They had put in the large table order in the kitchen before ours. We got up and left, because we were already behind schedule to leave. But seriously, what kind of business does that?!?! It was 12pm, they should expect the kitchen to be busy!! It's peak lunch hour for goodness sakes! At least they were honest and told us it would take forever for the food to come out. Other places I've been to make it work, but in my opinion, this place indirectly told us to leave or wait an hour for our food. That's how my mind translated what the waiter told us."
1,"Today I came in to see Audrey, to put in some extensions I already had. Even though to our surprise it looked as if I might not have had enough extensions, she worked with what I had and made everything flow perfectly! No gaps and it looks so natural the way she took the time to blend it. She's so good at what she does & is the sweetest girl! I will be back for sure! Very pleased"
0,"Modern Grove has all the makings of a great restaurant. It really reminded me of one of Sam Fox's restaurants, like True Food or something. So adorable inside and out. But that just did not make up for the poor quality food. The bruschetta was pretty good, we got the tomato, pesto and salami, and roasted peppers and goat cheese. I liked the latter 2, but the tomato was...meh. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Like other readers, I found the chicken to taste weird. I asked the server where it was cooked (suspected it was a fully cooked frozen patty when they purchased it), and after avoiding me for about 10 mins, I asked again, and she said her cook was on break and she'd have the answer soon. Answer was that they overnight the chicken, and she overemphasized that they keep it in the refrigerator until they use it, or they freeze it before it goes bad. Well whoop de do! Good for you, MG! You refrigerate your meat!! Anyway, things were just not good, and it seems like they cut corners in a lot of places by buying pre-made food items and not really cooking anything from scratch. My husband got the BBQ cheddar burger and the bun was huge but the burger patty was itty bitty. Just because you have a huge bun doesn't fool me on the actual burger size!  Although the fries were tasty :). So overall very disappointed. Don't let Modern Grove fool you into thinking they are fresh or healthy."
1,"I was a little apprehensive renting from Fox in Vegas after I read the reviews, but the rental was very good, although I'm waiting for my deposit credit. The staff was pleasant and helpful in keeping the price down..even gave me a credit for using a cab to get to the rental lot instead of the shuttle bus. Car was nice, no problems with drive to LA and back to Vegas. Facility and service was good or better than most and the price was excellent. A gas station was close to the rental lot. Would use again. But make sure you inspect the car thoroughly for dents and scratches before driving off and keep the small inspection paper!"
0,"This place has potential but  tonight  it didn't .\n\nThe AC WAS NOT ON. it was a very humid evening,.\n\nMy blackberry margarita tasted watered down and very very weak. Even the color was weak\nThe same person was hostess bartender and server. Lol\n\nThe chipotle and salsa rosa were very good although needed  salt.\n\nChips were greasy and waxy tasting, yuk. They were shiny with grease.\n\nFish tacos had promise but were bland as could be and oil was dripping all over corn tortillas. They were drenched with oil\n\nRefried beans were very good. \n\nSoups were awful, tasteless.\nIt was a slow night.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice though"
0,Costco is usually very good with their customer service but in the past year I have been very disappointed. The location itself is good but the customer services reps at the counter have not been friendly the past few times we have needed to return an item and this past trip they upset us a great deal. I have no issue with their policy's but rather with the employee not knowing the correct information and assuring us the issue will be resolved and then on our next encounter denying that those words were ever said. We will be looking for a better location from now on with friendly and helpful employees!
1,"Before heading back to the strip from an all night gambling streak here at The M, we stopped to grab a snack at  Vig Deli.  I wanted something small and simple, so I opted for a 1/4pd hot dog.  Have I forgotten how big a 1/4 pd really is? If I was supposed to order by the numbers, well I already screwed up by saying \""1 hot dog, please.\""  At any rate, it was tasty and at least know that the hot dog is safe there.  My friend had a basket of fries and I even split the hot dog with her.  I think chili would have been perfect with those fries and the hot dog as well.  I think we tend to get delirious about snacking when you've been gambling all night and hit a deli at 3am.\nWhere have the soda machines gone?"
0,"Bland food. Serving wasn't well eg rice was cold, gyro wasn't well done, etc. kale wasnt well cut... not recommended."
1,"My typical drinks:\n-Black currant iced tea\n-Black Guatemalan coffee\n-The Grouchy John blended drink\n\nGrouchy John's is what a coffee shop should be. The coffee & tea is fantastic, amenities are very inviting, and the staff is very friendly. GJ & JJ are community oriented, passionate about the bean, and just overall great guys...why wouldn't you support them?"
0,"The food is terrible, the drinks are good and cheap yet I'm a chef and it's sad to see the shit they put out here"
0,"Save your time and money and go to Dry Bar at the Scottsdale Quarter across from Kierland or Kimberly's dry bar on Lincoln Drive in Phoenix.  You will be glad you did.  This place has poor customer service and the receptionists are snotty and unprofessional.\n\nThe facialist, Linda, is extremely unprofessional, rude and condescending.  She does not give a good facial.\n\nEnough said."
0,"Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad. \n\nWe (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible. \n\nI know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant."
1,Me and my friends call this our last stop before leaving Vegas. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef is my absolute favorites. Best hangover food other than stake and eggs.
1,"I've been to numerous clubs in Vegas but so far, this is the best club I have been to.  The wait is ridiculous, but if you have $$$ get bottle service, or if you have homies in Vegas with hook ups, call them!  It is definitely worth the hassle.  You want to look good, dress sexy, and bring lots of cash and credit to buy drinks.  Drinks cost lots...but everywhere in vegas its muy expensive!  This place has one of the largest patios near their pool to chill, smoke, meet people, and chat throughout the long hours of the night til dawn.  The dance floor is pretty big too, not too crowded.  It opens up into the patio area, so the place is well ventilated.   You can even dip your feet in the pool if it starts sweating in your sandals to rid of any vinegar smell you may have developed haha.  Vegas always has a good diverse crowd with a DJ who places music to fit everyone's taste.  I think the fact that this place is huge, and the patio is huge, and the fact that everyone wants to go somewhere new, this place is definitely the spot!  \n\nPlanning a bachelorette or bachelor party? do it here.  My girl and I met so many people about to get married and had their bottle service there.  Its super expensive so be ready to let go of some ends!  It was even fun with just me and my girlfriend, dancing the night away, walking around and chit chatting w/ everyone.  The main thing is, you CAN walk around, you CAN see people, AND even better, no long lines to go pee!  It's not super crowded or dark like Tao. LOL. \n\nSo if you're planning to go to Sin City, XS should be on your itinerary for sure!"
1,"I love this place, it is very small and is a little pricey but they have some of the best sushi.  If you have ever been to Fresh Wasabi you know the sushi is great.  We always get the climax roll & viva Las Vegas rolls which are my favorite.  I usually have my wife order all the rest since I am good with just that roll.  It is a little casual place for lunch and I think they have some specials but I never order them.  Don't come with a big group but its not a bad quick date place since the food is so great."
0,"*sigh* Now let me start by saying I'm a native Las Vegan so I am basically a buffet expert. This buffet is sorry. The only reason my mom and I came here was because we received a 2 for 1 voucher for lunch. Literally the only two things I remember about this buffet are the crab legs and the clam chowder. If I come here again it's gonna be strictly for the crab. For the Aria to be so beautiful and one of the newer properties on the strip, I was very disappointed. Their prices need to come down about $10 before I go there again. It just wasn't worth it. I see why they were giving out 2 for 1 comps.\n\nI did appreciate that the crab legs were already opened and that you could get them steamed or cold. That was really nice."
0,I've been here a few times and as much as the service is always awesome. I can't forgive them for what happened. \n\nIt was a beautiful day so the boyfriend and I decided to take the motorcycles out. We decided to stop by Home Plate. The previous times I've had the breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast any time of the day. But we felt like pasta and decided on the spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. Boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. It was overly seasoned so we sent it back. The spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. But at that point I was hungry and just finished what I could. Plus we had plans for the ride and we didn't want to waste the day. \n\nLater that afternoon while riding near Boulder Highway I all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. I thought it was just me so I didn't think anything of it. But when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit. \n\nOur nice afternoon out on the bikes was cut short as we both raced back home. We will never be back.
1,"This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.\n\nI have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant."
0,"Nasty, nasty, nasty.  The puppies look like they come from puppy mills.  This place is a puppy mill.  They are dirty and matted.  This place is disgusting and no way they actually care about the pups.  They would do so much better if they would give the pups a bath occasionally.  Go to Puppy Boutique on Craig and Rancho (NW Las Vegas) if you would like a quality pup.  This is where I ended up buying my Havanese.  Puppy Boutique is clean and professional.  You know they care about the pets by looking at their condition."
0,"i have a SUPER hard time giving this place less than 3 stars. I am convinced it was an off day. I went a few weeks back and went back and forth on whether or not i should write a review. \n\n I normally wouldn't review it until after i gave it a second chance but i honestly don't see myself ever giving it a second chance. so because of that i will rate based on my belief that this place actually is better than my experience.\n\ni want to start with the positive. i like the casual space and i love the chef standing by the oven. he is so cute. looks like he's straight off of a nintendo game. mario-esque. he looks like he's totally just jolly and humming while he works. i love him. i also like the prices.\n\nnow to the nitty gritty. \nwe were in a rush and i had heard they do pizza by the slice. sounds fast to me.\n\nwell, it wasn't.  we take a seat at the bar and the bartender is basically on the other side shouting at us? i wasn't even sure he was talking to us. did he want us to shout across and over all of the other people at the bar? this wasn't a loud place, it was actually super quiet in there so the shouting was very awkward and obnoxious. i like to be greeted somewhat close to my face, not shouted at. made me really uncomfortable. \n\nthen he was chit chatting on his phone, it was obviously a personal call. we just sat waiting and waiting to order our slices. finally he makes it close to us to take our order and the jolly pizza oven man gets to work :) I'm not sure what took so long after that but it took forever to get our slices. we were there for 30 minutes when i had expected it to take about 5-10. \n\nmy friend got the plain cheese slice and i got the prosciutto arugala slice. both were pretty nasty. mine smelled like feet and fish. that went in the trash. we split her cheese slice to hold us over until we had time to pick up something else."
0,"Since you are at the airport, of course you expect it to be expensive.  I got the chicken parm which was not bad.  My stomach did not feel all that great during the flight so maybe it wasn't that good.  I think i will just stick to McD's when at the airport."
0,"Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.  \n\nLocated in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.\n\nLet's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.\n\nDo not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.\n\nThe other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.\n\nAfter eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good."
0,"Had the three taco lunch special.\n\nService was friendly and prompt.\n\nOffered chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the dish, albeit very mild, is good.  Tried an assortment of other salsas from the salsa bar.  The \""taco sauce\"" was somewhat bland, the salsa verde was very good (and spicy) but the other salsas I tried were lacking punch.\n\nOrdered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.\n\nAll three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.\n\nCarne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.\n\nChicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.\n\nCarnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.\n\nThere's not a huge beer selection, which is a positive, but had he standards and a good selection of mexican beers.\n\nHopefully they can get the spice levels set correctly and I would be more than happy to give it another shot."

0,"Don't remember all very well but I know it's more of a young relaxed crowd that frequent this club. Whisky River comes with a country vibe to it. I first came in here back in '08 or '09 with some friends in which I got us a table and had a fun time dancing and watching drunk chicks get on some mechanical bull they have in there yeah fun time.\n\nNow, move forward to 2011. After hanging out at Kazba which turned out to be a let down, I tried to get into this club with friends from NC.\nGot to the door and my friends were fine to go in but not me. The guy at the entrance didn't believe my Nevada ID was real. Informed him I was visiting from LV. He asked me what's the address on it and before I could tell him, he said no, you're not getting in with this... haha dude cracked me up!\n\nThe trip to charlotte ended up being weird. I was in the twilight zone, what a bummer."
1,"Best dental experience of my life! I hate going to the dentist, despise it even. From the noise to the taste, it's all a nightmare for me, but Shelly my hygienist and Dr. Kuo the actual dentist made my visit amazingly positive. The best part was that they even took my insurance without having to pay anything up front (unlike at other places that make you pay first, then get reimbursed later). Because of this latter fact, I have told all my coworkers about it! \n\nTrue, they do offer a lot of services that aren't covered, but they are just doing their job, you don't have to accept any of them, but to treat myself I got the fluoride treatment for only $25! I even learned a lot more about my mouth than my other dentist so I am now a super fan of flossing, brushing right, and eating things that are healthy for my teeth. I can't say that any other office made me feel as enthusiastic about caring for my teeth as this place. Plus they have the spit sucker instead of the little bowl on the side of your chair which means you can barely taste any of the junk they put in your mouth.\n\nDefinitely recommend!"
0,"My son walked into this barber shop, no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him. They looked at him after already being in there for five minutes and told him to sign in. Not welcoming, terrible customer service."

1,Great Turkey Grinder!
1,"This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!"
0,"The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \""firecracker\"" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill."
0,"My first experience was so awesome I couldn't wait to come back.  I thought best service, wine , food and atmosphere.  This time a total 180. Note to our waiter\n\""listening skills\""  \nLast time we split every dish was separated and equally plated. This time he hacked into the steak at the table. Presentation ruined! Steak knifes came after the steak, when does that happen in a steak house? When he came to check on us, it wasn't until I had to reach out to the manager. By that time all our food was cold. When the waiter came to apologize, he said if the chef had to slice it in the kitchen, it would be an extra charge. I challenge him to find that button on the POS  system. If that was not bad enough, when the check came the waiter was swarming around my table like a shark on the hunt. Clearly this experience was not about our celebration, but our waiter."
0,Ordered Chicken Biriyani and found a bone piece (with no meat). wonder if its from a left over plate.. yuck...anyways taste was also bad.
1,"Excellent ramen & takoyaki. At decent prices as well. Would come back everyday if I can, especially for the takoyaki. I mean it's $4.80! It's a steal! \nCustomer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it. \nAtmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good."
1,"The food is excellent and the best part of the restaurant is that the patio is open now!  Well that may not be the best part, but it is a welcome addition.  The fish tacos are the best I've had and you can't go wrong with the dollar tacos.  If you're feeling adventurous, order a cabeza taco... It's awesome and after all for a dollar, what do you have to lose."
1,"Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)"
1,"I absolutely loved my gyro and garlic feta fries. While I was here, a lady told the owner that she visit her family in New York and in Greece and told her she loved how authentic the gyros were. Me? I wouldn't know if they are authentic or not, I just know the gyro I had was wonderful. Moist meat, right amount of sauce too. Also something unique that I've never had before was the garlic feta fries, these were very good however I must warn you, do not have these fries on a first date or if you need to speak customers at work. Very, very nice people here, they seemed to be friendly to everyone. I didn't try their baklava but the table next to me raved about it so I'll try it next time because I know I'll be back next time I'm near here. Some reviews may say these place is pricey, but I just think those people are cheap, prices were in line with other gyro places. I got the gyro meal for $10.95 which included a side and drink. Totally reasonable. Try this place I think you'll like it."
0,"Britney doesnt sing , dubbed, (which we knew and didnt care) however no big screen to see when far away, which we were also not far away but could not see very well.  Also Briteny DID NOT show any effort or enthusiam about being there and her dancing was WAY less adequate than her actual dancers who were amazing by the way.  However I did not pay to see her dancers.  I was very dissapointed about paying that amount of money for what we actually recieved.  The worst was the fact it was abvious she was not performing, she was going through the actions."
1,"Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!"
0,"I've only ever been here once for a buffet lunch, so the al-a-carte menu might be good, but we were ignored by our server, and found the dishes to be greasy, bland, or overwhelmingly spicy.  I love Indian food, and was really hoping this would be better.  I'll keep going all the way to South Kings for Maharani's infinitely superior butter chicken and fresh naan.  \n\nAlso, Naan bread should never never never never never be served in a buffet dish under a heat lamp.  A proper Indian restaurant should have a tandoor (clay oven), and should be cooking it fresh for every table.  It's the easiest thing in the world if you have the right oven.  Their's was soggy and dry at the same time, which is an awful combination.  I doubt I'll be going back.  (I'm a little psychotic about my Naan, but when it's done right it's amazing.)"
0,"I've been to Rosati's plenty of times before (never this location), any my experience has never been this bad.  I called in a carry out order at 4:30 pm (This is well before the dinner rush).  The girl taking the call doesn't take my name and unceremoniously hangs up on me after saying the pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  I show up at 4:55pm, and say to the girl at the counter \"" I am here to pick up a carry out order\"".  She asks my name and I tell her the girl on the phone didn't ask my name.  She responds, \""oh yeah, I didn't\"".  She checks on my pizza and tells me it going to be another 5 minutes.  Fine, I pay and sit down on the bench out front.  I can over hear what sounds like 5 - 6 teenagers talking loud about energy drinks and their work schedules.  By the way they were cursing I imagine they either forgot I was up front or do not care.  The girl at the counter came back at 5:05 to tell me my pizza is almost out and it shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.  She then leaves to go to Albertsons.  I am not high school math teacher but I know it takes longer than 5 minutes to walk to Albertsons, pick out your energy drinks, pay for them, then walk back to Rosatis.  But all of that happened before my pizza came out.  5:15 pm my pizza is ready.  That's 45 minutes on a slow night.  I've worked in pizza places before and know it doesn't take that long to cook a pizza.  All would have been forgiven had the pizza actually been cooked.   When I got home the family sat down and to eat and were surprised by crunchy (uncooked) onions, and extremely under cooked dough.  I'm wondering why I game them $28 for one of my worst pizza experiences ever.  \n\nLet me restate this, we normally LOVE Rosati's pizza, but this is our first time visiting this location.  It will also be our last.  I'd much rather pay half that price and get a better product from Barro's across the street.  Maybe the Roasti's in Chandler will be better..."
0,I will never go back there again... we had 9 people all of us nicely dressed except for my brother in law that flew in from Hawaii (marine) for his sisters  birthday. he was wearing a polo jeans and work boots.. we were at VB GB for a while and then went to Ohso for a drink.. the birthday girl wanted to dance so we figured to head to Label.. the cover charge was 15 bucks.  and they wouldn't let in my brother in law because he had on boots.. then proceeded to blame it on his attitude after they wouldn't let him in.. I just think it's really wrong to not let in somebody that serving your country.  he's 25 and mature enough to handle a situation and not hurt anybody with his boots..
1,Come here and grab a sangwich before you pre-game and then again after hoeing around in the club! the original and the tuna melt... that's maaaah faaavorite!!! enjoy!
0,"One of the worst sushi places I have tried. I walked in and I was the only person there. I should have walked out after the smell of sewer hit my nose, but I did not want to be rude. The shrimp was flat...FLAT and there was lemon juice drizzled on it, probably to hide the lack of freshness. The staff was very good. The service was not bad. I am not sure why so many local sushi places feel the need to blare hip-hop. Sushi is supposed to be relaxing and social. I cannot see myself returning"
1,"The hot dogs are pre-made and available for a \""hot dog buffet\""\n\nThey also sell cheesesteaks which are actually very good.\n\nNot fancy but good food."
1,"Who knew there was good Indian food in Arizona!!!!!! \n\nIndian Paradise is a wonderful little restaurant that serve great food. Yes, it is not something you'd find in London, LA, or NYC, worth stopping in for a taste! \n\nTheir buffet does not have a lot of spicy food, but it's fresh and good. At $11 it's not a bad deal!  \n\nI'm a new fan and look forward to trying it for dinner. Oh yeah, the Naan is awesome!!"
1,"As far as fast food chicken goes, Raising Canes takes the cake. There chicken is juicy, succulent and finger lickin' good. Paired with their secret Canes sauce, coleslaw, crinkle cut fries, and a slice of garlic bread, you'll never leave hungry!"
1,"We've been coming to this diner for years and have always loved it even when it was the, \""Golden Gate Diner.\"" Dupars is good comfort food and great for those late nights of drinking down of Fremont. The portions are big but the prices have gone up and they don't have any cheap graveyard specials like they used to. If you like pancakes you must try these. The formula is great and they use melted butter!! I'd certainly recommend this place to anyone new to downtown!"
0,"The good: the cupcakes! We got a four-pack of, I believe, red velvet, pink champagne, smores, and the peanut butter chocolate one. They were all good, though I'm not sure what the pink champagne was supposed to taste like - it was a little odd, but you know, it's a cupcake. So I ate it. They're moist, the frosting is good, and that's what matters. \n\nThe not-so good: when we went in there were a few people there, not sure if they were the owners or their employees (they looked to be in their mid twenties or so) and they were all kinda.. rude. They just gave us this dead stare and seemed really impatient with us, even though we came in at a dead as hell time (monday afternoon, pre-lunch, since we were out). It just seemed like they wanted us to get OUT asap. After trying a few more flavors, the orange creamsicle and strawberry cupcakes taste really artificial and have a heavy chemical smell - ick.\n\nOn the chalkboard it said, \""Can't say anything about customer service, but the cupcakes are good!\"" and I feel as though that sums this place up perfectly."
0,"Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \n\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again."
1,"This is not the most up to date Bashas in the Phoenix area and it seems to be neglected by corporate. However, staff and cashiers are always super friendly and they work hard with what they have to make the store presentable. Its so close to my house that I love coming here. Keep up the good work Bashas employees!"
0,"I booked this hotel with the hopes of a relaxing weekend by the four pools.  I booked through Perfect Escapes because of the free room upgrad and early check in.  When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, we were told it would be 30-60 min before our room was ready.  Not a huge deal, so we had the bell desk hold our bags and decided to check out the pool area.  As soon as we walked outside we hear extremely loud jackhammering going on.  They were using jackhammers at what looked like two of the four pools.  It was so loud we could stand side by side and not hear each other and it stirred up so much dust it was hard to see.  We immediately asked inside how long it would be going on.  They then told us it would be going on the entire weekend until 4 p.m. each day.  There was no indication of construction on the resort website or perfect escapes. Disappointing after $45 cab ride to the resort and then another $45 cab ride to another resort after then paying to use the hotel internet to find another resort.  I go to the Phoenix area often and have staid at Camelback Inn, Hyatt Gainey Ranch and Hotel Indigo.  All were wonderful accomodations.  From the look of this hotel on several websites, it was quite beautiful and relaxing and very comparable to the other resorts in the area.  Unfortunately, I never even made it to the room due to the construction.  It was not the relaxing weekend I had planned for.  The construction should have been disclosed on all websites linked to the hotel."
0,"We used to go here all the time.  We like eating dinner outside by the fire pits.  Their food is okay.  The last time we went here it was very busy for a Sunday night.  We waited over an hour for our food.  We came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group.  The orders were done at the same time.  One of the orders had an appetizer that came out 10-15 minutes after their meal.  We knew that we wouldn't get our food at the same time however another order came out over 20 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eating.  That order was for 2 hamburgers and it's funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first.  Even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something.  We understood it was a busy night but we felt like maybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it.  We asked to talk to a manager who's name is \""Megan\"" and she was extremely defensive.  She just kept saying with an attitude \""Sorry, it's a busy night\"",  \""I don't know what to tell you\"", \""what do you want me to do about it?\"".  It didn't seem like she cared about customer service.  She was basically blowing us off and not sincere about her \""Sorry\"". It was excuse after excuse... she would say \""well the numbers don't go in order\"" then she said \""it's because you ordered well done burgers\"" (btw, we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked)...    We told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we might not come back and she said \""i think that's best\"".  If this is the type of person that is representing this business, then it's bad for business.  If you make a mistake own up to it or sincerely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back.  We asked to talk to a general manager or the owner at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesn't deal with stuff like this.  Which may be true but if she truly felt like she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no problem giving us the owner's name.  The manager Megan was rude, argumentative, impatient, and indignant.  After some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen manager's request and then asked us to leave the business.  Which we were glad to do after that experience.  Anyway to sum it up, the atmosphere is nice, the food is okay, the wait for food is very long on busy nights, and the Manager MEGHAN is awful!!!"
1,"This place is the best.  \n\nFirst of all, nobody beats that $20 bruschetta and wine deal on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The bruschetta is delicious, there's a ton of it, and the wine doesn't come from a \""bargain menu\"".  This deal makes the day-specific special offers of other restaurants look stingy and pitiful. \n\nEverything I've had there is delicious and the service is always great.  My only complaints are the casualties of visiting an awesome place: the wait for seating, and for the bathroom.  I'm not used to waiting 45 minutes to get in to a place, but I'll do it for Postino."
1,L'endroit id\u00e9al pour un rendez-vous d'affaire ou pour \u00e9tudier... le tout autour d'un bon caf\u00e9!
1,"The waiter was amazing, and so was the food. The ambiance is really nice. Very fun and loud. VERY casual. Don't wear anything nice, you WILL smell like their sauces. The food was really great and super interactive. I don't suggest the shrimp, they're not that great. King crab still has my mouth drooling."
1,"Quality 24/7 food in vegas. Pit stop, fill up, drink up, back at the strip!\n\nIf you want good portion sizes, a meal thatll keep you full, and want to pass up on mickey Ds and Dennys, hit this place up."
1,"HOLY MEAT-GASM!\n\nI have been stationed in front of Chima restaurant (as the resident uptown Hot Dog Dude) since it was being built.  As it is a bit on the hefty side, price wise, I haven't had the opportunity to eat there til now. BIG MISTAKE!\n\nOn the pro side:\n\nAwesome atmosphere, super attentive staff, wonderfully appointed surroundings, complimentary valet parking, insanely good food.  \n\nCons: Beer was a bit expensive (but they had to make up the cost of all the food I ate SOMEWHERE!)\n\nMy wife , myself and another couple took advantage of restaurant week and went to this Festival of Meat for the first time.  I am almost without words in consideration to the service, food quality and overall experience.  Though everything was not perfect (food-wise) MOST was. \n\nIt's a splurge restaurant for us normal folks but it is worth the babysitting money and the time we waited for a table for sure. \n\nGet there, get some and get a nap!\n\nVic OUT!"
1,"This is one of my favorite spots in all of Phoenix. But, I have a BIG problem.  The \""Andy's Favorite TLT\"" sandwich is so damn good, I can't get to trying more things on the menu. \n\nGreat food, great atmosphere.  Best in class!"
1,"What a nice place!  Looks to be great for a date.  Nice decor, dark with nice background music...soccer on the TV in the bar.  White tablecloths.  Enjoyable food and staff.  \n\nWent for lunch and had the Blackened Salmon salad.  Salmon was cooked perfectly very nice firm texture and tasty favor with nice blacken/pepper over fresh lettuces, tomato, onion, egg slices and a nice dressing.\n\nThey waiters were in suits or vests with tie.  The have a person serving bread and assisting with drinks, etc. The bread was delicious, baked on the premises and was told they have a baker how does the deserts too.\n  \nMenu looks very interesting.  Will have to go back for a nice dinner.  \n\nForgot to check out the hours but just check the website."
1,Salad bar is awesome with everything you could possibly want.  The top sirloin was my favorite but everything was wonderful.  The chocolate moose cake was to die for!!!  Good service and atmosphere... Maybe just a tad on the pricy side.
1,"I'm a fan of this resort. Friendly people, good value, nice pool and having free water and internet (even though it is wired) is really nice since I was using this trip for dual purpose. My son and his friend went to 3 different golf courses (all great central location) and I worked from the hotel during the day. It was comfortable - was able to use the little patio out front of the room or the desk as a mini office. \n\nI wish they were able to keep the use of the personal hot tubs in the suite I stayed. I guess they've come under some regulation for this so they've closed all of them - it would have been awesome to have use of that in my back patio! \n\nThe room needs a little renovation, but it is clean and spacious. What mattered to me for this trip."
1,"Had me at hello.\n\nTo think I may never have ever came here, given that its past incarnation, The Crags, had been one of my favourite bars around the town a few years back. It was only through a chance conversation with a Sheep's Heid waitress that alerted me to Salisbury's existence.\n\nThe sister restaurant to the Sheep's Heid Inn, I would argue that the Salisbury Arms is more like the tougher big brother! The menu is the same as Sheep's Heid however as Salisbury houses a larger kitchen, it has the advantage of including the Heid's more popular specials as part of their regular menu, also allowing them three times the daily specials the Heid can manage. Three times as many!\n\nThe building intself is a sturdy old townhouse built of bricks, muscle and brawn. The inside has been decked out in the manner (or manor...?) of an old American winter cabin, complete with antlers on the walls and blazing fire classily located in the centre of the room. Very swish.\n\nMy last visit saw me dine on Roast Duck with Potato Dauphinoise, Butternut Squash, Curly Kale and Rosemary Sauce (see photos). Putting the unbeatable Mark Greenaway duck to one side, this is Edinburgh's duck silver-medallist. Abolutely melt in the mouth, generous portions, amazing combination of flavours. It was love. Can't stop talking about it.\n\nJennie opted for the gammon, a meat I would rarely select from a menu, and even that rocked the boat, steering clear of the usual thin round of meat, instead presented thick-cut and juicy, with chips that required a knife and fork themselves! Immense.\n\nThe old bar area is still intact with the addition of board games and live music on the weekends, all combining to make this an excellent location for a chilled out evening, or even a pre-going out meal.\n\nIf the food was rubbish I would moan about the prices, but my duck was worth every penny of the \u00a315 asking price. And from the other dishes I've been lucky enough to try, they've all been worth the cash. The staff in turn are warm, friendly and sociable on all the right levels.\n\nAbsolute winner. Joey's Top 5 without question."
0,"Despite the name, you can't use coins here. Everything is operated with a special cash card you must buy on site and you can only pay for with bills. No coins, no debit or credit cards, just bills. \n\nIf I had actually been able to use any of the machines I might have been able to leave a better review. The place is very clean and attended with machines that appear to be very well maintained."
1,"This is a fun place to gamble on the cheapo slots.  They have a lot of fun & interesting games that I had only seen at this property.  Don't expect a lot of waitress service, but if you want to bang away on some slots and be able to move to a lot of different machines in a couple hours, you can do it here right in the middle of the strip."
1,"I can't give La Belle Terre he full five stars yet, but I hope to go back and get some of their wonderful looking pastries!  Wow!  What a sight!!\n\nI stopped in to check the place out and to get a few dinner rolls.  I got a half dozen mini ciabatta rolls.  We had two of the rolls with dinner this tonight and they're quite good and just what I wanted!  I think I put on an extra pound just ogling the pastries in the case!  I think they were about to call Metro and report me.\n\nService was very quick and very friendly.  Again, I thank my fellow Yelperazzi for letting me in on this secret.  I didn't know what was behind the big sign I saw going west on Sahara.  Now I'll be parked under that sign numerous times to come.  \n\nThe place also helps with your mental ability--in fact it has made me a bit clairvoyant.  I foresee me doing lunch here very soon!  C'est si bon!"
0,"Over priced on just about everything in stock. Seriously why would I pay almost $6 for a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Also the staff can be very rude at times and seem like they do not want to deal with certain people who shop there, kind of made me feel like I was not wanted. \n\n\nI am always looking for a good bargin but this place has some of the weirdest policies when it comes to their sales. I can not stand when they over price their meat so that they can make it look like you are getting a good deal when they advertise a \""sale\"". \n\nSeriously since when does a pack of pork chops cost almost $15? Or 2 thin little steaks almost $18? All they do is take a pack of meat, mark it up 2 or 3 times the price and say it is buy one get one free. They move more product and still make a good amount of money. They are not the only ones doing this but they are doing it almost every week!! No wonder this place is always so empty!\n\nWhile they do have a larger selection of some items it is not enough to get me to shop here regularly."
0,"We love eating at Chipolte, but this location was the worst experience I have ever had at one of their restaurants. \nThey were out of chips (no chips at a Mexican restaurant?!)\nThey were out of lettuce.\nBlack beans were crunchy (must have just come out of the can).\nBathrooms were gross.\nTables had not been wiped down and cleaned.\nThis was on a Saturday night at 8 pm, so it was inexcusable to not have the basic food items available."
0,"The minicupcakes are cute and taste sweet but the vanilla has a strange aftertaste from the frosting. The black and white is good though. Meanwhile their ice creams (cap'n ' crunch, salted caramel, cherry vanilla) are all atrocious. I've literally never tasted ice cream this bad. The salted caramel just tastes like salt, the cap n' crunch is crappy soggy peanut butter mush and the cherry vanilla just tastes like a bad imitation of Ben and Jerry's. The worst by far is not using the berry cap n crunch. Holstein's and Momofuku is much better."
0,"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times.  Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen.  If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct (as in get what you ordered as you ordered it) and hot.  If they are busy, forget it.  They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen."
1,"This is a great restaurant.  Went for the first time for restaurant week for a reasonably priced prix fixe.  And when we went in the second time, there was another prix fixe.  Maybe that's all they do.  Either way, it's gonna cost you a little bit, but the food is so delicious.  They do the typical small upscale style entrees, which is good cause you don't leave feeling like you just ate a cow, but you are still satisfied.\nFor a restaurant in a hotel, it's very reasonable and very good.  The inside is very classy, with a modern look to it, but at the same time, since it's in the hotel, I don't believe they really enforce any dress codes.\nThey provide you with bread.  I got the lamb chops and chicken the two times I went.  I believe it may have been Ashley farms, but I'm not certain.  Both were excellent.  I wanted to suck the juices out of the bones haha."
1,"In my view, the great thing about the Cask and Barrel is that it serves unique and high quality drinks at reasonable prices and without the ostentatious atmosphere.  Inside it feels like a traditional pub with a fancy, well-polished wooden bar, comfortable seating and really polite, friendly staff.  However, it also succeeds in attaining a contemporary feel with at least five plasma screens showing the latest sporting events. \nI was in when they were showing a World Cup qualifying match and the place had a great fun and friendly atmosphere.  Further, the pints tasted abnormally fresh and they had a great selection of spirits and speciality cider and beers on offer.  \nI really enjoyed my experience of Cask and Barrel and I encourage anyone to visit just for the homely atmosphere."
1,"Me and my friends chill here twice a week. Nader is the best bartender around. Great music, lots of tv's, and great food. I LOVE this place"
0,"I have eaten here many times.. Always wanting to give it one more chance.. never again. The items are dried out, just lack taste.. Today the Nevada health department said they were 3 demerits away from being closed, this was due to food being spoiled, dirty kitchen, employees NOT washing their hands properly.. and more.. I was so hoping this place would be better each time I visited.. but each time it just gets worse.. Not sure what is happening.. When they first opened they were amazing.. when the health department stops by unexpected and you are 3 demerits away from failing.. 48 out of 50... sad,,"
0,My wife and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in Mesa just for the night.  I ordered the fish tacos and a Birria taco.  My wife ordered the green chili pork burrito.  None of them tasted that good...compared to many similar taco joints I've been to in the past.  The fish tacos for instance simply had way too much stuff on top which made it difficult to eat.  Sorry this was a miss for us however I do give them at least 2 stars for packaging everything so nicely on our to-go order.
0,"This theater isn't nearly as scary as people make it out to be - it's just a relic from the early 90s when Mills malls were the rage all over the country.  Now they just look dated and have a different crowd.\n\nI was dragged here on a Thursday night to lose a few brain cells watching a mind-numbing comedy with five other people in the entire ghost town of a theater. I'll never be able to get those hours back, but even if they offered refunds for that at the box office I am sure Harkins would direct us to the self-service machine only to have it break down on us.\n\nMelinda's card wouldn't swipe when we were trying to buy tickets on one machine - so we moved to the other machine where the transaction was successful, but the tickets and receipt didn't print.  We then had to go to the box office, which is exactly what those machines were meant to prevent, to tell them our tickets didn't print.  The manager simply just let us in.  I suppose we could have made up that story entirely.  Maybe we will next time."
1,"I love that Hulas made a second location because every time we head to Scottsdale/old town and we can't make our mind up on where to eat, we head to Hulas...\n\nI love their Mai-Tai's... \n\nAs some of you may know I am a huge fan of their \""Hangover Hash\""... Not because I'm hungover quite often but I love the ingredients... That luau pork over the crispy hash browns goes great with the 2 over medium eggs on top... That is my go to breakfast/brunch option...\n\nI have so many other favorites on the menu but I'm making myself hungry as I write this review so this one will be a short one...\n\nThe decor here is very cute and goes well in the Old Town area... Service is prompt and some days get busier than others... Great job Hula's #2..."
1,"Fresh, \""real\"" food made by some of the nicest people in Las Vegas. Don't be put off by the location in a mall. The food is one thousand times better than what you'd find in a fancier place. The difference is in the freshness of the ingredients and the homemade quality. Try the roasted chicken with paprika and carmelized onions or the chicken skewers with rice. Also great is the Greek salad, gyro platter, and of course baklava for dessert! Support small, independent businesses like this one rather than corporate chains that care more about profits than quality. You will not be disappointed!"
0,"Their pizza isn't always fantastic if you order a lunch special but thats to be expected since it is a lunch special and it's not cooked right when you order it. \nMy last visit there was pretty bad, as I was halfway through eating my meal, I noticed a couple of cockroaches under a table a few seats down from me.  1 cock roach was dead, the other one was hanging out with his dead buddy.  Needless to say, I may have overreacted a bit, but my food just began to taste awful (Yes I know thats just in my head) and I had to throw my food away and leave.  \n\nI'm sure they'll improve next time but I don't feel as though I'll be returning for a little while."
0,This sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service. The window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as I got to the window. I'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find.
0,"If you wanna have honestly the WORST wannabe Mexican food in sin city , well go to Diablos !!! Taco Bell food is gourmet compared to this crap ...  I went during happy hour & there's no happy hour food just horrible tasting non discounted margaritas . I ordered a pitcher of mango margaritas & from where I was sitting I saw it being prepared from canned kerns nectar & house tequila instead of the premium tequila from the menu . The nachos were sooo soggy I thought I was eating 2 hour left over nachos from a gas station and the taco platter I orders were beyond tasteless .... I would so not recommend this to anyone unless u don't care but to get drunk on cheap liquor , bad food & HORRIBLE customer service"
0,"We had the 2-for-1 coupon, but we still didn't think this was worth it at all.  It's EXTREMELY high up, you can't hear the music that goes with the Belagio fountains, and they let way too many people up there at the same time.  There were people lined up to leave who were freaking out a little.  There were people fighting for the space to take pictures.  I'd recommend you save your money and look at a postcard."
0,"Ignore the glitz and glamor...this place is a waste of time.  The wait to get in is forever long.  We stood in line at 8 and didn't get to the door until 945.  Once you get in, there are 3 levels of disappointment to choose from and to get to each one, you have to walk up and down several flights of stairs.    \n\nThe bottom floor...I didn't stay on this floor long, because people were just standing around.  I didn't come to a club to stand around and people watch, so on to the next one.\n\nThe main floor was popping.  If you can't dance and want to get lucky this is the place to be.  I could barely walk to the dance floor without people brushing their sweat up against me.  When I finally got to the floor, the bouncers were telling people to move and walk the other way bc the floor was too packed.  \""That's fine,\"" I thought...\""There's always the 3rd room. \""\n\nThe top floor had chairs and tables everywhere.  The room was smaller than my hotel room.  What's the point of having an area where you can barely move and to get out, you have to walk around in a circle?! \n\nAt this point I was done with Marquee.  I just wanted to get out, but it's not going to be that easy.  I felt like I had to go through a maze of 6-7 flights of stairs, to get out of this house of horror.  For anyone that is heavily intoxicated, I will pray for you.  \n\nSo why the extra star you may ask?  Well the bathroom line was real quick and I did get in the club for free.  However, I'm sure the line was short because people would rather pee on themselves before walking out in the cold and getting lost in the maze that is Marquee. \n\nI felt like Goldilocks and the three bears.  Except that I kept on hoping for the \""just right\"" moment, but it never came and I would have rather been chased out by a bear."
0,"The Fry's Pharmacy is SOOOO slow...  They have great prices compared to CVS but the service at CVS is so much better!  Frys doesn't go the extra mile to help you get the prescription refilled - they make you do all the work.  CVS was willing to make all the necessary contacts.  Also, if the prescription is pricey they don't fill it until you ask for it again a second time.  They just assume you don't want it because it's more than the $4 cheap prescriptions.  The lines for the pharmacy are ridiculous - and very slow!  As long as you have at least 30 minutes to wait in line, it's ok.  For the lower pharmacy pricing you have to weigh the other factors in as well."
0,We had not eaten here for a number of months. So my Daughter and I thought we would have it delivered. We got the Orange Chicken and Beef and broccoli. They both had little flavor and the beef was tuff and grisly.  We also got the hot and sour soup and it also lacked flavor.  Very dissapointed. I don't think I will go back.
0,"Pathetic food, will never go there again... My wife got a severe food poisoning having one of their famous soups..  The food tasted OK but never knew it could become this bad... I just can't imagine that there are so many good reviews, am I the only one who ordered the soup?? Dont know.. Anyway writing this review so that everyone out there can be cautious about this place and the food. \nSad that I had to write a bad review but I just hope no one gets sick from this place again..."
1,"WOW!! WOW!! \nFantastic show...you ask yourself all the time \""how'd they do that?\""....\nreally enjoyed it...\ntip...don't see too far forward...a lot of action is up high...go for the middle"
0,"OMG, this Holt is horrible ! When you're used to the Bay-Bloor one in Toronto, this one looks like a grocery store !!\nThe selection is pretty small and actually not really good either... Example; my boryfriend went there to buy a pair of Tod's shoes, they only carried 3 pairs... 3 pairs !!!! Nothing !!! \nWe waited 15 min to have a snoby, rude saleswomen finally serving us... Of course, we didn't buy anything and will not spend any penny in that Holt Renfrew, better wait and go to Toronto or in France...."
0,"I had bought a Halloween costume on clearance the previous year, and they didn't take the little plastic thingy off my costume, and I didn't realize it til a year later when I went to put on my Halloween costume and felt the plastic thing. I went back there, (of course, i didn't have the receipt, but the clearance sticker was still there), so I explained that i had bought the costume last year bla bla bla, and that they never took off the thing, The lady started arguing with me that she couldn't just take it off cuz i \""could have just stole it from there that day\""... really lady? Look at all your costume currently in your store, you don't sell this costume this year! I asked to speak to a manager and she says \""I am the manager\"". So i asked her if I could pay for it again for her to take it off... she agrees... so shes trying to figure out how to ring it up, and couldn't figure it out... then she says 'hold on, I'm gonna get the manager'... Uhm what?! I thought she was the manager? so she gets the manager and the manager just tells her \""take it off, we don't sell the costume anymore, there's no reason to make her pay for it again\"" the girl just stood there like \""really? but but but...\"" the manager was like \""just take it off, give it to her.\"" So I politely thank the manager as the other girl takes the plastic thing off, then I couldn't help but say \""I thought you said you WERE the manager!?\"" and she says \""well, i'm the assistant manager\"" I haven't been there since. What a joke!"
0,":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("
1,Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.
1,"We stopping in on Friday about 5:00 just to check it out. Harveys is a neighborhood dive. It felt like Cheers when we walked in. People at the bar (customers) said Hi and the waitress was right to us with menus and very friendly. OK, don't expect much in decor. The tables are sticky, like when the varnish is sticky and you can never get it clean enough to not be sticky. We had drinks very nice martinis. The bartender is a pro. I had a BLT, thin sliced bacon, crispy and just the right amount and my partner had a burger, both were excellent. \nAs we left the bar crew all said bye as well as the staff. I liked the folks there."
0,Food look like it was jst tossed on plate and plate looked like a kids meal.not to mention i waited an hour for an appetizer tht ddnt even come with plates.horrible service
0,"I had high hopes for this Zipps location.\nPositives: bigger bar, nice patio, TVs galore!\nNegatives: food ( had to take my wings back twice and they still couldn't get it right). My sister ordered the focaccia which was cut in tiny pieces on a cold as ice pita. Customer service was like pulling teeth. We sat for more than twenty minutes waiting on refills. As much as I love their wings, I might go somewhere else on mill with better service who will get my order right."
0,"What happened guys, went back after about 2 months since you opened and the food really was not good. The nasi goreng was bland and more than a third of my plate was prawn crackers, which are on the menu for a giant bowl for \u00a32. Think of 5 or 6 prawn crackers spread out on a plate yep they take up a fair ammount of space! The prawn crackers seeemed to be the main stay for \u00a311 with the Satay and Nasi an after thought I really wasnt impressed. The sushi rice for the maki was just bizzarre, watery and it felt like the rice had been through a blender. The missus had a veggy option for nasi goreng and that was just odd. She ordered the same dish at christmas and it was great. I grew up in Indonesia so know my Asia food, when I tried her dish the first time we visited it took me right back to my teens. This time round it was bland. Our first experience was excellent the second was .... dire to mediocre.  We had a party of 12 or so for a birthday celebration and the dishes took ages to appear as did drinks. We were left sitting for extended periods with no drinks and no food.... think 45 minutes between starter and main.  I gave up waiting on our order and went to the bar  and the bar service was the slowest I think I have experienced in Edinburgh loads of people just faffing around without actually doing anything except one guy who looked harassed as you would expect. Sorry I wont be back!"
1,"Gluten free! I love this place. I can't eat everything her including the fries and the gluten free bun didn't fall apart! The staff was friendly and happy. The shakes were to die for. This is our new go to spot for sure! It has a drive through as well, which is pretty convenient. I'm telling everyone I know about this place. So good!!!"
0,"Very disappointing. \n\nCame early Saturday evening, around 5:30, and it was packed.  Wait for a table for 2 was 45 mins. You can't make reservations despite what their (infuriating and confusing) automated answering machine said.\n\nOk, no problem.  I'm willing to wait for good food and to try a new place.  Luckily, we snagged two seats at the bar within 10 mins.  It was all downhill from here...\n\nCocktails were awful.  They don't carry Tito's, so I went with a Stoli (up with a twist).  Not good.  The perfect vodka martini should be ice cold with shards of ice crystals and citrus oils.  Mine was cold-ish... and had a thick awkward corkscrew of rind balanced on the rim.  Whatever.  We moved on to the specialty \""cockytails.\""  DIABETES. seriously. we tried the blueberry skinny tea and cool as a cucumber and they both tasted like sugar water.  The one/only good thing was the jalapeno bacon moonshine.  We took shots of that and I would recommend.  Very jalapeno-y and bacon-y and... yah, first time I've had a savory shot and I liked it.\n\nFood was mediocre to awful.  We were about to order the fried okra when the people next to us said it was bad.  My friend tried some of the neighbor's  -- mushy and bland and gross.  Biscuit was undercooked and unimpressive. Appalachian egg rolls were dripping with oil, yet not crispy (I imagine the oil wasn't hot enough), and just meh.  Shrimp and grits were fine... but nothing special.  The fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries were also fine... but it was no different from what I could have made in 5 mins. on any given weekend morning.\n\nService was obviously lacking because the place was slammed and we were at the bar.  Let's go with \""N/A\"" here.\n\nWe opted to skip dessert.  I just don't get how there's so much hype surrounding this place.  \n\nTL;DR -- Wait for table is long; cocktails will give you diabetes; food is mediocre."
0,"On august 22, 2013 I received a letter from JP Quijano, a claim professional affiliated with WinCo Foods stating;\n\nPlease be advised that a claim arose involving a WinCo Foods customer (me) purchased your dog treats, specifically rawhide and pig ears, from our store and alleges that consumption of both treats was the cause of his dog's death. Our client did not make any modification to your product. As such, we have determined there is no apparent liability/negligence on our client.\n\nAnother words, when asking WinCo Foods for compensation in the death of my dog, they would just rather pass the buck to the manufacturer and not take any responsibility for the products and or how they are displayed and handled in there stores.\n\nMy dog's death could have been a tax right off to WinCo, for my vet bills where more than what I was asking for.  Then this bad review and the poor customer service could have been avoided.\n\nThis claim took from 02/02/2013 date of loss to 09/09/2013, for me to speak to someone (the manufacturer) for this matter to be taken care of in a professional manner. If I didn't care as much about my dog to take the time and to call and call about this matter, it would have been forgotten and that is how I feel WinCo Foods wanted it, after all it was just a dog that died. I feel WinCo Foods should have handled this whole situation different for better customer service and maybe in the future they will."
0,"I hate leaving a \""meh\"" kind of review for an organization that does a lot of goodwill and charity, but Goodwill thrift stores are not on my shopping radar at all. I feel like their prices are overpriced and their merchandise is poorly organized. I'll donate items to Goodwill because I know they're doing good somewhere, but I won't shop there. I recommend Savers, Opportunity Village and the Charleston Outlet thrift stores instead."
1,"I loved this restaurant.\nI travel all over the country and always eat Indian if I can.  Vegetarian friendly.  Gluten Free friendly.\nCasual atmosphere.\nThe staff is overwhelmingly nice, warm, friendly.  By the time we left, I felt like they were friends.  I let them pick out my food using my Gluten Free restrictions and was amazed with my meal.  The Bhel Poori was so unique and filled with flavor.  The dosa tasted like the dosa's that I ate in India.\n\nThe owner(s) sang songs and entertained us unexpectedly.  We meant to pop into the restaurant for a quick meal.....we left feeling like we had a casual night out on the town with new friends.\n\nGo eat at Pyaars!  Then go back.  This place is near a movie theater and is so new that it had no sign yet.  Find it...it will not disapoint!"
1,"I had dinner reservations for a Tuesday evening for 7:00 pm via open table. Once entering the dining room my senses were mesmerized by the aroma of the kitchen and stove which is in the center of the restaurant.  I was seated asap and my friendly waitress took my order for a glass of red wine and having reviewed the menu earlier in my room I placed my order for my tapas, this is what I ordered:\n\nThe hmmus and tahini served with bread baked from the stone oven - very good \nBrussel sprouts with capers, almonds and vinaigrette - light and flavorful delicious.\nPork Belly - crisp on the exterior with just the right amount of seasoning - tender & juicy.\nLamb Shawarma - Not gamey, tender and seasoned with a hint of curry.\nGrilled Octopus - Celery, potatoes and lemon vinaigrette. Bomb so tender!\nClam & Noodle - Awesome finishing tapas - generous portion and so delish.  \nFig & Almond Pannacotta - OMG, HAPPY ENDING! \n\nOverall the food was stellar, service was solid and the interior decor is sexy and swanky! No wonder this is the top five of reservations made on open table. I'll be returning here again!"
0,"Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there."
1,"WOW this is by far the best selection of flavors and best tasting ice cream ever. I highly recommend this ice cream parlor, they have boba and are open til 2AM!"
1,"On a BUDGET? Eat at Teharu!\n\nNooo I'm not advertising for them but if your in need for a quick fix of sushi, well then grab a seat at Teharu! Their sushi is cheap, in small portions, and well its CHEAP! Good for college kids on a tight budget. Service is ok and could be improved but...its CHEAP so its works out! Its not exactly a place to order your over the top sushi filled with tons of ingredients but it'll do. \n\nGood atmosphere for all ages. Not really a place meant to impress the boss or something...unless their clueless of how sushi is delivered to you on a conveyor belt...hmmm on a second thought, maybe it will."
1,"I've gone through too many accountants in my day, for some reason I just can't like them.  They are either too pushy, have no sense of humor or just suck at what they do. \n\nI was recommended to Paul from someone else and I haven't been happier.  I don't think anyone likes to see their accountant because it usually means that you have to pay money to someone, either to them or the IRS, but it's life.  Paul has always been there and has helped me with any questions I have and doesn't nickle and dime you.  \n\nHighly recommend Paul and team if you run a small business, or just want someone to professionally look after your taxes."
0,"Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up... It is a restaurant right, it's what you do? \nToo bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food."
0,I   was given the bate and switch routine that sleazy car dealers are known for  and I would never recommend CardinaleWay Mazda Peoria Az to anyone
1,"John Lewis, your friend and mine, it's always good for a browse and their good quality products all come with a money back guarantee if there are any faults or problems which is reassuring to know.  I'll usually pop in to browse the make-up department as they have a great selection and the staff are always very knowledgeable about the products giving tips and samples too. \n\nSometimes the shop assistants can be old sour puss types that can't smile with the amount of premium brand make-up cemented onto their faces but I've rarely had any problems here and find that most of the staff can't do enough to help."
1,"Service is impeccable. Our barista was so friendly and down to earth. In addition to providing honest menu recommendation, he happily shared his insight of Montreal culture with us. Between my friend and I, we ordered:\n- Hot taro milk tea with tapioca\n- Hot ginger tea with tapioca\n\nWhile this was my first experience with with hot bubble tea, I've had my fair share of bubble tea in my lifetime. NosThes easily served THE freshest bubble tea I've ever tasted. The barista took his time steeping our tea (yes we oversaw the process as the other barista chatted up with us) and carefully crafted our beverages. The tapioca texture was on point; it had just the right amount of \""glutinous chew\"" without that horrible \""stuck in my teeth\"" feeling. What surprised us most was that no powder was involved during the making. It was apparent that the slightly higher price was worth every penny; the flavour actually tasted natural/real and our option of choosing less than 50% sugar brought out the natural flavours of fresh ginger/taro without being intrusive to the palette. I tasted real taro chunks and the hearty, graininess of the warm plant was truly something unexpected from this small joint in Gay Village.\n\nWe did not order any food there so can't comment on quality in that department. Definite must if you're a bubble tea fan or if you're seeking an alternative cafe experience from your old standby. I will definitely return if I travel to Montreal again!"
0,"friendly service, but very disorganized. Took them over an hour to serve us our dinner even though they weren't that business. I don't think they had any designated server to look after our table - so it all depended upon one very harried guy remembering to come by every half hour to check if were doing ok.\nChili Rellenos was subpar and the special that my wife had (mahi tacos) was over done.\nThe staff were really trying and seemed to care , but totally mis-managed and dis-organized or perhaps understaffed.\nThat was kinda disappointing since the food and service at the Los Dos in mesa used to be pretty good....."
0,Hooters restaurant is like it is everywhere.  Crap.  The ladies had no hooters themselves.  The food is never great.  The hotel room was not great had an iron burn on the carpet rooms need to be updated and they charge u for drinks when your gambling.  Ok if you can get the room really really cheap
1,"The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time."
1,"Decent service, and good food. I like their happy hour. I wouldn't come here if I was starving but portion sizes are adequate."
0,"I moved to Montreal almost a year ago and was told that I should try Scores as I like rotisserie chicken. We have Swiss Chalet where I was from. Finally got to try this place out at the Place Vertu location. The night started off on a good note but ended not well for me (my husband enjoyed his meal). \n\nThough I usually order the quarter chicken with white meat, I decided I was craving the dark meat more after our workout at the gym. So we both ordered the 2 chicken legs dinner. We were told it would take about 15 minutes, which is fine with us because in my mind, that means the chicken should be freshly made. \n\nBecause the meal includes unlimited soups, salads and fruit from the salad bar, we headed there first. I really enjoyed the chicken noodles soup and lentils soup. The salads I chose we're good as well, though the mushrooms looked wilted. \n\nThen when our meals came, we noticed we only received 1 leg of chicken each. When we pointed this out, the waitress said that if we order another one and can't finish it, we would have to pay an extra $3 each (even though it was only supposed to cost $2.50 each leg according to the menu). I have never heard of this. On top of that, she should have mentioned this at the beginning or have it written on their menu. I told my husband I would have ordered the chicken breast had I known this, but shrugged it off. The waitress checked on us after we received our meal and asked how everything was and we indicated it was good (I liked their fries and that was all I had so far). But then I tried the chicken and noticed it was dry. I noticed my husband almost finished his chicken and told him mine was dry and said that his was really moist. The server never came around again to even fill up our water. When it was time to leave, my husband asked if we can pack up was was left of portion of chicken and half of his baked potato and her response was let her check and that was the last straw for me. I told her the reason there was chicken left is because it was dry. Instead of apologizing and asking if I would like another piece, she turned the tables around and said that it was my fault for not mentioning that when she came around to ask if everything was ok. I explained that at that point I had only tried the fries. She said that's not an excuse. I was floored but made sure I did not hear it wrong. I have never been spoken to by a server of any restaurant whether its a fast food or high class restaurant. Needless to say my husband still gave her a good tip because he enjoyed his meal, but I told him I never want to go to that place ever again."
0,"This place was terrible. My wife and I stayed here years ago. RIP. Only good thing about this place is my wife and I staying here when we first met. Thats it. Its was cheap compared to the rest of the hotels on the strip. The out side was typical, with a average decor."
0,"While having a good bit of time for a layover, we were looking to shift it into a Latin-American gear a little early before our flight to Puerto Rico out of the Charlotte airport. \n\nThe tables were clean, and the server was extremely pleasant and attentive, but the food was really not the bee's knees. We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla. \n\nThey did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food)."
1,Thank you so much for making my husband's birthday party such a wonderful success.  We had the most delicious salad (greek was amazing) pizza (all fantastic) and stromboli (delicious and our 1st time having one)  The owner was so helpful and generous with us and we loved our meal so much.  We look forward to visiting Las Vegas again and having Biaggio's delivered to our hotel room!!!
1,"I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...\n\nWhen I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.\n\nPersonally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.\n\nThe soup is always great.  The service is also nice."
1,"Although when I did go it was busy making me wait a long time , I think this place has wonderful employees. Customer service is great. Although some people have very lil patience , the guys don't let any of that get to them ."
1,"Went twice recently, once for dinner and once for brunch. Did NOT have Red Velvet waffles--much as I love sweets, the very notion of those waffles makes me queasy--but all at my table ordered either breakfast or lunch items and all were quite pleased. My omelette was well-made, just enough without being the gluttonous portion some restaurants feel obligated to serve. \n\nThe dinner was likewise done well and all in our party were pleased. I did order one of the desserts, which took an inordinately long time to arrive at the table and was still cold from the fridge and more than a little dry (a coconut cake). I wouldn't order a dessert again, knowing now that they're pre-fab and sitting around in the freezer until ordered, but I also don't hold that against them.\n\nService was better at dinner than brunch but both servers were pleasant, engaging and professional. \n\nWe will definitely return, which is not what we said long ago when we last left the old Village Bistro. I think we will begin to incorporate this into a dinner-and-a-movie evening routine, which includes the Ballantyne movie theater upstairs (and which requires a whole different review)."
1,"Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!"
1,"Nice selection of items, good pricing and friendly atmosphere. We'll be back."
1,BF took me here for a small celebration.  It was by far the best dining experience of my life.  \n\nExtra attention to detail across the board.  Culinary professionals need to visit here and be pampered then work here and there would be no need for yelp.  Everything would be perfect in the restaurant world.\n\nThe Sommelier was very helpful and spoke to me on my level despite the obvious depth of knowledge.
0,"Esthetically pleasing but the service is absolutely terrible ...\n\nI was told by the bartender at Holsteins: \""it's 1:30 am in Vegas, expect to spend some money\"" (because HE didn't tell me that in order to sit in a booth, each guest had to purchase $20 worth of food and drink). \n\nThis same person at Holsteins pocketed my 54 cents in change and did not give me a receipt. When I asked for a copy of my receipt I was told: \""I will have to dig it out of the trash\"" --- I did get a copy of my receipt and their trashcans must be sparking because my receipt was spotless and crisp.\n\nI was going to let this slide because I thought that after I told the floor manager (of the floor we were staying on) about this issue, he would do as he said and \""discuss this with the management team and make things right\"" but I didn't ever hear back from him, nor have I heard back from the hotel after I got home and emailed them about this experience (I waited one week and now I'm here letting y'all know not to waste your money here). \n\nAlso similar to other people's reviews: \nOur telephone didn't work - they had to replace it TWICE. \nDespite me informing them several times that a lamp didn't work, they didn't pay any attention to it. \n\nGO ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Great atmosphere & great beer but it took 45 minutes to get our food. When I walked in I was immediately impressed. Crowded restaurant on a Friday night, a great sign. There was a guitarist playing & the place was buzzing. The waitress recommended getting the beer sampler & I wasn't disappointed. The Dirty Blonde Ale & the Heffeweisen in particular were fantastic. When my friend arrived we ordered food & begin to chit chat & have a good time. After about a half hour we began to wonder where our food was. When the waitress started to avoid us we knew something was wrong. Finally after 45 minutes our food arrived.  My burger was decent but a little dry; it certainly wasn't the medium rare that I had ordered & it was definitely not worth the wait but after 45 minutes and some beer sampler I really needed some food. The waitress said they were unexpectedly busy. I may give them another chance just to see if she was right or if they've worked out their kitchen issues....& to try the beer again."
0,"I'd rather have a bottled drink than ever order their smoothies ever again. I tried lychee smoothie and it was SO sweet, it didn't taste authentic or fruity at all. In fact, it just tasted like milk and sugar. Tons of sugar. My friend disliked his thai tea as well, TOO MUCH SUGAR. The reason why I find it so sweet is because my regular boba spot is Tea Station, and their lychee snow is JOYGASMIC.\n\nI will say that I loved the sandwich I ordered, which was bbq pork. I don't mind raw onions and the spice, it was good. My phone picked up wifi there, but it does require a password. I didn't inquire about it since I'm not there to surf the internet.\n\nMy friend also ordered beignets- now beignets are basically french donuts. Fried dough. WTF LEE'S. You come up with mini sweet pita pockets. When you bite into it, it's just.... empty. I really don't know if I'm going to go back. The place is so pretty at first glance, but it's a huge mindxuck.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention. Yes there's plenty of space to sit down. But it's not like anyone wipes down tables or clean the floors. Every table had at least some crumbs, and the floor under the table we sat at was so dirty. Shoe grime. Didn't catch it until we finally left. Blehh. =/"
0,"What a disaster for lunch.  Arrived at 12:20 for lunch with a party of 11 and when we got there we were the ONLY people on the whole restaurant.  This was a business lunch and a big party so you would think the place would pay attention to us. WRONG.  The waiter was a slow as molasses and once seated it took 10 minutes for him to bring us menus and take our drink orders. Again remember we were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!.   Finally after 20 minutes we order and our drinks some 35 minutes after we sat down.  Meanwhile the waiter and another guy were wiping tables and moving stuff on the patio. Who knows why, no one else was in the place.   After over 1 hour we get our food and several orders were wrong.  He does not apologize and challenges the person saying they changed the order and he brought the correct order.   Finally after over 2 hours we finished and it still took 10 minutes for the server to bring the bill.  No wonder this place was empty. Absolutely horrible service avoid this place like the plague. I will be sure to share this horrible with every possible person to let them know what. Horrible service, inconsiderate wait staff seems to be acceptable for this place. unless you have lots of time to sit and wait avoid this establishment.  Can i give them ZERO stars??? We finally walked out at 2:35!!!!  2:15 hours later....  Prior reveiwers are right that the MIA stands for the waiters being M.I.A."
0,"I did my grocery shopping mostly here while I was on vacation. It got the job done but is nothing special. The produce section was smaller then I would have liked but they have a whole aisle for healthy more organic options. Staff is not very friendly. Meh, gets the job done but nothing to ride home about"
0,"I was feeling nostalgic with my mom and aunt. We hadn't been to Red Lobster since I was a kid. There was a wait. We were cool with that. After about 20 minutes we bellied up to the bar to have a drink while we waited. \nThe bar itself was covered in a thick film of greasy finger prints and beer. I asked the busy bartender for a rag to wipe it. Without responding or looking at us, she was visibly aggravated and half ass wiped the bar, continuing to ignore our many thanks. \nI ordered a $5 beer. The glass was filthy. I'm really not that picky (yes I guess I don't mind drinking beer from a dirty glass) and did not want to irritate her further, so I kept quiet. \nWe were soon seated and I ordered another beer from our server. This time there was a full feather floating in my glass. A feather!!? The server sent the manager over who apologized about sending out 2 nasty $5 glasses of beer. He said he would comp our check. \nWe ordered seafood platters of what can only be described as bagged pre breaded frozen less-than-fast food-quality crap. I would have preferred ANY fast food chain to this food. $20 a plate!?!? Bahaha! I will NEVER spend any money at a Red Lobster again! \nWe had to go to the bar to ask for silver wear after our food came. Our waiter only checked on us ONCE. We complained yet again. It was ok. The manager was comping for the beer at least. \n\n*Ahem* \nHe took $2 off of our bill. \n$2."
1,"For car service, I will definitely recommend Generosity Limo. I needed a ride to the airport...at 4:00 in the morning! I had no options, and this was an important trip. I contacted Generosity, and Dave was very accommodating. He told me it was his pleasure to get me to my destination and that I should expect my driver on time. As an infrequent traveler, I was nervous about being on time because of all the stories you hear about airport security and how much time it takes to get through. Also, I live about an hour from the airport. \n\nI wasn't quite ready to go yet at around 3:50 a.m. when I got a knock on my door that startled me. The driver was early! The car was nice and clean, comfortable, and a smooth ride. The driver was professional and seemed to really care about getting me to the airport on time. I enjoyed the ride and arrived safely with plenty of time to get through security and wait for my flight. Because of my trip to the airport, I believe my trip to Michigan was stress free and very enjoyable.\n\nI would recommend Generosity Limo for anyone who needs car service!"
0,"this was the first Japanese restaurant I've tried out in Arizona, and I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I'm from California where the sushi is really good. this place is expensive for sushi quality I would get out of Safeway deli. We were the only ones in the restaurant which should of been warning sign number one. The only really good tasting sashimi was the salmon. \nThe location is decorated in a really strange way and definitely needs to be renovated. It's also very small. Overall, go somewhere else. Not worth it."
1,"This is one of the smaller Guitar Centers I've been to so sometimes they don't have always the stock. However, they have great customer service. The BF and I have just been helped in every section of the store and people have always been nice, helpful. People are patient and thorough about questions. \n\nIn the electronic section we seem to meet eclectic people working here who do DJing or involved in music around town. It's fun to meet other music people and cool to be invited to events we didn't even know occurred or given CDs.\n\n I like that GC does price matching and it's not too far from the house so it's not a big deal if we leave empty handed. We enjoy coming here though because the people are pleasant and interesting."
1,"Awesome show! Terry Fator has definetely earn his spot on the Las Vegas Strip as the headliner for the Mirage. Probably one of the best comedy performances I have seen (And I have seen plenty... like Dane Cook live). \n\nFirst of all, I remember when the 'Terry Fator Theatre' was the Danny Gans' theater. They truly did a great job renovating. Terry Fator Theatre is very modern and plush, with great lighting and a stage that would remind you of a game show set. The crowd is warmed up by other comedy performers and  DJs, who plays a danceable mix of pop songs.\n\nFator uses a series of TV-famous plushy, pop-eyed puppet characters, a crew of Muppets knockoffs. But trust me when I say, they are more entertaining than the muppets (they come closer to Avenue Q style puppets).  \n\nFator shows his expertise in ventriloquism within the first five mins of the show, and his animated and expressive characters are a foundation for his true talent: He's a singing impressionist conjuring the distinctive sounds and styles of Garth Brooks, Rod Stewart, Etta James, Louie Armstrong, Axl Rose and even Elvis.\n\nHe is very interactive with the audience, and performs songs that  everyone in the audience should know. Fator is undeniably talented, likeable and professional, and his act at the Mirage shows to be around for a long time."
0,"Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\"""
1,"Wow, I guess this is the first homemade donut I've ever had? The cruller I had was light & airy but had an actual taste to it. Not just sugar and dough. This is a place that gives Vegas a hometown pulse. The owners seem very nice.\n The location itself is kind of easy to miss. It's an older strip mall and parking is weird. Just sort of be careful getting in and getting out of the place. Look for the big white best of banner out front.\n *IT'S CASH ONLY!!!"
0,"When we first moved to Arizona we lived in Ahwatukee and Abacus Inn was on restaurant of choice on Elliot and 48th.   Fast forward 20 years and one pops in closer to us so we thought we would give it a try.  \nI liked it, she didn't.  It wasn't the same as we remembered.  Maybe we aged.  Maybe they did.  The place is tiny and packed.  There appears to be a brisk take-out business happening.   The menu appears to be \""lite\"" on menu options and not like other Chinese joints where there are endless pages of options.  \nWe preferred Shanghai on 67th and Happy Valley (in the Fry's shopping Center) as our favorite Chinese in the Northwest side.  \nThere is some serious commentary needed and it's how these Chinese restaurants seem to make take out orders, over in restaurant orders.   They must teach them that in Chinese Food school but I have seen full packed restaurants of people waiting up to an hour + for food, while the take out is brisk.  I have seen people walk in, order takeout and then sit and eat it whiles others wait.   I'm not sure why they do this, but all Chinese joints seem to partake in this mistake."
0,"I read some of the reviews and it looks like service is still a huge problem. Hubby and I stopped in to watch the NCAA Final 4 game while having dinner. We found a table and waited a few minutes until someone came by to get our drink order. We're non-drinkers and when we asked for tea, our waitress gave us THAT look that we're used to seeing. I wanted to tell her to not judge us because we don't drink. We're good tippers (having spent a combined 20+ years in the restaurant biz). I knew immediately we were going to be in for a bad evening and I was right.\n\nShe brought our drinks, took our order and we didn't see her again until we were finished eating. We could have used some ketchup, mustard and a little more salad dressing...along with more iced tea but why bother, right?\n\nI sat facing the whole bar and watched while one of the waitresses busted her butt for 6 large tables in one section as well as a couple of other tables near where we were sitting. Our waitress, on the other hand, hung out by the service area at the bar with no other tables under her watch. I have NO idea why she took us when she was serving the bar on the other side of the restaurant.\n\nSuffice to say the meal was meh. We left before the game was over because the waitress put our check down and said, \"" Need anything else?\"" as she put the bill down and walked away. \n\nSad stuff because I know we could have gone elsewhere and had fantastic service. I wish we had. We won't be back when we're back in Scottsdale. We probably would have had better service at a fast food joint."
0,"What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"

0,Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.
0,"This my third stay in two years.   I can see then trend downward in service and caring.   There are still some caring people here, but most seem to be losing interest in treating patients.  In two. Instances over the past few days,  employees simply shrugged and commented, \""Welcome to Summerlin   I have leukemia, so. I am in and out of hospitals.   This place has finally made it to the bottom of my list.   Still waiting for the sore throat lozenge I asked for an hour ago..."
1,"Ahhh. Delmonico. I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I am in Nevada, for this is my favorite steakhouse. The ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.\n\nWe started out with the truffle and parmesan chips as well as the pork trotter. The chips= simply AMAZING. The chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. The pork trotter was also good, but I believe that it was better the last time I came.\n\nAs for the steak, I ordered their signature bone-in ribeye with a side of spinach. The steak came with butter on top, which I found different because not many other steakhouses included that. The steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.\n\nHowever, I was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. Last time when I was here, I remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best."
1,"There is not a bad seat in this house for a football game.  Seriously!  We had our backs against the wall in the \""nosebleeds\"" to see the Panthers vs Saints December 2013, and had a GREAT time with a wonderful view!  If you think it might rain, bring a poncho; if you think it'll be cold, bring a coat!  Employ common sense, and you'll have a blast!\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... the concession workers STINK on an alarming level.  By and large it takes almost a HALF HOUR to get a drink of ANY sort.  I stood in line for 20 minutes (ALL OF HALFTIME AND THEN SOME) for a diet pepsi... the workers are worse than slow... actually, city workers could give them some tips on efficiency... it's THAT bad if you're not in club-level seating.  My advice?  Eat before you arrive, arrive early, order your drinks, get cozy in your seats, and enjoy the game! :)"
1,"First night of serving on Friday night!  My wife and I happened to drive by and noticed the front window jammed with people waiting for tables.  After months (more than a year?) of delays, the sister restaurant to the legendary Point Brugge Cafe (Point Breeze) has finally opened.  Grand opening on Tuesday 1 February, but a \""soft opening\"" was announced to the Highland Park neighbors earlier this week.\n\nAs you might expect if you've ever seen the reviews of Point Brugge Cafe, Pittsburgh now has another terrific fresh-food restaurant!  And another feather in the restaurant cap for Bryant Street and Highland Park.\n\nThe decor is contemporary -- sleek and simple -- but very comfortable.  It's a boisterous place (some might call it \""noisy\"") so if you're looking for dark, quiet, romantic dinner, this ain't the place for you.  If, however, you're looking for great food in an energized environment, this could your new dining \""home.\""   \n\nI wish I could offer a more extended sense of the menu, but my wife and I both ordered the same thing.  \n\nWe started with a potato/pancetta soup.  It was broth-based, but with just a touch of cream to hold it together.  Light and delicious.\n\nOur entree: herb-crusted salmon over arugula and lentils.  In spite of the fact that we ordered the salmon well-done (not fans of raw fish), the salmon was moist and tasty.   The arugula and lentils were wonderful.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared an order of profiteroles: three crisp, hollow rounds of pastries filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate and, I believe, a bit of caramel.  Again, very flavorful.   Not a fan of chocolate, but whatever they drizzled on the profiteroles was particularly tasty.\n\nFor fans of Point Brugge, the menu includes the steamed P.E.I. mussels and Belgain-style twice-cooked fries with seasoned mayonnaise.  (The family at the table next to us went through two orders of EACH!)\n\nThe service was very good even though it was the first night with customers.  I was told that the cafe hired EXPERIENCED servers, host staff and bartenders.  Congrats to them for thinking through this.  \n\nTo repeat: another tremendous addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and ESPECIALLY to fans of good, fresh food who live in the East End.\n\nMy only disappointment was that I couldn't get an espresso after dinner.  Only traditional American coffee (though it IS PrestoGeorge coffee).  No big deal, though, as I can always wander around the corner to Tazza d'Oro on Highland Avenue. \n\nI didn't pick up the phone number or find a Website for the place.  I hope that other Yelpers can supplement this soon."
0,"Salesman was persistent on trying to update my $19 wash to a $99 detail. He was borderline argumentative and aggressive, I would not recommend this place at all. The entire establishment is ran by shady looking people, it's not a good sign when you look at other customers and they all look nervous. The lady waiting next me mentioned how she would just be happy if all her belongings are still in the car when they were done. :("
1,"Klein aber fein. Wirklich viel Platz bietet das Ohne Gleichen nicht, daf\u00fcr ist es dann um so gem\u00fctlicher wenn man denn einen Sitzplatz abbekommen hat.\n\n\n Die Inneneinrichtung ist spitze und bietet einen modernen Kontrast zur hohen Stuckdecke. Von den den Raum umrandenden roten Sitzb\u00e4nken sollte man sich allerdings nicht t\u00e4uschen lassen - die sind l\u00e4ngst nicht so weich wie sie aussehen.

0,"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied."
1,I consider myself a regular at this point. At the beginning when the location first opened there were a couple of rough spots. Now however I feel the place is a great addition to the Old Town mix. Great bartenders good diverse crowd from 21 to 80 . This is what a real pub should be like. If you don't like the pasty choices try the pasta salad with chicken. So happy to see no TVs .
1,"We were actually referred to Valley King by an apartment place that we had gone to that we were not quite a great fit at, and told to ask for Scott.  We were in the office for about a half hour filling out forms, etc., before he sent us out to look at three places.  We never made it past the first place he sent us...it was a perfect fit.\n\nThe biggest thing that helped them help us was that we were entirely upfront about ALL of the issues we were facing.  Scott was friendly and personable and found a quick location for us.  We appreciated his services and will be using him again."
0,"Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have."
1,"I HATE breakfast food... And I like this place :) I have found that after a night out, everyone always wants breakfast foods. This is a great place to take your breakfast-loving friends and still get what you want!\n\nMust try:\nMuffins- They are to die for! Try the banana nut, AWESOME!\nCincinnati Chili- It certainly isn't Skyline, but at least they are trying :) \nFruit Plate- Fresh and someone else did all the work cutting it up for me. \n\nSkip:\nSalads - I have tried two different salads here. Although there is enough to feed a family of 4, bigger portions don't make a better salad. I found the chicken really boring and dry. I will be trying something different next time. \n\nThe service: It has always been the same. I get greeted by a friendly person, served by an even friendlier person and bid goodbye by an even friendlier friendly person. I think they have conquered good service. I love their happy eggs on the table :)"
0,"It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!"
1,"This place has the Bomb green beans.  This actually has turned into a spot for hubby and I to go to when we want to cruise the downtown scene.  \n\nI highly recommend you get here before everyone gets off work, because like any other downtown metor area, parking will be limited.  \n\nAmbiance is what you should expect, dark/dim lighting, loud music, and crowded.  Not too big of a deal because you will be so busy concentrating on demolishing your food any way.  \n\nWe have only been here 2 times and we have yet to try so many options here.  There are so many different pizza combos to try, that you better bet we are coming back to eventually try it all.   \n\nThe combinations of flavors that they put on their pizza is awesome.  Don't be afraid to add more protein...it might add that added Yum to your pizza.  Whats important to me when I eat a pizza, its the crispiness of the crust.  Thats exactly what you get, a nice crispy pizza. \n\nThis place is a must try!"
1,"This is a fun place to go. The owner bubbles with enthusiasm and will be very happy to discuss her dishes as much as you like. Our party of four had pig ears, chicken Algarve (thin chicken filet with cheese and mushrooms and spices, baked chicken, and chicken on a shish kabob; the first chicken dish and the pig ears were the best in terms of flavors. Unfortunately, they were out of the Portuguese Chorizo and we didn't try any of the more exotic dishes. Everyone liked everything. I plan to go back and try some of their seafood dishes. \n\nI notice reviews cover the spectrum on the Sangria. The owner asked us if we would like a liter of Sangria which is a tad more than quart. We're not big drinkers and we hesitated. The owner assured us it was a light drink; she said she just put a little port wine in and no Vodka; she acted like making Sangria with Vodka was very unauthentic. So the four of us shared a liter of Sangria. The Sangria tastes good but I judged the alcohol content to be substantially less than that of a typical red wine. So order the Sangria if you would like a light alcohol drink with great flavor and order wine if you want something with more bite. \n\nWhen we ordered, the owner told us that one of the dishes would take at least 35 minutes since it was being made from scratch. We were up for a leisurely Sunday evening meal with good company so that was not a problem for us and spent about an hour and twenty minutes there. Of course, if you are on a tighter schedule, ask what can be prepared fast. \n\nService was attentive without the waitresses introducing themselves and announcing that they would be taking care of us that evening. I prefer it that way.  \n\nI decided on five stars based the pig ears and chicken Algarve, nice atmosphere, leisurely but attentive service and a modest bill: $59 for the four us with tax but before the tip and there was more than enough food."
0,"Seriously?! Such a disappointment. I remember having sonics when i was a kid and not liking it very much. But from always seeing commercials i would think maybe i was wrong and i need to give it another chance one day.. Well, another chance was given while i was in vegas and my gosh i was right all along!! we went late at night and there were boppers hangin out outside being rowdy and noisy and all over the place so that just made it worse. We ordered from speakers that would keep screeeeechinggg and making loud ugly noises. The food was totally just BLAH. I dont even remember what anyone ordered.. I even forgot we went there until i saw pictures from my friends camera, I guess it was not memorable enough that i totally forgot we even went there.. After eating sonics, we all felt like crap... =(\n\nI think the best thing I had there was the cherry limeade drink. No joke.. *sigh*"
1,"Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!"
0,**I'm not eating at a place where they don't practice basic food handling practice.** I paid cash for a lunch special the same person who took my money then started preparing my pizza with out washing his hands. I then asked him why didn't wash his hands first after handling money. He rolled his eyes didn't answer me and left to back. When he finally returned I asked for my money back and I left this place. Feeling bad for the people enjoying there lunch.

0,"I usually go to this Einstein's when I have a buy one, get one coupon. This last time though it was pretty sad. I walk in, there's nobody there to greet me. I stand in the empty line right in front of the register for a good 4mins. Then a lady walks by, I was excited for a minute, but then she didn't say anything and just walked the other way. She handed some food over to a customer and the customer gave it right back saying it was the wrong order. She yelled for her coworker and this other lady came out to assist the situation. They discussed the issue while I was still standing there, at this point I was debating leaving. One of the ladies finally said she would be right with me, so I didn't leave. I put my order in, I was in a hurry so I took it to go. I got back to my work only to find out that the bacon was missing out of my breakfast sandwich. Argh!!! Bad service and no bacon?? It's not even worth the buy one get one!"
0,"Best breakfast place in the area, hands down. Nothing fancy, but they do standard breakfast stuff properly and as expected. There's a bit of a line Saturday and Sunday morning, but it moves quickly.\n\nThey also do a decent lunch, I recommend the Georgia Salad.\n\nUPDATE: I'm less fond of this place -- they screwed up my eggs benny the last couple times to the point of uneatable. I don't go here anymore."

1,"This Oregano's location is always busy, so be prepared for a wait of 30-60 minutes.\n\nI've been here 7 or 8 times for dinner over the past year. The food is always delicious, and the portions are enormous. If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. The Bollo Pasta and Alfredo the Dark are two of my favorites. If you want pizza, go with the Deep Dish -- very rich and flavorful.\n\nI'll be visiting this location many more times during the upcoming year."
1,"Came here with friends for a birthday dessert. Quaint atmosphere with very attentive staff. Tried the Strawberry Kiss, Chocolate Brownie, and profiteroles. Hella good."

1,"Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well."

0,If there is a negative 1 for a review i would say it's belooooow negative! This hotel sucks!!!!!!!!  U book a room 3 months earlier and they still cant guarantee u a room! All the staff are making excuses for the looooooong wait! And they have a bitchy attitude and that makes it more\nAnnoying!!!!! Do not come to\nThis hotel. So ghetto and the service is the  WORST. WORST of the WORST!!!!!!!!!!
1,I like to come here as an alternative AYCE sushi place especially since the prices for AYCE is better than most places. The Sushi is great definitely don't have any complaints. The place is a little hidden in the shopping center but I definitely make it one of my top 3 in Vegas for AYCE.
1,"we spent the first night of my bachelorette party here and loved it so much that we spent our 2nd night here too (after bouncing from rain - totally overrated!). guest list on napkin nights to avoid the cover and i s'pose having a group of 12 buzzed girls helps tooo. be warned about the bathrooms - if you don't close the doors perfectly (they're see-through until you lock it, then turn opaque), everyone'll be watching you (booo, def NOT the best design for drunk peeps that need to pee)."
0,"Poor customer service, especially on the phone. I know it's Home Depot, but the least you could do is introduce yourself when you pick up a phone call instead of just saying, \""hullo.\"" And don't respond with \""yeah, of course!\"" when we ask you if it's Home Depot because you didn't tell us where we were calling in the first place."
1,Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.
0,"Rude, rude, rude.  The clerk today was put out by my business.  My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.

We will be going elsewhere in the future."
0,Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you.
1,"I just went to this place for the first time today.  I was told they now have a different owner, and from what I hear that is a very good thing!  I really enjoyed the chi-style dogs here.  Originally from Chicago I was very disappointed to find nothing but garbage places out here for dogs, but this place was very good.  All vienna beef with that awsome snap!  and the polish was excellent.  I don't know how it was before but I can say now, this place is very good and so far its the best I have found out here that reminds me of home."
0,"I'm rating this a three star for my overall experience with this casino in general. The first time I've ever been here was just for the buffet. The BF said he's come here since a child with his family and they had the \""best\"" buffet. EH, yea, I'm sure it was back in the days!! It was mediocre. The reason why I'm giving it a three star instead of a one or two is because they had these two amazing ladies who helped us sign up for their rewards program. They were so attentive yet not pushy like the other \""younger\"" strip casino waitresses. \n\nBesides all of the above, I would not stay at this hotel again. I only stayed in Vegas for one night, it was cheap, but saving the extra $40 wasn't worth it. The bed was HARD, the room service and front desk people were not friendly whatsoever. I mean, what happened to those two ladies a year ago?! They also never explained what the room charges were. There were two different taxes, the $14.99 amenity charge which were DID NOT use - asked them if they could waive it because their WIFI didn't even work!! it was SLOWER THAN A SNAIL..... \n\nOH their shower head leaks and sprays water EVERYWHERE and if you didn't know what the hell to do, you're basically SOL (you had to turn the shower head left and right so stop the spraying. As for LADIES, beware, they have the worse lighting to do make up - it's a incandescent light which makes it yellow, but it was the worse one ever to where, you couldn't even tell if your foundation/powder blended well, so that was a total bummer to go out without knowing if my make up was ok or not. \n\nThe only reason why we really take this 20 min drive out this way, is because we like the outside environment. It makes it feel like you're home because the grocery store, CVS, local restaurants are all down the same street. Beats spending a fortune for one meal. \n\nAlthough, I wish they had a microwave/fridge in their deluxe rooms. EH, like I mentioned before, this was a BUST. Will not stay here again..AND I change my mind, it's now a 2 instead of a 3. That's how sad I am about this place. Such a disappointment."
0,"This place has everything I could want in a rad burrito joint, but good burritos: hard beans (with watery bean juice); mushy flavorless rice; skimpy on the meat innards. Get anything but...      (the burrito)\n\nI do like the other menu items, but a burrito joint MUST have good burritos."
1,There is a special place in my heart for Dean & Deluca. This location is nestled close to my family's home so I come here pretty often with my mom.\n\nAt times can be pricey but you're in a D&D... \n\nAt the deli I usually split the turkey sandwich with avocado and alfalfa sprouts (HUGE) and split one of their salads too...heaven!\n\nSit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful Charlotte weather.
0,"First off a came in and the guy didn't acknowledge me, and when he thought it was a decent time to ask me if I needed help. I told him that I called for tires cause I had a flat then, the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so I waited for them to finish and he said how can I help you again and I said I would like a tire, then he asked for my keys said have. I been here before then said you can sit down now. If I wasn't form another city I wouldn't have come but I'm in a tight situation so I had to bite the bullet. Never again tho"
1,Dawn is the best.
0,"Avoid this location, especially on the weekends. The Apache location has much better customer service! Today they estimated half an hour to replace a tube, which already seemed like a long wait, and said that they would call when it was ready. It took an hour and a half, and no one ever called. Ridiculous. Either go to the Apache location during the week, or figure out how to do the repairs yourself."
1,"I really like the convenience of drive thru Starbucks, but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car. They are friendly and always get my drink right."
1,"This Denny's is the best looking,friendly,and cleanest I have ever been in,there is a bar with about four flat screen TV. tables and stools that seats about 20 to 25 people,the deco in the bar area is very stylish,also they serve there frozen drinks too this is strange they have a place inside that says photo booth that you can take pictures, outside I can see but inside I don't see,try the blooded mary garnish with celery /lime and strip of bacon and side car of horse relish $6,00 so forget the food come here for the bar,its also a great place to people watch with an enclosed patio,I did eat breakfast here before I hit 15 SB"
0,So disappointing.  I was expecting so much but my salmon was so bland and dry that I didn't finish it.  My friend said her chicken was just on edge of being bad.  Meaning with a slightly off taste. I could make a better salad but my friend said her soup was good.  After dinner we thought we were being kind to move to the bar so our server could seat someone else at her table.  Turns out the bartender didn't take kindly to our sitting there (not busy at the bar) and suggested we should go somewhere else if we weren't going to order more wine.  After a bottle of wine at dinner and spending over $100 I think we should have been okay to sit for 30 minutes.\n\nI won't be back.
0,"I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. \n\nThe first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. \n\nI then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?\"". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up. \n\nAt this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. \n\nAt that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. \n \nI left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do. \n\nI'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. \n\nHere's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. \n\nThis veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? \n\nThe only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly."
0,"Cockroach crawled out of sprout plate... Killed it, hesitated to stay but did. They apologized, replaced food, charged me every cent for my food n to-go dinner. Used to come here every week, my fav pho diner, but I think I'll drive a little farther to Chinatown from now on..."
0,"Meh.... \n\nLet's start with the positives:  Our server was friendly and awesome.  The cornbread served in the cast iron pan was rustic and fresh (piping hot from the oven).  The food presentation was pretty and appealing.  The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.  It probably isn't usually this crazy.  The prices are middle of the road.\n\nThe negatives:  Too bad the food did not taste as good as it looked.  Everything seemed to need some salt and they used the same slaw in the ahi bites appetizer as in the fish tacos I ordered.  This homogenous taste experience left much to be desired.  Why they serve fish tacos rolled in a gummy flour tortilla is a mystery.  If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.  The gummy flour tortilla stuck to my teeth and top of my mouth.   I ate 2 pieces this way and eventually just took my fork and gutted the two remaining pieces and the experience was much better.\n\nI guess I am used to real Mexican food and enjoy good Cali-Mex and Tex-Mex.  However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.  I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\n\nMy sister chose this restaurant.  I definitely will not return on my own volition."
0,Older but comfy.  Great for the you get crowd.be sure to eat at the Taco & Tequila bar!
1,"Best taco I've ever had in my life.  PERIOD.  The price is so far below the astronomical prices of the Strip it isn't even funny.  Authentic, friendly and excellent food quality make this place the best and one of the cheapest meals I've ever had in Las Vegas.  Bravo!"
1,Great vet clinic. They have full service including a fabulous groomer.
1,The Cheesecake Factory owns this cafe.  The food is always good and the prices are what you would expect.  They are open 24/7.  The wait staff is nice.
0,"This place lacks a lot of customer service skills. I waited several minutes to place my order or even be acknowledged. When I finally was acknowledged there wasn't even a, \""hello, how can I help you?\"" It was more like, \""what do you want?\"" Then, when I left there wasn't even a, \""thank you,\"" or any sort of parting salutation. \n\nI was really disappointed in the sandwich. There was a good amount of meat but too much bread and not enough dressing."
0,"There's not much to say about Blizz, except that they offer what they say they offer (froyo and smoothies), albeit it at a bit of a higher price than I'm used to. I ended up going with the acai berry smoothie, which was pretty much what I expected, albeit a bit steep at an $8 starting price (and nearly an additional $1 for any boosters). It was okay, if a little bit on the bland side, and the protein powder seemed pretty weak relative to other smoothies I've had that usually have that boost.\n\nThe service was fine and quick, but if you are looking for something new or unique, Blizz is just your generic (albeit overpriced) smoothie and yogurt joint. There has to be a Pinkberry (or something similar) somewhere else on the Strip that would be better."
0,"Scam. For profit, non accredited scam school. You are better off spending $90.000.00 on mega bucks."
0,"The pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about. Otherwise, everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip. There are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior. Skip this place and try somewhere else."
0,"My girlfriend and I went to this place because we heard such good reviews. We walked in on Saturday afternoon and there were a few people there so we were seated fairly quick. Thats the highlight. The waitress took a while to get to us. I am not sure if she was the only one there but if thats the case they need to hire more people. When she finally came over we both order the scrambled eggs w/ potatoes and peppers. We thought this would fill us up. When it came out the whole thing was inside of a very small cast iron skillet. I was speechless. I decided to give it a chance and boy was I disappointed. Flavorless, and way too hot. No amount of salt or pepper would save it.  My girlfriend was still hungry so she ordered a side of potatoes.  She said they were okay, but I did not try them. I was too mad about this \""culinary crime\"" that had been perpetrated on me.  The decor was even questionable.  I have no clue what this place is trying to be. Is it a bar, a restaurant, a lounge, an eclectic hangout for non-conformist. Whatever it is it is not for me and I will not be going back."
0,"My family and I came twice during the week we were staying at the Mandalay bay hotel. The first time we sat over 10 minutes without anyone coming over, then my mom had to go up to the bar to get someone over. Finally 5 minutes later someone came\nOver and took our order then we never saw him again. Two nights later we decided to try it again because the food was good and we waited at our table for a server for over 5 minutes and our table was 1 out of 5 in the whole restaurant. We had terrible service and was charged for a meal we didn't even order/get, then we were told there was nothing they could do about it after charging our card (by another server because ours was too busy). Finally a manager fixed it and dropped off bill. We never saw our server after our food was dropped off. I've been a server for 6 years and am very understanding but this was awful, a manager wasn't even sent over to apologize or anything. Long story, short.. Great food, terrible service."
1,Lots of food for the money! They are fast and food good...our favorite it the beef chimi and asada fries! Both are huge! Staff is always friendly.
1,"Only stayed here one night but I was very impressed!  It was a Saturday night in November and I was able to score a rate of $114 for a king size room.  Not bad!  I didn't think it had much \""curbside appeal\"" but once you get inside it's got lot's of charm and appeal.  \nI really didn't explore the property much because I was there for a limited time but the room was really cool and creative.  If I was back in the area I would definitely stay here again and check out more of the property."
1,"Our pooches look adorable! I am so pleased with the way both my dogs look and also how they were treated! Hunny is my 13 yr old Italian Greyhound, and Twinkle is my 1 yr old toy poo mix. Both dogs were so happy and not stressed at all when I picked them up. The ladies that work here were so nice and attentive. I was taking my dogs elsewhere and tried LuLu's for a change, as long as the service remains this stellar, we will be coming here excusively from here on out!"
0,"What a Capital Grille! This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least - we had an awful seafood tower - the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act."
1,"Want a pint in a good bar on Leith Walk without any hassle?  Look no further than The Brass Monkey.\n\nThis pub has the feel that you're still in your own living room with comfy sofas that you'll have to peel yourself off but obviously it is a bar which means no washing up or cleaning the next day:)\n\nFriendly locals, comfy atmosphere and fairly cheap drinks - it'd be rude not to!"
0,"Not a good cab company to take to the airport.  Even when booking in advance they will not give any notice if they can not make the requested pickup time.  Calling dispatch after no cab arrived was very unsatisfying, they stated that the pickup time is just an estimate window give or take 20min. and that I should have planned accordingly. What? Thanks for nothing."
0,"I am not impressed with the Mondrian at all. I have stayed here 4 or 5 times and each time left with a irritated feeling and an empty pocketbook. \n\nThe rooms are upwards of $300 bucks a night.. For that you would expect them to be decent... When you first glance in at the black and white interior you find it modern and sleek, pretty swanky. Upon further investigation you realize it is all a scam. They must have went to \""Design on a Dime\"" for ideas, then left because they couldn't afford it. The \""remodeling\"" from the James consists of sheets tacked to the walls and dangly things hot glued to the undersides of the counters, the bathrooms are a joke and I have almost broken the sliding doors (twice.... sober). Also the TV's are too big for the rooms so they must be watched at an odd angle.\n\nThe Skybar over looks the parking lot, how tacky (and hot) is that.\n\nThe pool is a pretentious joke. You should be a beauty queen or at least have an expensive rack.. The cabanas can be rented for $500 a day, for that you get a TV, misters and a couch. I have actually been here on a few occasions because friends have DJ'd and my friend is the bar manager (it always helps to choke down free drinks).. But if I was paying.... Last time my friend ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We knew it would be expensive but $75! They use little penguin wine that you can pick up for 5 bucks... I wasn't even able to get drunk enough to enjoy the underwater speakers.. Ostentatious jerks!"
0,"I have been here twice, both times had an awful experience. I went somewhere else and purchased the same outfit for less than it cost at men's warehouse to buy. That wasn't really the issue, since I was willing to spend the money. The true issue was the lack of customer service.....least helpful salesmen ever...."
0,"***This Courtyard has a lot of the typical Courtyard pluses--complimentary internet, complimentary parking, 24 hr fitness center, decent rooms; however, there are also areas where it does not stack up well to other Courtyard Marriotts (slow internet, smell in the hallways, etc.)***\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is located near The Strip; it sits right next to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the monorail stop.  In many ways, it is very similar to other Courtyard by Marriott locations.  It has complimentary parking, complimentary internet and a 24 hr fitness center.\n\nThe rooms are okay.  While the lobby has been renovated to showcase the new Courtyard by Marriott lobby design (the bistro, the market, the modern seating, etc.), the rooms felt a little dated.  The rooms were still big enough and comfortable enough.\n\nThere were definitely areas where this hotel did not stand up well against other Courtyard Marriotts.  The internet was a little slow.  They do warn you when you log-in and you do have an option of paying an extra charge for fast internet.\n\nAlso, the hallways had a smell to them.  While Courtyard by Marriott is a smoke-free hotel, probably the years when smoking was allowed or simply the proximity to Vegas has resulted in kind of a smoky smell in the hallways.\n\nService was fine.  Prices were not too bad, but you could probably pay a relatively similar amount for a mid-range hotel on The Strip (like Bally's) if you planned ahead.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is probably a step below other Courtyard by Marriott hotels out there.  Also, its location is convenient only if you are spending time a lot of time at the convention center.  If you are planning to spend most of your time on The Strip, it is not that far from the Wynn/Encore, but it is very far from everything else.  If you are coming to Las Vegas for vacation, you should probably try to look online at some of the lower priced hotels (Bally's, Mirage) before settling for this Courtyard by Marriott.\n\nAs mentioned, this Courtyard by Marriott offers free parking; the parking is outside, but it is gated."
1,"We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby,  Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it.  The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!"
0,"JULY 29, 2011 == noticed  the restaurant's  sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here!"
1,"The food was delicious!! \n\nThe line might seem long, but they actually get people in pretty fast.\n\nThey lost our orders, but they compensated us by giving us the 25% locals discount so that was nice. The portions are huge. I got the waffle with bacon in it and it's actually four normal sized waffles with strips of bacon in it. So yummy!\n\nI would highly recommend going here!"
0,"Called in our order, went to pick it up and presented a 20% off coupon I received in the mail.  A male employee started speaking to the cashier in Spanish about the coupon for quite a while.  She very meekly pointed out to me a letter they had printed up and put on the register that the coupon was dine in only, however, the coupon didn't state that on it.  So, obviously they were losing money on the deal (the place was totally empty at dinner time), and decided to change their policy AFTER the coupon was sent out.  I was also offended that the cashier and this other person were speaking about me and my transaction in Spanish in an attempt to hide what they were saying, not sure what the big deal even was, just tell me the coupon is dine in only and leave it at that.  And, after all that, the food was very mediocre, not worth the price.  My daughter wouldn't even eat her food.  We won't be back and I'll make sure to spread the word!"
0,"My boyfriend and I have lived here for a little over a year, and since the first week it's been horrible. We have loud people coming in and out everyday/night since the gates are ALWAYS broken. Bumping their loud music and honking their horns repeatedly. Our roof started leaking when those rain storms were here, took them 3 days to fix, and still hasn't fixed it from the inside. Someone always pulls the fire alarms late at night around 10-11pm. And the dumpsters are always full. People just throw their mattresses and old couches next them and they are there for days. The parking sucks. If you have company over they have to park outside of the complex on the side of the road cause there are NEVER any free spots. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's loud, dirty, and to expensive for what's going on around you. Not worth your money."
0,"Although the base price per night is reasonable, what you aren't told when booking is that you will get hit with resort fees that very depending on how many days you plan on staying. Also their 24 hour Cafe is outrageously priced as well. The first night we got in, my wife and I were so jet lagged that we decided to just stay in for the evening and order something from the Cafe. We each got a Sandwich, a 20 ounce soda, and an order or mozzarella cheese sticks and the total was $45 and change.\n\nThe walk to get to your room is quite a hike as it is all the way in the back. You have to walk through the casino then through their restaurant area, a bar, and finally business center just to get to the elevators. As a heads up, none of the rooms even the High Roller/Executive Suites have any form of appliances such as a microwave or fridge in them. If you wish to have a fridge in your room it is a $25 a day up charge.\n\nThe hotel staff is hit or miss as some were friendly and some were not. We decided to order a movie one afternoon after walking the strip all day so we could rest up for the night. It clearly states that a one time fee of $12.99 would be charged to the room upon ordering.  Although this is a bit pricey for a movie, it is what it is for a hotel. However the following morning my wife checks our bank account and notices a $116 charge from the hotel on our statement. \n\nWhen she went down to figure out what this charge was from the front desk the lady was a bit snotty and stated that they hold $116 on your card in case we wanted to order any other movies or have room service. This was never told to us by the staff nor was it listed on the screen when we made the purchase. She immediately asked for the funds to returned to our bank account and the lady said there was no way they could that do that until we checked out - the system wouldn't allow it. \n\nWhen my wife told me this I was livid so I went down and had my words with the lady. She tried to call my wife a liar by saying, and I quote, \""I never stated we could not return the funds until checkout. Your wife is lying.\"" Whether she was or not, the last thing you want to call a paying customer is a liar. She gave me hassle about refunding the money, but when the dust settled she did. I basically told her she had two choices; either refund the money now or I call my bank and report it as fraud.\n\nAlso be prepared to get flagged down by various staff members to try and entice you to \""win free prizes\"" if you attend their two to three hour time share seminar. No matter how many times we said no thank you they still would hunt us down.\n\nYes the hotel is undergoing renovations which is great for them in the long run, but as current staying guests it sucked for us. Getting woken up to by jackhammers and bulldozers at 6:00 in the morning after getting in late the night prior is not a fun way to start the day.\n\nAll in all if we ever go back to Vegas, this hotel will be towards the bottom of our list of places to stay. You get what you pay for and sometime a bargain deal may be easy on the wallet initially you ended up paying for it in other ways."
1,I am a fan because they do not price gouge.\nThe price of a cup of coffee is the same at the airport\nas it is outside at any other Starbucks.\n\nKudos to Starbucks.
1,"I am so torn on this review...so buyer beware.  The real reason I am giving this place 4 stars is for the hot homemade donuts that they make for desert.  There are also 2 dipping sauces too...a chocolate and a buttery carmel...I love the carmel it takes the donut to another level.\n\nAlso during dinner they put fresh homemade dough pretzels on the table with a butter mustard dipping sauce.  These are really good and a different twist on just throwing bread on someone's table...plus it is the only thing you can get for free at the Wynn.  I feel like a winner!\n\nWe went with the pre-fixed menu and it was a good deal...you could choose a starter, entree and desert for $39.  I went with the rib-eye medium rare...it was suppose to be a peppercorn rub but I was able to get it without it...thank you chef.  The steak was cooked perfectly and came with Mr. Wynn's Special Steak Sauce...wow was it good...I had to ask for more because everyone at my table was dipping all of there food in it.\n\nPersonally the staff is okay here...I would expect to be more impressed with this being a Wynn Property but it seems like the staff here are lacking in training.  I have never seen this place packed in all of the times we have eaten here, so maybe the really good waiters do not want to work here.\n\nMy buddy ordered a calamari starter and it was so fishy I would have thrown it back into the sea.  The waiter asked if it was good and he said yes...but I would have sent it back.  If I had ordered that this place would be getting one star.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese Bites Starter was also amazing too.  But Mac and Cheese Deep Fried better be good.\n\nI also started with the Lettuce Wedge with Blue Cheese and Bacon.  I had no idea that this could be bad.  First there is only one strip of bacon that was cooked two days ago sitting on top.  Maybe the Chef could have diced this up for me.  There was nice chunks of blue cheese but hardly any dressing...so it was very dry.\n\nSo as you can see I am giving this place 4 stars but that is for those amazing donuts...everything else is just really good or really bad.  I should just commit to the 3 stars but I can't do it.  I am just not a 3 star guy.\n\nOn Yelp it says that this place is Italian...there is nothing Italian about this place...there is one pasta dish but nothing else.  In fact, the menu covers ever food choice and is probably more American, then anything else.\n\nThere is also a full bar too, so drink up my friends it is VEGAS!"
1,"I had the \""Whatever Burger\"" and it was Amazing! one of the best burgers I've ever had. and it is the reason that I give the place a high score. Its cramped with limited seating but that kinda adds to the character of the place. but our waitress was kinda lost and confused about the menu and drinks. and took her 20 min to bring a water.\n\nIt is very much worth going to if you have time!"
0,"I've been to Kabuki a few times and have never been that impressed. The service is mediocre, the food is decent at best and the cocktails are nothing special. The ingredients seem semi fresh, but there are definitely way better places in the valley if you are looking for delicious sushi. My suggestions: Ra, Blue Wasabi or Squid Ink (depending on which part of the valley you are in).\n\nIf for some reason my review hasn't changed your mind from going and you find yourself at Kabuki DO NOT order the Sangria, you WILL BE disappointed. As for the food -- I guess there are worse places you could go."
0,Don't know why they call this buffet world famous or award winning!!! It's just a regular buffet nothing special!!!
1,"They did a good job cleaning a coat where other places wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThe reason I took off one star is because the owner originally quoted me $12 and the next day when I picked it up he said $15. It's not the problem with it being $3, the problem is that he did not stick with the quote that he said, he blamed it on a long day of work and did not correctly measure the length of the coat at first. If he told me it was an error, but he would stick with the previous price then that would've been great."
0,"I'll update this review when I have the energy to give to such an undeserving establishment and experience. In the meantime please just know I will never return again.  Horrific experience... I received the information to write their corporate office and will update this review when I get a response from there.  In short, they made my 10-year old son cry, falsely accused us of not belonging there after spending approximately $50 to be there with the tickets and receipts up prove it and by the time we proved they were mistaken they actually forced us to leave because them trying to figure out what was going on was causing a \""disturbance\"" in the theatre. No apology, no refund... Only in Las Vegas???? Maybe, but definitely only at this theatre seeing a PG-13 movie with my child.  I'm not sure what kind of profiling you do at a theatre as a rent-a-cop, but the mom and kid minding their business eating your over priced food and drinking your over priced beverages paying for your overpriced movie that they reserved seating for in advance hours ahead of time watching in silence is not your best move.  HORRIBLE.\n\nAnd btw: our reclining chair was broken anyway."
0,"I came to Beauregard's for their mystery dinner theater on Saturday evening. I was surprised they offered something like this since the set-up was less than ideal. We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects, but it was tough to identify suspects because 1) many people were in costume, 2) they did introduce themselves but the mic was very quiet so it was extremely difficult to hear 3) There was very little room in between people and there was a big column blocking the main stage area.  \n\nUpon are arrival we had salads waiting for us. This was bagged iceberg shredded lettuce, a mealy tomato, and a cucumber. This was beyond uninspired but the dressing was tasty (though bottled most likely). Our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta. I thought the prime rib was better than expected. It was a tad on the small/thin side but it was cooked right (I asked for rare) and it was served with a nice baked potato and some au jus. I tried the pasta which wasn't amazing, but it certainly wasn't bad. The dessert was a pineapple orange pound cake which I found to be an odd choice. I was expecting it to be a signature dessert so I thought it might be good. It wasn't. It was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet. Why not serve chocolate cake, cookies, mousse? Those are choices more people are likely to enjoy. \n\nThe service was friendly -if a bit frantic. I felt bad for the servers since there wasn't a ton of room in the first place and now they had to work around people during the inquisition phase when people were walking around. I had to ask a couple times for some horseradish but in general I never wanted too long for anything. My drinks remained full..though the water had a bit of a funny pipe taste. \n\nThe show was bad. Costumes were super cheesy and the storyline very confusing. There were a ton of characters- maybe giving each table a list might help, or even name tags. Some actors were better than others but oddly enough their audience appointed actors did the stand-out job. There was very little actual show time and most of the time consisted of us having to go around and interview actors...or audience members. Which sounds more fun than it is because you wanted to enjoy your dinner. They took some cute pictures in the beginning and tried to get us to buy them for $20- but I wish they spent the money on a better production or layout. \n\nWe had fun since we came as a group, but overall half of us (and several others in the audience) left early, as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on. I would not pay full price, and I would not return."
1,Simply delicious! Its a small place with big flavors! If your craving a satisfying asian noodle soup than this is one of the best places in montreal for it!! Service is also quick !
1,"So I've been looking for a great smoothie spot in Downtown Pittsburgh and finally found this place!!! A great selection of smoothies and the best bunch of add-ins I've seen in the city! Great for when you need a boost of any kind, and more natural than the bulk of what you'll get at any other spot nearby. Plus: the one dood with glasses is as nice as could be:) Definitely stop by!"
0,"I guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in Las Vegas, you don't need to have a nice personality. The guys here are just plain dicks, one of them smelled of alcohol too."
1,"Bacchanal is the new king of buffet in vegas. The selection here is outstanding and authentic, and I can speak for the asian cuisines here. \n\nThe Best Food: BBQ pork, roast duck, tonkatsu ramen, freshly made mexican tacos, XLB\n\nSeafood: They have king crab on dinners and weekend brunch, and the price $45-50/pp does reflect that. The best way is to get in line at 1pm on a weekday and pay lunch price for the dinner at 3pm. The line is about an hour long so do time it correctly. \n\nMeats: Prime rib, brisket, bacon, chicken, sausage and lamb racks\n during dinner. I'm not a big meat fan so I thought most of the food was ok.\n\nOther food worth mentioning: a big salad bar, sides, cook your own pasta bar and sushi\n\nStay away from: little wagyu sliders, they were super dry. Most of their chinese stir fry was overly salty. \n\nIcing on top: Love their freshly squeezed juices, especially the watermelon and orange. And the crepes were amazing as well, you can pick your own toppings, I could eat 4 in one setting if it wasn't so bad for me. Other desserts were ok, the souffle was kind of a let down and didn't have the right consistency at all.\n\nBacchanal is much better than Wicked Spoon and the Wynn, but you will pay for more. It's worth the trip if you don't mind lines too much, be prepared to be blown away!"
1,"This place is definitely a favorite.  We've had really excellent experiences here (dinner and brunch)  - except for the most recent one.\n\nThe atmostphere is romantic - a cozy old house with cute little rooms, small tables with checked table cloth, soft lighting, the works.  They have fine food that's worth the price and it's a great date night experience.\n\nOn this last visit, our server was incredibly slow, beyond reasonable levels. She was nice enough, but we ended up running late for our next engagement, even though we arrived quite early.  She even took over five minutes processing our credit card after we said we were in a hurry, twice.  The restaurant was far from packed fairly early on a Thursday.  The people near us came in later and left earlier with the same number of courses (and a good server).  \n\nIn addition to being slow, she wasn't very helpful.  We ordered the crab cakes, which came with vegetables that were a little bland, and the stuffed pepper, which was so spicy that my husband and I both burned our mouths.  The server eventually came by and asked how we liked our food, and when we mentioned the screaming spice, she specifically said the dish wasn't meant to be at all spicy - then proceeded to do nothing about it.  Thank goodness another server who had a table nearby kept our waters full. \n\nOur shrimp cocktail appetizer had big, beautiful shrimp, and our creme brulee dessert was delicious.  The crab cakes themselves were great, and I could tell that the pepper dish would have been nice, if it hadn't been so incredibly spicy.  They clearly just forgot to clean out the seeds.\n\nLuckily, my husband and I were in good spirits and the poor service and food issues didn't put a damper on our night.  \n\nWe've been here many times and tried many menu items, including the crab cake sandwich, the meatloaf, the crab benedict at brunch, their mimosa and bloody mary, etc.  We've never had poor service or over-spicy food before, so I am leaving this review at 4 stars - it's an average of two for this visit and 5 for every other time we've visited."
0,"If I was allowed to give just one \""Worst of Yelp Awards\"" this would be it.\n\nThe Cards must have about 10,000 fans show up for games because the logistics for the National Championship game was a disaster.

1,"Definitely 5 star food and service. a little different than your \""typical\"" Mexican Restaurant But you should try it, awesome food and friendly people."
0,"Meh.\nMaybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. \nSo one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!\nIt was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich."
1,"I stayed here last summer with my parents and nephew, and my expectations were very low. So, I was pleasantly surprised. If you have been to real castles in Europe, Excaliber actually does a great job. It is a castle, not a mansion. It's old school stone castle feel. It was clean enough and my nephew loved it. Our view of McCarran airport and the mountains was actually pretty spectacular at sunset. I've stayed in dumps and I've stayed in the lap of luxury. I think my review is quite fair. Coffee shop food was better than Dennys, good enough that we visited several times for convenience. Even had fun secret gambling with Pops in there.\nAnd we LOVED the slide at the pool. Pool was also better than expected."
1,"We were going to a Cirque du Soleil show and came across BLT Burger. The service was a bit slow, but the burger and milkshake were great! I had a Tex Mex burger with a vanilla/Oreo milkshake. Highly recommend both! I would definitely go back!"
1,"Penn and Teller certainly get one thinking... and one of the topics is \""Did I really enjoy the show?\""  They are very personable, connect and mingle with the audience (playing the bass in the pre-show or when they turn up the house lights), and convey their continued passion for the craft.  When they supposedly explained how something was done, I anticipated that the point would be that they would then do something inexplicable.  Maybe I just didn't get it, but I don't think they added a confounding twist... maybe I miss that touch of slickness.  I want to be wowed in a magic show, and the fire eating, flag burning (obviously more flimsy than the one they had folded), nail gun, and newspaper tearing just didn't do it.  I guess Penn's tour de force rants make the show transcend your typical magic show; I loved catching a glimpse of his palmed ball of foil - you also glimpse his humanity.  I hope Teller isn't really mute... I think he was talking during the post-show photo-op... and does that camcorder bit mean we heard him speak!?  Penn's a great actor if that was scripted!  I guess I have to conclude that it was a worthwhile show for its blend of comedy, illusion, and commentary.  \nI wonder if they implanted a subliminal message about getting dessert afterwards (okay, he said it out loud).  Too bad we didn't look at our ticket stub because there was a coupon for free dessert attached!  The Rio is missing out on a huge money maker by not directing the departing crowd towards in-house choices."
1,"brought my bf here when he was in town because we don't have all you can eat sushi in houston.\n\nit's a small restaurant (right by my house!) and i would expect it to be packed during dinner time as it was busy during lunch. there is a time frame as to how long you can dine in on the all you can eat menu -45 minutes. it's $23 bucks per person.\n\nnow, keep in mind you can order HALF ORDERS on everything. we didn't know until later and made the mistake of ordering whole rolls and was stuffed by the time we finished our fifth. it makes it more worth it if you are able to try many different rolls because they're all really good!\n\ni personally love the nigiri menu, i had about eight pieces of the yellowtail- try it with ponzu sauce and jalape\u00f1os and you have yourself a mouthwatering dish! \n\ni loved their lychee sherbet dessert, it was delicious! \n\noverall, i highly recommend this place. though we did come out of the restaurant way too stuffed and on the edge of throwing up...at least we were satisfied."
0,"Were it possible to rate zero stars, I would have done that.\nI had the absolute worst experience at a restaurant/bar  of my life at Lustre.\nAfter sitting at our table, we waited 35 minutes and never received service at all. Bussers came by and assured us someone would be over. We went to the bar to get menus and they assured us someone would be over. After 25 minutes, we saw a manager and walked up and asked him if we could have someone come take our order and how long we'd been waiting. From him, more of the same empty promises.\nThe staff at Lustre couldn't care less about its patrons. Save yourself time and head to one of the many nearby establishments that actually exists for its customers.\nWe walked out."
1,Oh my gosh!  Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome.  Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked.
0,"Da Vang (pronounced yah yang) is a hole in the wall in a sketchy ass strip mall next to the latin strip club and the Vietnamese Boba Tea shop. Weeknights and Weekends alike, this place is packed to the gills with Asian families, Mexicans from the neighborhood, and the few rogue gays and hipsters who wander in to try something ironic or obscure. Then you have the old Mexican ladies who walk by every table and put a car air freshener on it with a note explaining that you can buy it from her for $1. There are countless flies, the place hasn't been cleaned since Jesus was alive, and the parking lot almost requires four wheel drive. There isn't a more third-world dining experience in Phoenix.\n\nMy initial inpression was that this would be a fantastic trip to a Vietnamese wonderland. Seeing the types of people eating here, the extensiveness of the menu, and the overall ruggedness of it probably meant it was legit. I'm not Vietnamese, Asian, or any shade of yellow, but I like to think I still know my food well enough to say that it was an absolute let down. I ordered one of the most basic dishes, Pho Tai which is a beef broth with rice noodles and sliced beef. It's typically served with jalapeno rings, bean sprouts, basil, and lemon wedges on the side, yet mine was minus the jalapenos and lemon. Each table of Asian people who ordered the same thing both before and after me, received the said items with their meal. After my plate of half the veggies I need arrived, they brought by our spring rolls. Again, total disappointment. The sauce which accompanied them tasted like pure Hoisin, and I much prefer the typical peanut sauce or even a fish sauce. My girlfriend's bowl of Bun looked like the noodles were garbage, and was extremely short on veggies and meat. \n\nOur server was nice enough, and rather typical of a restaurant of this type. They don't speak much, their way of asking if you'd like to order is saying \""are you done?\"" After a while though, I realized he was a Spanish speaker, and then I realized he was of hispanic heritage, nice. I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant. Made me want some enchiladas. Overall, this restaurant was a complete let down and if it hadn't been for the very low price (under $20 for two people) I'd have been very upset. I'll keep sticking with Little Saigon, Pho Thanh, Koai Hoan, and Dong A."
1,I love this place because of a few reasons. They have pretty good sushi for the boxed ones and they can make me rolls without avocado with no complaints because I'm allergic. The service is quick and friendly. It's a fast way to grab something to eat when you're on the go.
1,"Halloween was a clusterbitch and I just wanted something to nosh and to sit the hell down! With Firefly in the horizon, it seemed a better choice than fast food and diners in most the DT properties. \n\nBF and the Yelpizzles Elnino and Andy were my company. \n\nThe BF and I weren't too hungry so we shared\n\nBoquerones- one of my faves. I love white spanish sardines. \nVeggie Empanadas- comes with 2 and some salad. It was pretty good....I appreciate that the veggies werent processed down to a paste and were stuffed with slices of mushrooms and diced spinach. \nChorizo and Chicken Stuffed Mushrooms- meh. My BF said it reminds him of Hamburger Helper on a mushroom. After he said that, that's all I can get in my head. Won't order this one again. \nDessert Platter- comes with chocolate tres leches, passionfruit cheesecake, lemon tart, flan. All pretty decent. I liked the idea of the chocolate leches, I really like the passionfruit, tart was okay, flan was a surprise that it was good ( light, almost panna cotta like).\n\nGot a white sangria since I usually get red. It was alright....it's a bit tart which I like, but I dunno...I think the bolder red makes more sense with tart fruits. \n\nNow the service was spotty and wait for items was kinda long. I however wasn't going to dock them down for it only because our server was very apologetic and really tried to help her tables. I looked around and the place was filled and  there wasn't enough staff coverage for the volume. I always feel bad when that happens because it's not the servers fault if they get spread thin. Someone could have called in and screwed everyone or upper management/owners haven't hired enough people. Tapas is about sitting around and chatting so I wasn't in a hurry. Just keep that in mind though- come when you feel like having a long nosh since speed and service isn't a strong suit. \n\nI'm a \""fan\"" so I put it up to a 4 star since my visit was positive, but it's a round up since there are some obvious hangups."
1,"CLT is a convenient airport despite being a rather busy hub, with a fair amount of international traffic.  When I used to fly US Airways all the time, CLT would figure in my travel at least once a week.  Now, it's rare that I get to go through CLT.\n\nIt's a fairly new airport and the layout and amenities show that.  It has a wide open, airy feel to it in most concourses, especially the International concourse.  The central area where the B and C concourses meet can be a bit of a madhouse at times with people rushing between gates.  But there, in the midst of all this traffic, are dozens of cozy Adirondack style chairs where you can relax for a bit if you have the time between flights.\n\nThere is often some live entertainment in the central area... grand piano, country music, jazz - I've seen it all.  Lots of food options too - and a full fledged cigar/tobacco store - woohoo!!!\n\nWeather in the area is usually good which means minimal flight delays.  Delays are inevitable in a hub airport but when they do happen, CLT makes the experience a little less stressful by providing a lot of distractions in addition to the wonderful Southern charm of all the people working here.\n\nGreat place to connect if you're headed to the Caribbean - you're almost there already ;)\n\n~ 4 solid stars for a solid, dependable and charming \""little\"" big airport.  CLT may not be my favorite airport but it's one I'm quite fond of.\n\n# 280"
0,Average food at best. Wings undercooked and greasy. Onion rings underwhelming. Service poor. Waited 30 minutes when place wasn't busy...  Won't be back...
1,"This place looked very popular just from the amount of cars outside in the parking lot.  Inside however, they had plenty of room and sat us right away. \n\nThey have a decent selection of fried/broiled fish along with some other meat selections as well.  (I'm just not one to order a steak at a place thats known for it's fried fish)\n\nThe waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, we were quite pleased.\n\nAll of the food was pretty good, we had the broiled Alaskan Whitefish, Blackend Talipia, popcorn shrimp and the Mac and Cheese.  Everything overall was pretty good.\n\nThis is a great place to take the kids or a group to get your fried fish craving satisfied."
0,"Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok."
1,"Even though they have one at the Beverly Center in California, I've eaten here the last two times i've been to Vegas. I think if you're looking for a nice, decent, comfortable, affordable place to eat after you've spent a good amount of money gambling, this is the place. The portions are huge and we all couldnt finish all our food! I had the salmon thats prepared three different ways and I LOVED IT! We also ordered the beignets(sp?) for dessert and it was waay better than the ones at Disneyland. I highly recommend this place if you dont feel like eating at any of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. The only thing is that our server messed up on our bill by charging us twice for gratuity or something (my friend figured it out, I wasnt paying attention) and he barely came back to check on us or refill our drinks. We also ate here on a Sunday night around 10 so it wasnt too busy."
1,"Upscale. Expensive. But the food and service are beyond compare. The restaurant is merely a block from the Belk theater, so it's great for dinner beforehand or drinks afterwards. Look at their website to really get a look into this restaurant & how they serve their proteins, individually off of \""spits\"". Filet mignonette, ribeye, pork, scallops, shrimp, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken etc."
1,"TEXT MESSAGING\nMe:  \""Wanna go First Friday at Beauty Bar?\""\nCousins:  \""I'm down, what time?\""\nMe:  \""Let's meet at my house by 10:30pm\""\nCousins:  \""Okay... what do I wear?\""\nMe:  \""It's all casual and chill.  Just come as you are\"".\n\nEver wanted to go somewhere where you don't have to worry about looking cute or packing on the foundation and blow-drying your hair?  Sometimes it gets annoying getting ready for over an hour, smelling good only to come out the total opposite.  Not Beauty Bar... no, no, no.  I love the fact that I can wear jeans, a baby-t, pull my hair in piggy-tails with a puma hat over it, tennis shoes, eye-liner and lip gloss, and I'm all set to party and chill.  \n\nWhen my cousins and I arrived, there was already a line where people were waiting to be let in.  Luckily, the line wasn't unbearable and only waited for about a good 10 minutes before entering.  I knew the bouncer since I found this place through my old work promoting and marketing Kool cigarettes, and he was always friendly with us.  I was about to just walk right in since that's what I was used to, but I was abruptly stopped by the cashier.  \""Five dollars, please.\""  Damn!  First time I've had to pay to get in.  At least it's only a $5 and not $20 or more.  Can't complain.  Maybe if I wore a skirt and she was a lesbian, she would've let me in after a cute smile at her.  For guys, it's $10.  So be ready to have cash at hand.  Otherwise,  you'll have to go to the ATM and it's a waste of a walk just for small bills.\n\nIt was a crowded scene, people with drinks in their hand and/or waiting to get a drink at the bar.  At times, there are people who do art off to the side and a lady who will give you a manicure.  Never seen anything like it.  I liked the originality of it.  Mostly, it's like a lounge without any seats on the inside.  After walking deeper inside the club, there you're lead to a small dance floor and the music is like techno/dance.  That's where the bathrooms are too.  I'd hate to dance where I can smell people's shit and puke.\n\nFurther down, you'll hit the door that leads to the outside.  This is where all the b-boys and b-girls are doing their thing. The music is underground hip-hop.  Don't come here if you want 50Cent or Justin Timberlake.  Commercial HipHop is not welcome.  If it's a good crowd, it's a great night.  But this night, my cousins and I were bored.  There wasn't much happening and all the seats were pretty much taken.  So, we were just standing around.  I needed to get sloshed if it was gonna be like this the whole night.  Drinks are $5 a glass of anything.  I loved that!  Since I was a light weight, I got tipsy with $15.    Woohoo, what a cheap drunk I was.  We finally got a couch to sit on so we raced for it.  I was starting to have fun until I felt like I had to entertain someone the whole night.  That was my exit.  We stayed a good 2 hours and left.  \n\nI love First Friday.  I'd go back just so I can try to dance if there were anyone else dancing.  I guess I'd be like a karaoke dancer - I'd have to be wasted to feel comfortable on the dance floor."
1,"LVAC on Flamingo .aka. the \""Pretty Gym\"". \n\nMost of the people that work out at this gym are already in shape, I feel so out of place, just like one of the other Yelpers. You have the guys that look like steroid users and then the girls that look like they work at Deja Vu, I don't mean to stereotype but how else are you going to get the picture? I personally don't care, yea, they look good and I need a LOT of work, but seriously, we're all there for the same reason, it's just going to take more time for myself lol oh well! \n\nThe gym and locker rooms are well maintained, the machines don't smell like butt and most times, if a machine needs attention, the people that work out here are pretty good about letting management know. My only gripe is that they need to MOVE THE FOOD STAND ELSE WHERE. Right when you walk in, you smell food, and it smells pretty good. I'm coming here to work off the crap I just ate and now they're tempting me with more crap to eat! Boo! \n\nThere are a variety of amenities that you're able to take advantage of, of course, certain thing may cost a little more but prices are still pretty good compared to other gyms. They have racket ball courts, indoor track, women's workout room, steam room, indoor pool, spin classes, zumba classes, really, a lot of classes. Their classes are pretty cool, you're able to join in any of the classes no matter what level you are, you don't have to wait for an 'advanced' or 'beginners' class, you go in and you go at your own pace. \n\nAnother amenity that's available for parents of young children is that they have a play room where they can watch your kids. I've seen infants in there and I think that the oldest age that you can take there is 12. Monitors are inside the gym, so you're able to check in on them without having to walk all the way over there. \n\nAfter the gym, I like the fact that there's a Tropical Smoothie right across the street and they offer a 10% discount to LVAC members. \n\nI like this gym, just move the food some where else, PLEASE."
1,"The first time i had Burrito Boyz, I was at a meeting where the food was catered. I had no idea where my mystery burrito fell from. \n\nMy first impression? It was the best burrito I've ever had. Brain: \""Wow there like avocado in here too\"". What else can i say? They put everything you could possible want (and things you didn't know you wanted) in your burrito. \n\nI've been to the Toronto location a few times the food tastes the same. The quality, service, and price at this location however is not up to par.\n\nBut whatever, you came for the burrito."
1,Fantastic! Clean facility and always busy (a good sign- but make a reservation!) The polishes aren't old and crusty and they always have new colors.
1,"This might surprise you, but this place doesn't have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!\n\nSometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).\n\nWhen I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto."

0,"My son and I went in tonight for dinner. Worst service ever. The first two girls pushed us along, my son was trying to ask her a question she just blew him off. He is eight years old. Not like he is a toddler running amuck. He order a kids # 4 which is a build your own tacos. We under stand that it only came with two sides. When he asked if he could have some lettuce she told him NO. That it would be an extra charge for for that. Are you kidding me for lettuce on a kids taco. I couldn't believe it. Especially after I just paid 2.00 for a skimpy side of guacamole for his taco. something restaurants should make a point of to their employees is that customers only go out maybe once a month or twice now, not like 5 years ago when it was 3 times so when it comes to making a choice where to go before they leave the house they think hmm..well last time I went there this or that happened, something as simple as they didn't even say goodbye or thank us as we were leaving and we tipped. Just some lettuce for thought chipotle."
1,"In my quest to check out all Japanese markets in the greater Las Vegas area, I just happen to see this on my nearby search feature on my phone.\n\nLocated in a nice plaza off of Eastern Avenue, this place is just to the right of Monta. I love these quaint little markets because they give you that cozy feeling. Probably because these places are mom and pop owned. Plus supporting your local business is always a good thing.\n\nAs I went in, I am greeted in Japanese by what I assume was one of the owners in the form of a nice old lady. The first thing I looked for was any Kit Kat flavors I havnt tried yet. All they had were the dark chocolate ones. I asked the lady when they get new flavors and all she could tell me was that they are mostly seasonal. \n\nAs I walked around, I noticed a lot of common Japanese staples you would find at other places. For this place I noticed they had all sorts of different kinds of sushi in the refrigerated section. This was something I havnt seen at other Japanese markets or maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.\n\nSo in my ever growing discovery of Japanese markets, this place is very similar to all the others that I have encountered and will stop by any time I am in the area.\n\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #11"
1,"This Oregano's location is like the Anti-Oregano's of the Phoenix area.  It is very spacious, there's a lot of available parking, and when I was here there wasn't a long wait for seating.  The food is like any other Oregano's location: Tasty with large portions.  I'm still a bit dubious of the notion of \""Chicago thin-crust pizza,\"" when I'm so used to Chicago deep dish, and also the fact that the pizza looks like a St. Louis style Imo's Pizza with different cheese.  But, no matter what you get, rest assured you won't leave starving!  \n\nI've had pizzas, pizookies, various appetizers, and sandwiches here, and for the most part I've been pretty satisfied with the food.  My latest order was the veggie sandwich, which came with large slices of marinated portabella mushroom, cheese, tomatoes, basil, and lettuce.  Even though I ordered the junior size, it was still a hefty portion and I could only finish half of it!  The sweet potato fries were interesting in that they were dusted with cinnamon, adding a sweet dessert-like element to them.\n\nOur server was great and provided refills as needed.  I would say out of all the locations, this one is probably the best one!"
0,"Stopped in to this joint for lunch one day and ordered brisket.  They had pulled it for sandwiches, instead of slicing it.  Was stringy and tough.  May try again later, may not. \n\nMy quest for good brisket in the valley continues.  So far Famous Dave's is my top choice."
1,"After the demise of the Argentinian sandwich shop here, I wondered what business would take the place in this location.  I was naturally intrigued when I found out that there would be a smoothie and acai bowl place opening up in its stead. I think this is a great location for acai bowls, since Sprouts is just a few steps away, bringing in the more health-conscious crowd.  I went in with high hopes of getting a healthy, fruitful bowl.\n\nThere are quite a few bowls to choose from, some of them fruity, others more dessert-like, with peanut butter and chocolate.  I opted for a fruitier bowl, getting the tropical.  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and it was quite tasty.  The bottom layer was a smooth, thick acai puree/sorbet-like mixture, which tasted berry-like.  There was crunchy, sweet granola layered in between the acai and the tropical fruit (Banana, mango, and pineapple), with large, thin shaved pieces of coconut completing the bowl. The granola itself was a high quality mixture, containing ingredients such as flax seed. The bowl was a nice mixture of textures and of tastes.  I ordered a small (About $5), and it definitely filled me up!\n\nService was very friendly, and they offer a points reward system which uses your e-mail to keep track of your purchases.  The interior is pretty bare-bones, and it seems like they kept much of the same color scheme as the previous owner.\n\nDefinitely a good place to go if you're looking for a healthier alternative to dessert, or if you want a lighter (Yet filling) meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"
0,"Ordered the Bun Thit Nuong, a lot of the pieces of meat were either all fat or mostly fat. Some fat is ok, but majority fat is not good in my book. their fish sauce was too sweet for my liking. On to the next vietnamese/pho restaurant!"
0,This cafe is located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino by the west tower. I was staying at the Cosmo for a conference so I needed some breakfast. Their selection was very limited. I got an almost croissant and it was waaay too sweet. It was more like eating dessert. I also needed a bottle of water. It was like 5 bucks for a bottle of Smart Water. If it was Fiji water I wouldn't mind as much. I got 2 bottles of water and 2 croissants for $20. So expensive and I didn't even finish the croissant. \n\nI didn't go back here. I found out McDonalds  was close by at Planet Hollywood so I ended up going there for breakfast the next few days. And there's also a Walgreens close by so you can probably buy a pack of water bottles for 5-6 bucks. \n\nWould NOT recommend.
1,"I went there for my wife bday dinner, with a group of 12. I was a bit worried after reading the negative reviews. I am happy to say that I had a great experience..\n\nIts supposed to be classy italian place and may get busy at nite with the byob..All depends on your luck. I was there on a saturday nite and the place was packed with decent crowd. \n\nKeep in mind its an Italian place so be smart and order something italian.\nMenu wise they have a great choice of  pasta and steak options...I took the Italian sausage pasta and it turns out to be one of the best.  The week before i was a t L'Academie  with the same group. so it was easy to compare. And group found their food is better than L'Academie. \n \nWe had one main waiter and 2 others helping him and they were always around for help. Food showed up in 20-30 mins and I will definitely recommend to everyone...\n\nI choose this place because i have been to other Italian places in west with the same group So decided to give a try. \n\nWill definitely go back and recommend to others based on my experience.\n\nPT"
1,"As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit."
1,"Update with a review on their cake-making skills.  I ordered a cake for my gender reveal party.  It turned out beautifully, tasted amazing, and they were very familiar with the concept of a gender reveal cake.  They were even willing to have it baked and ready for pickup at my requested date - which happened to be over the holidays when the regular restaurant was closed.  The bakers came in special to bake my cake (and a couple other people's cakes too) so I could pick it up on the day of the big reveal."
1,"I like Karen's Kreamery.  I made it a place to go when it was located in Surprise for the Gelato.  Inexpensive for great ice cream.  Great that they took up shop at the skate park, I assume they get more business at the new location. Guess I'm going to have to learn to skateboard to have an excuse to visit the park for ice cream.:)"
0,Horrible door men and promoters. Waited in line 20 mins after being comped. Got to the door and told couldn't get in without a ticket. Bullsh*t. Do not go here.
0,"There is no way I would go back to this place, especially to protect my health.\n\nWho is rating this a 4 or 5 star restaurant?  Is the Vietnamese food in Charlotte that terrible?  This is the only Vietnamese Restaurant I have been to so far in Charlotte, but it was absolutely awful.  I don't live in this city, but I felt obligated as a good citizen to warn others about this extremely disappointing place.\n\nIf you have any concern about the quality of food you eat, I would strongly recommend you avoid this restaurant at all costs.  I have been to Vietnamese restaurants all around the world (including Vietnam), and this is definitely on the bottom of the scale to me.\n\nWhen I walked into the restaurant my first impression was a very unappetizing rotten noxious smell filling the entire room.  Against my better judgment, I still stayed to try a few dishes, as I am  a food adventurer, and I falsely trusted some previous yelp reviews which were obviously very misleading to me.  Still, I take responsibility that I made a big mistake to stay at this restaurant.\n\nThe environment was reasonable beyond the horrific smell, but the service was quite forgetful and not competent.  Communication in English was not easy, and I was not brought some of the things I ordered, like a glass of water I asked for twice... We are talking basics they can not perform here.  Some of the staff was more worried about eating their own meal in the same room when I dined there.  \n\nHowever, the worst part of the meal were the Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Chicken.  At first, the Chicken looked like nice strips of white chicken breast meat, but either it was spoiled, poorly prepared inconsistent with health department guidelines, or it was the cheapest and worst quality chicken on the market as it had such a terrible rotten and spoiled taste.  After a few bites, I was absolutely disgusted, and decided to stop eating, pay the check, and leave the restaurant.\n\nI did not feel well the rest of the day and evening.... and I could hardly eat anything else until the next day.  Not a good experience I would recommend for others.\n\nI think the people running the restaurant were nice people, but they really need to learn how to delivery quality service, how to invest in and prepare quality food, and most of all figure out a way to keep the restaurant from smelling like a sewer when customers walk in...  at least that is what it smelled like to me when I came there...\n\nI love Vietnamese food, and would love to see more quality Vietnamese food served in Charlotte and all over the country, but not at this poor quality level.  It is a not a good representation of Vietnamese Cuisine...."
1,Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night.
0,"First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom."
1,"This has got to be, hands down, THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN TOWN!!!!!\n\nSeriously!\n\nI love breakfast. Who doesn't?  I ordered Joes Favorite (#2)\n\nThe pancakes are deliciously perfect. They are crisp, slightly salty (perhaps from buttermilk?), with a nice dollop of butter on top. \n\nThe bacon is perfection on a plate. Perfectly crisp, thick cut, great flavor. \n\nThe sausage is flavorful and nicely seared on each side. \n\nThe scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked, not dry, not runny...just perfect. \n\nThe first time we went we ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes and a biscuit just to try. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned, and even had a hint of rosemary. \n\nThe biscuit was good, the jams that came out were yummy, strawberry and possibly black or boysenberry?\n\nThe second time we ordered the breakfast potatoes and french fries. \nThe french fries are perfectly seasoned and crisp. The breakfast potatoes were missing the rosemary this time around. \n\nThe coffee is as good as everyone says it is. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try, I guarantee you will crave those pancakes!!!"
1,"+10 on everything Misti Y said in her review, and I wanted to add that I also ate the Baked Maine Lobster \""Dynamite\"" with Spicy Dungeness Crab Stuffing on Valentine's night. INCREDIBLE! The real crab stuffing was the ultimate 'spicy crab' that all versions of 911 rolls aspire to be. Needless to say, I was stuffed myself by the end of the meal. \n\nWe were told that it took 2 months of recipe development to come up with their McDonald's Apple Pie tribute. It was so compellingly crafted and conjured such vivid taste memories that I laughed out loud after the first bite."
0,Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
0,"Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.  \n\nI always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark."
1,"It's a pool supply store.   I usually don't go to these places, but I was trying to get a solar blanket for my pool....I had all the blue prints, but still not enough info!  Really!   Dammmm it, I have to go back again!"
0,"I recently rented a tent at First Friday to showcase my paintings. The people running it are very nice and helpful.. But the crowds are terrible! People threw their trash right in front of my largest paining 3 times! Everyone wanted to take pictures but no body was willing to buy. I think first friday was awesome, but as time goes by it seems to be less about the art and more about becoming a swap meet. And it used to be a family event but now you cant walk 5 feet without smelling weed. I wish everyone there the best of luck but I will not be attending anymore."
0,"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne."
0,"The best thing about this \""bar\"" was the band and the chick bartenders that were nice and made a great cosmo. The worst thing was the actual bar itself. It's so small, and there's not much seating. I guess it's a cool idea. Upstairs, dark, small. Lol, but I thought the bouncer or whatever he was-door guy seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe cuz he was stuck outside on the stairs all night. The people there were mostly rude. We did manage to kind of create a dance floor where there wasn't one and then it got fun. But again, not a lot of room to dance. We went on a Sunday night. So perhaps a Friday or Saturday would have a different vibe and crowd. Overall kind of fun for a casual drink or maybe a good place to have a couple drinks before you go out somewhere else. ; )"
0,"Was there on a Friday around 7 pm.  The wait staff ignored people standing to get a table; but the collective annoyance of those waiting must have been heard as the manager walked over and asked if we were waiting for a table....genius! \n\nWe got a table and ordered stuffed dates and something else so bland I can't remember what it was.  \n\nAs we were talking, the entertainment for the evening were two guys singing and playing a guitar. They were so loud and not-very-good that people were yelling across the table to hear one another; at that point we were ready to leave and noticed so were many other people.\n\nPros: Great decor and atmosphere, variety of tables/seating, comfortable chairs.\n\nCons: Unfriendly staff, loud, bad music."
0,"As many previous Yelpers mentioned Hard Rock Hotel (HRH) didn't live up to my expectations either.\n\n- lopsided bed, $15 hidden resort fee, no free wifi, smokey in hallways (should separate nonsmoking area from smoking), Starbucks cost 2x as much, Mr. Lucky's restaurant promotions don't work on holidays even though they promoted it that way, dimly lit bathrooms, poor electrical wiring (light switches didn't always turn on lights and some turned off all), fan blew directly towards bed and not able to be changed direction, insulation not well because we could hear our loud neighbors, direction of check-in is terrible (didn't realize there were several towers with different check-ins and parking garages).\n\n+ TV wasn't blasting loudly when you first turn it on, comforters were extremely comfortable, rock and roll decoration and photos.\n\nTargeted towards a specific crowd, tattooed, 20s & 30s. Across the street, you can get really good German food! It's actually not that close to the Strip as you think it is. It's at least 2 miles. (I measured it when I drove). So it would be not recommended to walk, unless you don't mind the distance and have time to spare.\n\nI will not stay here again nor recommend it."
0,"I don't expect a fancy parade of amazing service, offerings of exotic produce or a team of personal shoppers fawning over me when I go to the grocery store. Given that grocery shopping is already the bane of my life, I have really low expectations for the place where I purchase my impressive assortment of top ramen food products.\n\nSeriously, I'm not shopping for organic baby prawn medleys and goose liver patte'... I just want to get in and purchase my run of the mill poor person foods like canned beans and frozen dinners. So when I say low expectations, I mean REALLY low expectations.\n\nSo it really says something about the Smith's that I would rather saw off my own foot than shop for my failure cuisine at their grocery store. \n\nWhen someone that has been beaten by the poverty police and kicked in the face by life as much as I have doesn't want to shop at your store no matter how great your prices are, you have got some problems. I don't actually notice that the prices are much different than any other store in the area, though. \n\nTo be fair, I may not be noticing prices because of the instant seizure caused by walking into the herd of people always grazing around in the Smith's. The prices seem to be the same overinflated prices seen everywhere else in Las Vegas. Same high prices, same fake discounts.\n\nThe parking lot at the Smith's is absolutely insufferable. It's like parking at Walmart, but without the option to park really far away in hopes that your car won't be needlessly assaulted. You can always count on Smith's to give you that uneasy sensation you get when leaving your car in a suspicious lot. Any sense of relief you feel when finding your car unscathed at the end of the shopping trip will quickly subside when you try to leave and a number of cars pass behind you, almost collide with you, get in your way and speed. \n\nDespite the anger and road rage you will feel in the Smith's parking lot, I think you can really count yourself lucky that none of these citizens of our fair city ran you over as a pedestrian.\n\nWhen you get inside the store you might actually just have a panic attack and die. I always hope that is what will happen to me when I see that battlefield. To say that Smith's has an overcrowding problem is a laughable understatement. Smith's makes every day feel like Black Friday: You will bump into other people, wait in line to look at things and have trouble navigating the store through all that human garbage. I guess that is not too bad when you think about the hand-to-hand combat that could ensue should Smith's ever hold true to the Black Friday tradition and place an item on sale. (They are keeping us safe.) \n\nBring your hand  sanitizer for all the awesome contact with humanity you'll be having at the Smith's!\n\nI think the owner must be friends with the fire marshall because there is no way that place isn't over capacity at any given time. If it weren't for all the food in there I'd say it was like a third world country. Except, I guess third world countries do have food but no one can afford it. So it is pretty similar to a third world country. Without the charm.\n\nI guess it is not fair to hold the business responsible for the fact that so many people descend on the store like the apocalypse is upon us. However, I can and do blame them for not staffing the store properly and relying almost exclusively on self-checkout. This causes all those people to become trapped in the store and creates a feeling desperation and taints the air with the smell of sweat. It also fills my heart with hate.\n\nThere is always a huge line of frustrated people clogging up the isle in the front of the store. There is only one isle with a person checking and it's always crammed, so people start to self-checkout with way too many items or when they are way too stupid to operate the sophisticated check out equipment. I hope the person who thought of self-checkout was put to death for his crime against humanity.\n\nOnce you are able to get to the front of the line, expect to get held up at least once because even of you are not purchasing alcohol the bagging area is very weight sensitive. In fact, Smith's is so concerned that you are going to steal from them that they force you to wait for an attendant because you dropped a ten cent packet of Koolaide. Then you have to wait for an eternity because Smith's has left the same person in charge of 8-10 stations and there are clearly a ton of people who should not be using self checkout to begin with.\n\nLook, I'm not classy, I don't have any pride, I'm shopping at Smith's for crying out loud! Grocery shopping is a horrible chore and I hate it with a passion. Unfortunately Smith's makes a chore feel like a war. I shouldn't have to take a nap afterwards."
1,"I love going to this place. I usually go with my sister to catch up with great conversation and great, healthy food. I had thought in the past that it was a fast greek chain like pita pit, but it's actually a sit down restaurant. We ALWAYS start with the Fruit & Cheese Fantasia. It is SO good, and it's gigantic. The fruit and the cheese are such good quality its hard to stop eating. I would order the mediterranean chicken pita, sometimes we would be so full from the fruit and cheese we would share one or take home half. The service is good, they are polite and timely with your order. I would recommend pita jungle."
0,"Ordered the cheese ravioli to be delivered to work. It arrived fast, but as I ate I could not chew some parts. When I spit them out, I discovered shredded plastic- I'm thinking it was a bag of some sorts. Replacing it was not an option and I doubt I want to call again to use my \""credit\"". Not sure how much I ate..."
1,I walked into Stitched and into heaven.  The clothes are amazing and Jack was friendly and very helpful.  I'm going back tomorrow to check more clothes out.  Jack is the bomb!  Very soon I will have a new wardrobe of fabulousness!  Highly recommended for the individually fashion minded.
0,"After suffering the mediocrity of Agave, the terse life of Dos Caminos, and the overly authentic Toros, I was super excited to dine here.\n\nUnfortunately I won't get the chance Due to a 'private event' booking the whole restaurant on a Tuesday after work. Nothing like spending millions on renovations and not letting locals access it. \n\nThanks Mercadito, we're off to a great start."
0,"This place doesn't even deserve one star!  It is absolutely disgusting!  Myself and my guest both got food poisoning from this place!  We went there on April 25, 2013.  Our sickness lasted for days!  Everything on the buffet was old, dried out and room temperature.  And omg....the bathrooms....wow!!!!  Absolutely disgusting!  The entire place was filthy.  I knew we should have walked out immediately!  Just from the smell inside the place.  Whatever you do.....remember....you are taking a very very big chance if you eat here!  I think it would be more likely than not....that you will end up sick!  We actually got staph food poisoning from here.  Otherwise known as \""Staphylococcus aureus bacterium\"".  I truly believe this place needs to be SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY!!!"
0,"Absolute worst dining experience of my life. When we walked in there was only one clean table, not empty mind you, just clean. The wait for our food was astronomical. When food finally came out it was cold and the sandwiches were wrong! Who puts mayo on pastrami anyhow?? Wait staff was to busy talking on their phones to pay attention to customers. As I sit here writing this I am STILL waiting on the check and we have been done eating for a good 20 minutes. Save yourself the hassle! Don't go!"
0,"The restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group. The salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful. We had a variety of food: tacos, enchiladas and carne asada. Unfortunately the food was bland and not very good. Perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day."
0,"ESPN Zone has cool concept. Eat while watching your favorite sports teams. We came here last week to watch the Warriors game. My cousin's 4 year old son Loves the warriors. He can sit through a whole game and knows most of the players. I think its pretty amazing. So after leaving him in this kids place most of the day we thought he would enjoy ESPN Zone for dinner. \n\nThe food was actually not bad. But nothing spectacular. I usually list everything off but I'm not going to b/c that's all you really need to know. It's bar food. \n\nThe service actually is not good. The waiter even gave my mother attitude when she asked him about a drink. He might not have heard her b/c the place is loud but attitude was not necessary. \n\nThe TV at the table was pretty cool. They have all these different feeds and you can chose what you want to watch. We were however having some volume issues. All we could hear was the booth's next to us feed. And yes, I did try to raise the volume using the touch pad tv screen. It wasn't working."
0,"Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \n\nNo happy hour menu. \n\n\""Communal bar table\"" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\n\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return."
1,"***This review based on happy hour only.\n\nI'm excited about this place.  While I was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials (how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour??), by the time I left, I was still a fan.  My optimistic potential viewpoint is based on these 2 unique factors:\n\n1) amazing rooftop bar.  Seriously.  We were up there at about 8:30pm on a 102-degree day, and it was honestly comfortable!  I had been skeptical that we'd be able to make it, but between the misters and canvas \""retractable ceiling tiles,\"" it was a pleasant way to view an amazing sunset over Camelback and Squaw Peak.  This view is fantastic and I am glad that Del Frisco's is taking full advantage of it.  This rooftop is simply cool, and made me feel like I was in a real, proper city!\n2) complimentary valet.  But even better than just the complimentary valet right in front of the restaurant, the valet also has an option where you can text them 10 minutes before you're ready to go, and your car will be pulled up when you walk out.  This makes this place a very convenient place to meet up without having to deal with parking!\n\nThe cocktails and wine list were pretty standard, and we had a flatbread pizza that was really yummy.  But it was the rooftop bar and valet that will make me come back -- and next time, stay for dinner."
1,"This is the first place I ate at when I came to Vegas. I ordered the Diagon Ally drink and omg it's amazing!!!!! I also had the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp also good. My boyfriend ordered the Henry burger and he loved his. Our waiter was awesome, the host could've used some customer service skills but overall it was great! And we will be back!"
1,"You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain, but this Costco has to be one of the better organized and there are an abundant amount of workers to help you out.  Be prepared to spend at least $100.  You think you only need a few things, but you keep adding up more.  On this particular occasion for whatever reason, I spent more than $400.  I was definitely packing it in for the winter hibernation.  Lastly, they have their food court indoors, which is essential considering your food or icre cream would wither away in the 110 degree heat."
1,"Spectacular food and service. We started with the blue shrimp salad which was prepared with an orange sauce - out of this world! My wife had the veal and I had the ahi tuna, both were marvelously presented and tasted phenomenal. Eat bite was savored. We pair our meals with the four vine Chardonnay (meat), and the Pinot noir (fish). Great choices. For dessert we had the apple crumble prepared in a bourbon sauce. That was the only part of the meal we would only give four stars. Everything else was five star.\n\nThe one drawback was the overwhelming noisy atmosphere. Might be their design intention though. We would recommend!"
0,"I am not one to totally trash a business, because I understand that once in a while even the best run business can have a off night, but I can honestly say this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, and I have no problem at all posting my review. \n\nWe went there for the \""All you can eat fish Fry\"" only because we saw an ad and had coupons. While it was a buffet, it was not \""all you can eat\"" as the food was not replenished enough. The food was cold, and they didn't have your typical \""fish fry\"" dishes like cole slaw, french fries, mac and cheese. Instead there was a horrendous selection of lasagna, some sort of stuffed pork dish, stuffing, gravy and some sort of pudding item for dessert. \n\nOn top of all that, the staff was rude. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the cashier, who when she finally cashed us out didn't ask us how the food was, or engage in any sort of pleasantries. \n\nStay away from this join, far away."
1,"We went here on the recommendation of the two other reviews on Yelp, and were pleased. The place is very small, but perfectly decorated. The staff are friendly and communicative. \n\nMy friends all loved what they had, but I wasn't so keen on the baked cod; it was rather flavorless. One friend had the figs for a starter and she loved them. Another had lasagna, and said that it was the best lasagna she's ever had in her life. \n\nI'd say that this place is worth the trip. Plus, they got very high ratings on another website that it used a lot in the UK."
0,Absurd wait time. We waited in a line of ~15 people for 45 minutes. I timed the group in front of us (5 orders). It took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin' ice cream. No business this inefficient should be around. But obviously the ice cream is good.
0,"One star for food and one for their awesome bartender Emmanuel who redeemed the offensive service I got here. I've came here twice and both times Emmanuel was working the bar-so friendly and personable! He's just an all around nice guy, likes to make sure everyone's having a good time. If I could've taken the tip back from our waiter and given it to him, I would've. He gave us more service in the 8 minutes we were at the bar than our \""waiter\"" did in the 45 minutes we were at our table. \n\nI get it, not everyone likes their job every day. I don't like my job every single day! But when dealing with customers you pretend to like your job and don't make them feel like their presence is a burden. Our waiter didn't get that memo and his inattentiveness bordered on neglect. He came to our table three times, once to take our drink orders, food orders and then to bring the check. The way he asked if we wanted the check basically said \""I want you to leave now.\"" The busser came by more often than he did to see if we needed anything. \n\nThis place isn't worth the time if you're coming from out of your way. If you choose to go for the simple fact that yard house is the cluster that it usually is, sit at the bar!"
0,"On Thursday 3/28 I received a flyer from Rosatis at work.  Since we have ordered Rosatis pizza in the past and really liked their product we thought it was nice that they had a location so much closer to us now. \n\nHere's why they get 1 star.\n\nWe ordered an XL thin crust pizza for delivery and were told it would arrive in an hour and the total was $25.  No problem, that's normal for Rosatis, and quality food takes time.  \n\nThe delivery guy arrived on time (right at an hour) and was acting kinda weird.  He seemed nervous and set the pizza on the desk.  We signed for it and said thanks.  He just kinda stood there and looked at all of us (there were three in the room).  I asked if there was anything else?  He said \""no\"" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.\n\nWe took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.\n\nI called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this \n\n\""um... sorry.\""  So I said \""ok...\"" To which she replied \""are there any other major complaints?\""  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.\n\nThe manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.\n\nSo we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.  Thanks for the $2.  I don't think I'll be cashing in on your offer."
1,"I love this place! The bagels seem to always be fresh out of the oven and I might just be lucky but I usually get them while still warm. \n\nThe staff seem to be just what one would want in a 24hr bagel place, quick and efficient while still being polite.\n\nThere really isn't much to say about the decor other then it's a bagel place which sells ready to eat Indian food?!? Like the previous reviewer say \""an odd combo\"" but they seem to make it work. I must admit that I haven't had their Indian food for a few months but last time i was there it was some of the best store bought Indian I've had.\n\nIf you live in and around N.D.G. this a great place to grab a quick dinner after work and a dozen bagels for the next morning, you can't go wrong."
1,"I never knew this place existed until a friend told me about it! It's located in the Bellagio right next to the themed gardens, really close to the parking garage so it's a short walk away.\n\nJust looking at the bakery made my jaw drop in awe! The chocolate fountain was so crazy looking, and the chocolate itself looked silky and smooth flowing down. All the decorative cakes on display were PERFECT and expensive looking. I was amazed!\n\nThis place gets PACKED and there are so many options for you to choose from I didn't know where to begin.. even though I was yelping through my blackberry, too many items were listed! I ended up choosing a ham and cheese croissant (gotta love em) and an almond brioche, as well as a strawberry rice krispy ball my friend recommended.\nThe H&C was delish! Buttery croissant with baked cheese on the outside, and white cheese and ham on the inside. Quite good!\nThe almond brioche was just okay, again, very buttery.\nStrawberry rice krispy was yummy, the strawberry flavor didn't taste artificial at all!\nSide note: the individual bags the pastries were in soaked through completely.. which means.. extreme oil!\n\nI don't know what I was thinking, but I didn't order a crepe or purchase any of their chocolates :\\ the line for a crepe alone looked long.. but they smelled so good! Next time I'm here, totally going for a crepe even if it's a 30 min wait. I also loved the boxes and bags they packaged everything in.. so cute and chic!"
0,"We actually ate here twice, lunch on Sunday and Breakfast on Monday.  Food was ok.  What loses a star is the cost.  It is overpriced for what you get -- I  guess I was thinking that being Vegas it would be more reasonable.  Granted, I was thinking Denny's prices.  The salad was good, but very basic - a lot of lettuce, chicken, lettuce ... you get the picture..  The breakfast was good.   Our server had brought out the preservatives that I wanted (Raspberry) instead of telling me that it wasn't available - so yeah for that!"
1,"If my neighbors, Joe and Craig (like you care what their names are) hadn't discussed this place in my presence, I wouldn't be here today.\nI ordered the huevos rancheros, and my husband ordered the steak and eggs.\nHe loved his breakfast so much that he barely spoke. \nI loved my breakfast. And I mean, loved it. \nOut of a sense of duty, i offered the hubby a bite, and luckily, he was too busy devouring his steak and eggs, thus declining..\nMy huevos rancheros had perfectly cooked (over well) eggs on top of corn tortillas. On top? A delicious pork green chili that was to-die-for delish. In addition, you get rice and beans, AND hash browns! \nYummy, yummy, yummy! \nThe place is darling, very comfortable and has very nice personnel that are will to please. \nWe've already been back, and it was just as good the second time as it was the first!\nThis place is a winner!!!"
0,Food was ok and service was really bad.\n\nWe went there for the Christmas Eve dinner. We made the reservation at 11pm via OpenTable which shows that they have reservation available at 11 or 11:30. However after we arrived the waitress said they will close at 12. We decided to just eat very fast which turned out to be a really bad idea because during the dinner the wait staff were really impatient and rude.\n\nMost of the food were also not as good as the other yelp reviewers said...although I am not sure if it was because it was the Christmas Eve.
0,"Oh Johnny, what have you done?\n\nIf I were to have written this review back in May when I first tried Johnny Smalls, I would have given them a solid 4 for the whole experience. It has a cool vibe and c'mon, it's AYCE tapas for Christsakes, for a mere $20 (with the Rockstar Club Card). \n\nFast forward to this past weekend: The AYCE tapas menu is not as vast and delicious as before. Be warned that some of the more expensive items will cost an extra $2-$4, EACH TIME you order them. Oh boo. \n\nThe Shorty (a deliciously braised short rib), the tuna sashimi, the grilled PB&J, and the crab and artichoke dip are the only items worth noting. Our server was quick and friendly. \n\nExpect the hostesses to be in their own little world and to barely acknowledge your presence."
0,"Went here for the Easter egg hunt and hay ride on Saturday. This place was awful!\nThe hay ride was supposed to start at 11AM. We got there at 10:30 just to be safe. We then had to fill out a waiver and each adult had to pay a tip to them of $5.00. They only had one hay ride truck for the over 100 people there! we had to wait outside in the hot sun for over an hour for the 1st peoples hay ride to finish. After the hay ride my kids and were supposed to then go to the Easter egg hunt. While getting off the hay ride, we witnessed the ranch worker dumping empty plastic eggs all the ground. We cam there for the candy and my kids were really let down. This was disappointing as it seemed like it would be a great family day if they got their act together."
1,"Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee."
0,"While searching for the ticket counter to Stomp Out Loud at Planet Hollywood, hubby and I were approached by some random guy who apparently thought we were dressed nicely enough to get into Prive.  He stuffed wristbands into our hands, completely ignored our protests that we don't go to nightclubs, and stumped off to harass other people.\n\n*look up at Prive with its impressive facade and gigantor video screens\""\n\n\""look back at dude in his skeezy hoodie and pants so baggy they might have been holding 24 hours worth of doo-doos\""\n\nAll in favor of giving this place a miss ... aye!  Motion carries, moving on!"
1,"Well that certainly was delightful! I'm really impressed with this place. \n\nVery professional and great customer service. I was greeted warmly when I arrived and offered a bottled water. Fantastic! I've never been offered a drink at a nail salon. The guy that greeted me escorted me to the chair and introduced me my tech, Lucy.\n\nThe place is so CLEAN. All the techs wear gloves while doing pedicures and they immediately clean the tubs out after every patron. I watched them do it every single time after every person while I was there. What a relief!\n\nThe atmosphere is just different than your typical nail salon. Everyone seems like good friends. It doesn't feel like anyone is talking crap about you in another language (you know what I'm talking about).\n\nBest pedicure I've had for the price. Hot stone massage included with a basic pedi! Mani was excellent as well. Very thorough. So relaxing. $5 upcharge for callous removal must be a new thing as it happened to me at another nail place and I wasn't happy about it.\n\nThe prices are so reasonable for the quality of service. For a basic pedi/mani combo is $34. Well worth it. \n\nI will definitely be back!"
0,"Went for dinner last night, they have closed.  Don't know if it's just a remodel or whether they are out of here..."
0,"Whoever runs this place should be fired!  I was in town to play a Video Poker Tournament at Bally's.  I was up playing poker until 6:00am and was up around 10:00am so I was pretty tired and too lazy to walk/drive anywhere to eat.  I always see a long line whenever I walk by the buffet.  I just thought the food must be OK.  Boy was I wrong!!!  \n\nWe didn't have to wait at all since we were able to go through Diamond entrance.  The cashier and host were very nice, so no complains here.    Long long time ago when Paris first opened, we did dine here once.  I could not recall my experience but I am sure it wasn't bad enough for me to remember it.  \n\nThe host led us to our table and took our drink orders.  She said to go ahead to the buffet and our server would get our drinks.  Well, when we returned to our table after getting our food, the drinks were not there.  When the waitress finally showed up, she had to ask what we wanted to drink again!  After she got our drinks, we hardly saw her again.  She was more interested in cleaning up tables than serving tables.  Maybe she should have taken a job as a bus girl instead of a server.  I had to flag her down a couple of times to get crab cracker (not sure if this is what it is called) and wet towelette.  She never came by to check if we needed refill or anything.  \n\nAnd the food was the worst buffet I have ever seen.  The selections were very minimal.  The only thing good was the omelet from the omelet station, but who can mess up on omelet!  The crab legs were OK.  The crepe was bleh.  I also got a thin cut of what I thought was roast beef, but I am pretty sure I got lamb.  I don't eat lamb and I know the smell of lamb.  I couldn't tell until I sat down on the table and smelled the 'funny smell'.  I couldn't even take a bite.  I am really upset the lady mistaken the lamb for beef!  \n\nI walked around trying to find something else to eat but nothing really looked appetizing.  I settled for a small bowl of salad.  I figured I could just get some dessert to make me happy.  When I walk around the dessert 'house', the place looked deserted!  There was nobody attending the dessert house!  There was no cookies, no cakes, just a few pieces of pies, and a soft-serve station.  I was a few fruit tarts inside but I couldn't get to them!  What the hell happened?  This is Paris!!!!  It's supposed to have good pastries, right?  \n\nBoth my fiance and I left in great disappointment.  And I am really upset I wasted $50 from my comp credit for this sh!%ty buffet!  My fiance filled out the survey card, but I am sure it'd just be thrown to the trash can.  \n\nOn my way out, I really wanted to tell all the people that were still waiting in line to 'run'.  There are plenty of other places to eat buffet.  Don't be lazy like me, because you'd pay for it like me and hate yourself afterwards!"
0,"Food is decent but management attitude is atrocious. They feel they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat here. Close friends who live nearby and visited at least weekly were told they had to leave in 45 minutes because they were seated at a 4 top after asking to be moved from a cold and drafty 2 top. Hostess and Manager told them they'd have to leave because they \""rejected\"" first table. Appalling lack of customer service. They won't be around long with this type of attitude. Unfortunate because food is decent. One other negative : extremely noisy atmosphere."
0,"Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good."
1,Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!
1,"I came here with my gf one night for out \""nice dinner\"" and i had a great time. The food was excellent and the service was awesome. \n\nI had the prime rib, at $45, and my gf had some kind of fish, at $35. With a glass of wine and cocktail with dessert, the bill came out to around $150 with tip. Pricey...but i knew the gf would enjoy it so it was worth it. The dessert we had was banana cream pie. It was covered with whip cream and caramel sauce. It was so good...and was pretty much the cherry on top to a great experience."
1,I found nothing wrong. Nice staff. Food was fine. No complients here :) mananger was super cool.!
1,"While I'm not usually the biggest fan of eating in hotel restaurants, particularly in Montreal where there is an abundance of good spots all over the place I must make the exception for Le Montrealais.  I came for the afternoon tea and it was an excellent experience.  It costs about $26 but once in a while it is worth the splurge.\n\nThe waiter brings out a variety of teas at the beginning to allow you to sniff them and decide on which one you want.  They have a pretty good selection and it is hard to choose just one.  In the end I opted for something traditional like Earl Gray which hit the spot.\n\nFoodwise they bring out a variety of traditional tea foods like finger sandwiches, scones and pastries.  The cucumber watercress sandwich was quite good and the scones were divine.  They were served still warm and had a fluffy interior but a crisp exterior.  Pastrywise the strawberry tart was pretty good.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the crust but the pastry cream and strawberries made up for it.  I also quite enjoyed the macarons."
0,"Hakkasan was a very bad place to go to. The place was way too crowded while the designs were confusing, small and not roomy. The bouncer was very rude and disrespectful. He would pushed my back pretty hard when it was too crowded and i was kind of forced toward the table and touched the crowd control rope which i didn't mean to. Horrible place to be at if they continued on treating their customers like this. Music was not that great, the hip hop floor was super small, and there were too many stairs which can cause people to trip."
0,I attended a private event here and I thought we would have the whole club to our self instead we had to share it with regular customers too which seemed really weird.\n\nWhen I checked in I was given a special VIP pass and told to have a good time.  I was also told that there were special VIP areas for me that I had full access too.  The problem was that all areas were roped off but I had no idea which side was VIP and which side was not VIP.  I found it kind of funny because with my VIP pass every velvet rope was lifted up for me.  Yes that is cool but what side should I be on.  It was a little confusing.\n\nWe also had passed apps and the staff serving them were really nice but it was some of the worse food I have ever had in my life.  I honestly could not even call it food...Costco samples tasted better then this stuff they were serving us.  I would have expected more from a location in the Bellagio.\n\nThe bar near the windows was also really packed and I could not get the bartenders attention to get a drink.  I then spotted a bar way on the other side and decided to see what was going on over there.  I had to go through two Border Patrol check points (guys with the velvet ropes) to get there and still had no idea if I could get a drink down there.  I asked the bartender and she said sure...okay things were starting to look up.\n\nI will tell you that seeing the dancing waters from the backside was unique.  It is also a closer vantage point then standing on the street.  My two stars are for the five star view.  The only thing I hated is that the non-VIP party had taken all of the best viewing areas and were clinging to the window where the water show was at.
1,"I've been back a couple of times since the initial visit. The service has definitely improved. The food is actually pretty decent. I usually order the Bun Bo Hue. It is a tad oily but overall full of favor. \nHowever, in my last visit, I noticed that they changed their serving bowls. They claim it is better to \""hold the heat\"". In my opinion, it just looks smaller. I believe it is smaller because my gf were able to finish her meal...which is rare. \nNow....I am deciding if I should return since the portion to cost ratio is no longer fair..."
1,"This place is pretty awesome! I was able to taste-test a bit and figured out just the right red that knocked my sox off ( a great cab). Their selection wasn't quite as large as I anticipated but it was great none-the-less. Service couldn't be friendlier and I love the fact that they have tasty treats, art, and wine/beer all in one place! We had a nice group of 8 + a pup and all had a lovely time!"
1,"The Sparklings was a fun dining experience.    \nWe were there to celebrate my birthday dinner and it was the first time that half of us has been there.  \n\nThe food was good.  I especially liked the zucchini fries and the Gorgonzola Flatbread.    The rib eye was delicious and I like the way they make their mash potatoes.  \n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere and how spacious it is.  Their furniture makes it feel fancy.  The servers are all really nice.  Our waiter was funny and they comped some of my \""birthday\"" shots.  \n\nI can't wait to come back.  Their prices are affordable, the atmosphere and service is great and the food is delicious!"
1,Always has a good selection of local beers on tap. There deli makes delicious sandwiches fresh and fast. They also have a wide variety of craft beer on sale. They make there own brand of coffee sold by the counter and also carry Zapps chips from Louisiana which are the best brand of kettle chips known to man
1,"Came here for the steak and eggs!! It says 3.99, but it actually comes out to 4.49. But that's ok. The customer service is kinda bad, It seems they're always frustrated.  \n\nAnyways, the steak was full of nerves and fat but had good flavor. When they ask you if you want toast or biscuit in gravy, get the toast!! The biscuit in gravy is always cold and the gravy tastes like its out of a can. \n\nI suppose I would recommend this place, I get a lot of food for a little money, and that's good for a student on a budget!"
1,"This place is a must!! I get my eyelash extensions done here and Yo (who is the owner) is amazing!! She truly is one of the best, and I've been getting my eyelashes done for years! The prices are unbeatable - it's insane how affordable she is! I have also had the pleasure of having Kim do my eyelashes as well, and she does a wonderful job too! Both ladies are extremely nice and have worked to accommodate my busy work/travel schedule to fit me in when they can. That's the only negative about this place, it's sooo busy, the appointments are hard to come by since my schedule is super chaotic as well. But you will not be disappointed, Yo and Kim will make you happy with whatever service you happen to get.  Thanks ladies - customer service is still alive at Yo Spa!"
1,"This restaurant is about as first class as it gets.  The food and service were just spectacular and the ambiance quite romantic.  It's a very good place for a nice dinner for two with your spouse more than anything, although I saw all kinds of people there. The menu is a bit pricey and everything is a la carte, so be prepared for a big check.  I loved the whiskey menu, quite extensive."
0,"Certainly not the best sandwich I ever had. When I stopped in after passing the billboards making these types out outrageous claims I thought I was in for a treat. \n\nTurns out I found the layout to be confusing along with the menu options. Staff didn't seem to helpful and the dining room area was dirty to the point where I had to clean my own table. \n\nThe food wasn't bad but in my opinion didn't support the claims. It was a regular turkey sub with some extras, nothing special about it. If I'd had to make a life of death choice between Capriotti's or Subway I'd go with Caps. \n\nThe choice is yours..."
1,"Nice. Oh so very nice. Not as nice as the Aria or Vdara, but damn close. The only thing though about the Cosmopolitan is that it felt very cluttered and congested. It was hard to navigate through the casino and multiple floors of well, everything. We couldn't even find the sushi bar that we wanted to eat at and we couldn't locate any employees to ask for directions. \n\nStill a nice hotel though. I can't imagine what it would be like to stay here. One of the few hotels in Vegas that actually have a balcony and a minibar. Pretty sweet."
0,"Okay, gave them a second try and I'm afraid it wasn't much better this time around.  This time I ate it right away (a short drive back to work, less than 10 minutes) rather than refrigerating it like last time.\n\nStill with the stale bread...what gives?  Can someone tell me if the bread is supposed to be a hard crust-style bread or if it's supposed to be soft?  The end that was not cut was super hard--crunchy like a cracker.  What a huge turn-off.\n\nI got a Vito this time, hoping to salvage my last experience.  Again, still not much in the way of flavor except for the onions.  I would have figured the salami would have contributed flavor-wise...not so much.  Pretty much I ended up with a stale onion sub.  Ugh.\n\nJimmy John, I'm sorry but I'm so not impressed."
0,"After hearing a few individuals talk about Filibertos at work I thought I would give them a try.  Sadly to say after 3 different meals and visits to their drive thru I have to report the food is beyond edible or palatable.   On two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting.   I attempted the chicken quesadillas were sandwiched between two massive tortillas with queso slop not cheese, the chicken tasted like canned chicken that had not been opened in years.  Instead of putting sour cream and guacamole on the side it slopped on inside which added to a even sloppy mess.  The flavors were so bad that this expensive mess had to be just thrown out.  With all the options there are for Mexican food....runnnnn to somewhere else.  Serrano's was heaven compared to this place."
0,"There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea & good location could have done allot better!"
0,Not really thrilled with this place.  I expected more of an interesting beer selection.  The food was good but nothing to rave about.  Our salads and entrees arrived back to back which I was not thrilled about.  The inside was nice and the staff friendly.  My husband and I agreed that it was not good enough to go back to.
0,"The only time i got to take my family out to the only puerto rican restaurant in AZ, we were treated like outsiders. I had called ahead of time for a reservation, party of 10 and all she said was no reservations needed, that to arrive about 8pm and we should be fine. Well, that wasn't true. When we arrived, we were not welcomed and they ran out of RICE! How can you run out of rice when we mentioned a party of 10 would be arriving??? They did NOTHING to accommodate us. And we drove from Goodyear. Was NOT worth the drive..."
1,"Had a great stay at Antoine's Garden B&B!! First, it's got a great location, one block from the central bus station, and located at the robust corner of St Denis and Ontario. With plenty of bars and restaurants to go to nearby, and with the exciting Latin Quarter just up the block, there is no shortage of places to visit within walking distance. \n\nThe B&B itself was very nice. Friendly staff 24/7. Quaint decor, especially the staircases and wall art. A rather bountiful continental breakfast with more than just the traditional toast and coffee-- a generous spread of pastries, eggs, yogurts, cheeses, ham, cereal, and on one morning, croissants!\n\nThe room was a good size, large with a comfy bed. My only complaint (and a 0.5 star reduction) was because the rooms were not well cleaned on my days there. The bed was made and the room was tidied up, but the towels were not replaced when left on the floor.  4.5 stars,"
0,I took my dog there for the first and last time over the christmas break for one day of day care.  I almost didnt want to leave my dog but I was running late for work but when I dropped my dog off I noticed that they were way under staffed and had probably 60 dogs there and only 2 staff members (things looked way out of control).  I met Steve (the owner) and he seemed oblivious or didnt care when I pointed out my concern on the staffing.  \n\nWhen I came to pick up my dog they had about the same amount of dogs and only 1 staff member there.  When my dog got in the car she smelled horrible and was very shy at first.  I had prepaid for a five back so I immediately called and asked for a refund but it took steve days to refund me back my money which showed me that they dont know how to run a business properly.  To say the least gilbert dogs 24/7 seems very under staffed and unsafe and I would never recommend it to other people and they should possibly be checked out for health code violations. \n\nIf you love your dog find another place for day care.
1,"Unlike most places, this place is NOT stingy on the toppings! Love that! I got a salad, made just the way I like it, and it did not disappoint. I'm a big meat eater and I hate when places are stingy on the meat! Plenty of choices for the non meat eaters as well :)   Staff was very friendly and prices are great!\nThe only downside would be the location. It was kind of hard to find."
1,"I don't go to Starbucks anymore. I used to, but I got sick of walking in and having all the 'cool' people, sitting with their Macs, sipping their caramel soy fuckwad machiato Americanos giving me the once over as if i'm a bigfoot sighting or something. \n\n\nIt's a real joke. \nI walk in and all the sneaky laptop whores quickly steal a furtive glance at my distressed fashion and shake their heads, signaling I don't belong here. Not like this. Not with them...all dressed-up and ready for work. \n\nThey probably don't know, or rather, how could they know I live next door. And how easy it is to roll out of bed, pillow perm and all, dressed like a major buttmunch as I wander in half asleep for my morning espresso, costing me around three bucks. \nI never did get this.\nIf taking a laptop with you to Starbucks is so vital to your existence, how is it you're so easily distracted each time the door swings open and the bell rings, heralding the arrival of a new, and potentially off the charts beautiful person, you pretentious douchebag!\nSo anyway, who needs that shit, right?  No more Starbucks. \n\nInstead, I bought a Keurig coffee maker. The one that uses those little K-cups. Only the K should stand for kablastafucked since the price of a K-cup is somewhere just south of a Bentley Continental GT convertible.\n\nAnd this is why I go to Costco. This Costco in particular.\nYou can buy a box of fifty-four Starbucks K-cups,  their Verona blend for only 36 bucks. \nBuy them anywhere else and you'll pay double.\n\nSo now I sit and bang out Yelps on my laptop as I drink my morning Starbuck K cup....not a pretentious douchebag anywhere in sight. \nWell, except for me of course.\n\nNote: 54 K cups lasts me close to a month. That's 36 bucks for the entire month. \nI used to spend that in a week at Starbucks while getting judged in the process. \nNo more."

0,"Ok,,, i come here only for the lychee smoothie with boba.  I like it here for some reason.   I have tried the food at other locations and found it to be solid, never an issue buying food here. Hey we all can  have a bad day,,, well i ordered the pad thai,, well first mistake ordering a thai dish at a chinese joint... DOH,,  I ordered it med spicey,  it was plenty spicy, over powered the dish, the pad thai sauce was weak, the veggies didnt seem too fresh, the noodles were ehhhhhh.  The normal large portion was not so large.  I usually cant finish my meal, but i did tonight... I was disappointed in my selection tonight,  I will eat here again but i will stick to chinese food not thai... The boba was good though...  This joint isnt bad,, if i were with friends i would eat here, its not the best, but i give it a 2stars for my meal tonight.... Hope this yelps...\n\n06/17/14\nQuality in food has gone down hill... Food quality is inconsistent, ranging from \""okay eat it or have nothing\""  to disposal will like it...  No longer a fan..."
1,"(Note, there are two listings for this same restaurant on Yelp - the other is listed as \""America Restaurant\"" http://www.yelp.com/biz/america-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:Jf3KrDuLYfIVeMXPEYZKEw/)\n\nItems sampled:\nCoffee\nFrosted Flake French Toast\nMonte Cristo - Black Forest Ham, Sliced Turkey, Gouda, Brioche\nApple Fritter\nBoston Cream - Chocolate Iced, Custard Cream Filled\nMonkey-See Monkey-Donut - Bananas Foster-Filled with Chocolate Icing, Toasted Nuts\nNutella Cronut\nCandy Cake - Chocolate Cake Donut, White Sprinkles, Chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\n\nProbably not the first place on most Las Vegas gourmand agendas, the 24/7 \""America\"" at New York-New York Casino had always interested me if only for its kitschy design plus one of the city's few Monte Cristo sandwiches, but it was not until I heard about the restaurant's in-house donut program that I finally committed to an early morning visit; the expansive restaurant largely unoccupied as servers joked around at the bar while \""American\"" Top-40 played from speakers hidden by the enormous map of the good ol' USA.  Featuring a menu of expectedly American classics ranging from pancakes and waffles to country fried steaks and eggs it was with a bit of disdain that I arrived to find the Monte Cristo now relegated to the 'lunch' menu but happy to accommodate given the restaurant's 24-hour nature it was with a simple request that the sandwich was prepared and arriving on a covered plate alongside the Frosted Flake French Toast both dishes would prove competent , though nothing to write home about, with prices and portions both in line with other Las Vegas Boulevard breakfast joints thus leaving plenty of stomach space for a sampling of the restaurant's deep fried dough.  Featuring no less than a dozen different varieties with three cronuts plus fritters, crullers, filled, raised, cake, and fancy on display it was with a bit of indecision that I pondered my options and eventually settling on a few personal favorites plus those most interesting a quintet was selected at a total of $12.50 and aside from the lackluster, artificial banana flavor of \""Monkey See, Monkey Do-nut\"" the results were very impressive indeed; the 'cronut' as close to Dominique Ansel's original in texture as I've found (a plus for those seeking authenticity, though I still prefer Coco's rendition to both,) the Boston Cream featuring surprising subtle custard inside a delicate yeasty pocket, and the apple fritter rife with fresh fruit beneath a delicate sugar crunch plus plenty of cinnamon rivaling some of the finest I've ever sampled; the best in Las Vegas by far."
0,"If you live in the city of Pittsburgh and don't want to drive to Wal-Mart, Giant Eagle - otherwise known as \""the Dirty Bird\"" or \""Gian' Iggle\"" if your accent's just right, is where you will shop. Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \""Market District\"" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \""discount\"" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \""We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\"" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \n\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \""Market District\"" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \""excitement\"" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\n\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \""Dude, what the fuck,\"" and the response we got was, \""We didn't do nuthin'!\"" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \""valuable grocery coupons.\"" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \""valuable\"" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\n\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it's a grocery store, and a below-average one at that."
0,Beware! Place has become pretentious. Cover for women now and expensive drinks.

1,"Some folks are too tied to the fact that a celebrity chef is behind an eatery. Some will go just because a chef they like is behind it, and other refuse. Forget all of that crap. Go here because the food is fantastic.\n\nRight on the casino floor, Mesa Grill is right behind Ceasar's huge sports book area, adjacent from the popular Pure night club. Behind its huge glass windows you'll find amazing upscale southwestern food. Tons of flavor (lots of peppers, spices) and a very nice variety. \n\nFirst off, dig into that bread basket as it has some killer cornbread in it.\n\nMust-try items:\ngoat cheese fundido -- c'mon. how are you not going to not love this?\nPork Tenderloin -- amazing. CRAZY good\nshrimp and grits -- satisfying\nTiger shrimp tamale -- tasty\nBlue corn pancakes -- delicious and fun\nRoasted corn -- it's a side dish, but really hits the spot.\n\nI tried the dessert churro and didn't dig it, but otherwise, very good food!\n\nOne thing: Nothing here is mild. If you're on, say, a date, and want to avoid spicy, bold food, this may not be the best place for you."
1,"Romantic, urban and cozy.  Three things I love in any restaurant.  \n\nIt's a little pricey but a great place to go for a special occasion.  Order the osso bucco, it's divine.  Leave room for dessert, and if you are a fan of sangria, such as myself, I'd recommend ordering that too.\n\nOur server was incredibly polite (as well as the gentleman who didn't let our water classes even get to half full)."
0,"MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food."
0,Tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am I disappointed. Usually I really enjoy eating here at least once a week. Tonight I placed my order and 3 min later I get a call that they are out of steaks and out of sweet potatoes. I know this is not a major issue but to me if you are a landrys affiliated establishment this is unacceptable. \nI WILL not be ordering from claim jumpers for a long time now.
0,don't waste your time! this place is no longer open.
1,"Probably the best place to eat at the dead of night in Las Vegas. Cheap sandwiches ($6-7) and open 24 hours.\n\nNothing really bad to say. Drunk food or sober food, both great and at any time of the day."
0,"So I order a taco salad and there were nats in it.  Is that not some kinda health code violation? I was so grossed out I instantly got sick and threw it away. Maybe it was my fault for trying to eat at a place of boulder highway. My usual experiences at del taco is good and so is the food, but because of the experience I will think twice before  going back."
0,"Pleasantly surprised. My room had new, very comfy beds.  No view. Price and location are great.\n\nIf the following did not happen, 3.5 stars.\n\nHowever, service is lacking. Security was rude and ignorant. Manager was rude as well.\n\nBetter places to stay for the same price. \n\nIt is competitive and after that slap in the face I will certainly go elsewhere."
1,"WIN\n+no other university has an arena like this.  5 Stars for engineering novelty!\n+architecturally historic: was the largest building of its kind when constructed\n+it is small enough to host high school events, big enough to host professional events\n+Illini Basketball fans are active and lively\n+it can get refreshingly loud if the place is full and the Illini are workin on a come-from-behind win!\n+if you like orange, you'll love it here\n\nLOSE\n-apparently the Hall needs a lot of upkeep and upgrades because it was built in the mid 1900's\n-it is on the outskirts of campus so there is not much to do within close walking distance if you are inclined to walk to a game.\n-everybody in the building is white except for the basketball players."
1,"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down.  If you've never been to Nikko, prepare yourself to pay accordingly.  Let's face it:  Pappy Van Winkle costs a hell of a lot more than Jim Beam but it tastes a hell of a lot better, too.  And so it goes with Nikko.  You can save money by eating at Sushi 101 but you won't experience the superior quality fish and preparation.  \n\nI'll admit it...it can be a bit of a surprise when the music suddenly becomes louder and Joanna comes out with her tambourine.  You know it's coming, you just don't know when.  Batten down the hatches and prepare yourself for it ahead of time.  Winning a saki bomb throwdown is not one of my finest restaurant moments, but I can mark it off the bucket list.  You should, too.  The atmosphere is extremely clubby and most of the patrons are, well, clubtastic.  \n\nSo, now that you're prepared for the price, the dancing, the tambourine, the cowboy hat and the clientele, you need to prepare your mouth for the most delicious sashimi in town.  The uni is wonderful salty deliciousness.  The blue fin toro will melt in your mouth like butter.  And so on and so forth.  I only wish that I could get a bowl full of fried shrimp heads without having to order the sweet shrimp.  I just can't stomach those snotty little bastards.  Joanna!  Save up your shrimp heads for me so I can have a delicious bowl of them every time I visit!  Please!"
0,"This is place is horrendous, it's dirty, unorganized and the employees are so rude and unhappy, I recommend to everyone to never set foot in this place! I am a local business owner and I send out multiple packages a week, I was so excited that this place started offering the USPS store, making it more convenient for me to ship since it is in the same complex as me! Unfortunately, the employees are awful. They are not trained in customer service or how to do any USPS transactions. Every time I have been there for a simple transaction it takes about 20 minutes and the employees have no idea what's going on. It's always different prices and it takes multiple attempts of printing out receipts and postage for them to get it right. I've complained to the \""managers\"" on duty multiple times and have gotten a rude response about how the owner doesn't care and they aren't trained to know the USPS part of the store. The last time I was there, a gruff lady was cussing and complaining about her job to other employees, it took her 10 min to come over and help me, when she finally did she gave me the wrong box size and after I had packed, taped and labeled it, she told me that she gave me the wrong box and that I would have to unpack it and pack it into another box! Clueless! I think the owner needs to step in and train the employees in customer service and how to use a cash register!!!!!"
0,"Why is it, there are 20 something registers but only 3 open? Every time I go there in the evening, there's always a line and I mean line as in 10-15 people in 2 lines. \nAlso why the crap do I need to show my receipt when you just seen me walk from the register after paying for my items?"
1,"I will keep this short and simple. \nService - awesome. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is so nice and attentive! \nDining area- we requested to be seated in the wooden weavy basket area. Love the layout. This is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner! (We were just a party of two though)\nAppetizer- Dungeness crab cocktail. Okay. I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good. \nSteak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! \nSeafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \""arreganato\"" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. \nSides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!!\nLobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides. \nDidnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake. Lame. Next time! \nOverall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $$$. Try the fish!!!"
1,"Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \""happy hour\""; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!"
0,"Not sure what everyone raves about, service was terrible, and the crowd was thin.  I didn't eat, so I can't tell you about the food, I was going to eat, but based on how long it took to get a drink I went to Mac's to eat and you should too."
1,"Came in on a Monday afternoon,  no wait and almost empty restaurant.  Yesss. Good came out quickly and was sooo good. Great place to get down and dirty with your family."
1,"Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!"
0,"Stopped there to meet up with friends for Friday fish fry. Friends had gone there in the past and said that it was and all you can eat for around $10. we walked in to empty, unbussed tables. The music from the jukebox was blaring. We \""cleaned\"" off one of the tables and wondered if were going to be served or had to order from the bar. Turns out we had to order from the bar (In the past friends that have been here for lunch have been waited on at the table). There were no menus to be seen at the table that we were at, granted we knew what we wanted. \n\nAs for the food the fish itself was decent, for a bar. Just the right temperature, I got three good size pieces, a dinner roll, side of cottage cheese, and fries ( that I felt had a bit of a stale taste to them). \n\nWe finished, I went up to pat that the bar, and was told that it was a cash only bar, but the do have an ATM. Now I can understand not accepting checks, but no credit cards? In the City? I asked for the Bill, he gave me a total for the table! \n\nGenerally I'll give a place a second shot but after that experience, it will be hard to go back"
1,Milunka is wonderful!  She wants to know about your skin and she wants to educate you about your skin!  She's so sweet and nice. I truly appreciate her taking her time when I got my facial she is great at extractions she doesn't try to push her products on you. I will be returning to her again and again.....
0,"I will not recommend this vet. It is here to take your money. There are worse veterinary clinics than this one such as Arizona Veterinary Specialists. Their prices are lower. However when your vet needs emergency, one of ours did, you expect Your vet to take over when they are open. This is especially true, when the emergency vet (AVS) is charging thousands of dollars just for an IV drip and specialized (Level X) care. This care happens to be a metal fence in a backroom. \n\nThink carefully before you use them. I'd suggest using low cost vet and making sure that you keep animals healthy by regular dental cleaning and shots."
0,Started getting a stomach ache before I got halfway into my burrito. And the taste wasn't worth it. And the salsa wasn't spicy. And the place was freezing. Don't recommend at all.
1,"This is one of the first noodle joints I had tried in Charlotte and have stuck with since the opening of many more around the area. \n\nI'll keep my review to the point. It has noodles from the major regions of the world and you choose the meat or veggie that you want. This location is a fairly decent size, but I wouldn't imagine bringing a huge group inside. \n\nThe food I always end up getting is of good quality and freshness. I've never had a bad experience here, hence, the reason why I keep coming back. Their udon noodle and pad thai isn't too bad if you're looking for a quick fix, but not the best for sure. Fairly decent pricing, depending on what meat you usually get. Waiting staff is courteous and prompt and always willing to make things right."
0,"Let's see where to begin, the menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium and had ordered it that way but it came out well over done! Also the chicken sandwich which is way over priced($9) for just two fried chicken strips on sandwich, come on you can get way better chicken sandwich at chick fil a for half that price! Plus to add on to it the chef/ kitchen staff doesnt know how to run a kitchen and an owner that doesnt know how to run a restaurant.... Over all will never return!!!"
0,"SO ANNOYING!\n\nI get that they have this whole special ambiance thing going but the \""amenity fee\"" is a bit fricking much. Basically, if you go to a movie at night or don't buy your tickets 2 days in advance, then you have to pay an extra \""fee\"", up to $3 bucks. Also annoying: having to pre-select your seats. Really? I think that if I get to the movie before someone else, I should get to pick my seat before them.\n\nFood options are decent, though."
0,"I used to like Sundance when it just opened, but it has really gone downhill. \n\nThe service is awful and the food is just as bad.."
0,"Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.\n\nI went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.\n\nI don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup."
0,"this office is the worst experience i have ever had for medical needs. although dr bhardwaja is professional in her approach, don't expect a complete physical checkup when you visit for a yearly physical. blood pressure, temp, heart rate and cursory probing of lungs is done and prostate check is accomplished, but considering i suffered from a chronic intestinal disease for many years, i was surprised that she did not palpate the abdomen area. the staff is very disorganized. had to wait for a month to get a med refill after being called and faxed many times by the pharmacy company. referral for further tests by wife not sent to the specialist for weeks slowing the appointment time. all calls are taken by an automated phone system which takes forever to get through and then, most times end up on voicemail and must wait for a long time for a followup callback. emergencies or any calls after hours are just told to go to hospital. apparently this is a \""nine to five\"" bankers hours business and would prefer not to be bothered after hours. never have we been so discusted with a business as this. am in the process of moving to another group with \""live\"" personnel. beware !"
1,"Menu, decor & atmosphere reflect the man.\nWe went with friends & shared the Chinese take out salad & a Burger. The kitchen was kind to split the burger for us. Food was fresh & good portion sized. \nOur daughter wants to try it so we will be back...don't know why NY bashed him but his menu is more West Coast flavor"
1,"Great atmosphere and the drinks and food were good.  We had several apps and all got different entrees and dessert, everyone we all seemed to feel the same.  Go with the steak over the pork loin!  We were in the back room and it was super loud with large parties but otherwise a great experience.  Great redevelopment of a historic restaurant and the bookstore next store is awesome as well."
1,"this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal, let alone the best thai i've ever had. everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere, i constantly compare it to bangkok and how i'd just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt."
1,"For starters, this restaurant was right next door to one of my favorites: Caffe Boa. This was my birthday dinner from Chad so I decided to NOT ask to go to the neighbors establishment instead of his choice. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T! D'Vine was exactly that devine! \nWe started off with a small rundown of the specials and favorites of our waitress. She was extremely helpful in explaining her favorites. I find it helpful to ask the people who work there what is good, as they usually are spot on. \nI stared off with a wine trio flight. The Rose' I found them refreshing and satisfying. I also sipped on water with cucumber, who knew it would be so refreshing (and also great to cleanse the palette). We then decided to try several appetizers or tapas. 3 different types of bruschetta: traditional (tomato, garlic, and basil), caprese (tomato, mozzarella, and basil) and brie (brie cheese, apple slices and sliced almonds) each wonderful in their own rite. Our second appetizer was the cesar salad in which we substituted the chicken with salmon.. EXCELLENT! I was pleasantly surprised at how much the taste delighted me. Our third was the stuffed mushroom. I thought it was going to be something like fried mushrooms, but it was a portabello mushroom that had Gruy\u00e8re cheese, Parmesan sprinkles, red onions and was sauteed in butter and shallots. Wonderful! Fourth and last was the fruit and cheese plate. your choice of any two or four: bleu, brie, white cheddar, gruyere, gouda\nhavarti, robusto, or featured cheese of the day served with spiced nuts, fruit, mixed olives and crostini. Sigh..\nMain course consisted of the handmade pasta (cajun alfredo) with spicy Italian sausage (Chads) and the mac and cheese. This was no ordinary mac and cheese. It was made with smoked gouda, heavy cream, smoked pork, and penne pasta. Covered in a blanket of toasted breadcrumbs, shredded cheese red onions and bacon. OMG. \nLast but not least dessert. I had the granny apple pie with caramel sauce and paired with a tawny port (cannot remember the name sorry!) Chad had the chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sauce. A M A Z I N G! I mean it... this place was awesome. Live music (think John Mayer) awesome atmosphere. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. This place was excellent. \nPrices were not too bad if you didnt have all the appetizers and wine I had haha.... I will return, you can count on that and I will be hungry when I go!"
1,"Out of everything I ate here, my most favorite was this raspberry macaron with lychee ganache. \n\nEverything else - prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc. was nothing out of the ordinary of your regular buffet. I did like the assortment though as the dishes were more thought out (ie: the salad bar isn't just a bowl of leaves, but endive salad with shrimp or something like that). They also had a juice bar..the guava juice was delicious!\n\nPricey - $58 for dinner buffet."
1,"Ahh yes your traditional Irish Pub! This is the first bar were I had the pleasure of experiencing the Oatmeal Cookie Cocktail (which they do very well by the way). Most of the Mill Ave. crowd know Rula Bula as a great bar but many forget about it as a lunch or dinner option. \n\nThey do a great lunch menu with sandwiches, Shepard's Pie ect. I usually get their French Dip with their house made fries which is almost too much food. Their fries are wonderful, basically sliced potatoes fried until they are golden brown. However, I have friends that swear the Shepard's Pie is the best thing on the menu. \n\nThe service can be a little slow as they often get hit with the convention crowd from the Tempe Mission Palms next door. However, it's affordable and just good home-style food."
0,"Place was cool the first time we went, but we decided to go out of our way again but what was waiting for us, changed it all... 2 hostesses we're sitting, talking and when i asked about the vegan menu, i got sarcastic looks and an even stupider answer. So therefore, i will never return unless i'm starving and happen to be in the Mandalay Bay. Just cuz someone is vegan doesn't mean you should treat them different."
1,"When I went in with my daughter we ordered vegetarian sandwiches and they were pretty awful.  I know they have great deli meats and such.  I complained, and they not only sent a gift card, they actually solved the problem!  I love that.  Now they have some decent vegetarian items.   When I just get a gift certificate from some corporate PR flak,  I don't even want it sometimes because they don't even address the issue.    Miracle Mile did though.  Thank you!  You get five stars."
1,"Nice for lunch and dinner, and fast enough for a work lunch. \n\nI got the Heirloom Tomato & Wood Roasted Corn salad with salmon added; delicious! The spiced watermelon and pickled radish in the salad are so good - never had watermelon or radish that way. \n\nService was quick, and we sat at a hightop near the open terrace. \n\nThey serve yaka mein, which I saw on Anthony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern (I forget) once, which I am definitely going to try soon."
0,"I'll admit, at first, I wasn't too thrilled about the idea of coming here, but it turned out to be a lot better than I expected. I guess the word, \""Buffet\"" never appealed to me, I guess. I was overwhelmed by all of the many different food choices, and I ended up having some pasta w/ Alfredo sauce and some fruit. The pasta was cooked just right, and the Alfredo sauce was bursting with flavor. The grapes were huge, and I found myself trying to eat more, although I was full. The only thing that I wasn't terribly thrilled with were the pastries. I don't know what they put in those things, but it sure ain't sugar. I'm not saying all of the desert was bad. I mean, the sugar free cherry pie was good. I liked the food, but I'm not sure if I liked it enough to go back there again."
0,"After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment."
0,"I went to Ink therapy for a commemorative tattoo and was seriously unsatisfied.  A friend has gotten two tattoos from the artist Derek and I enjoyed the color and overall tattoos.  I decided to use him as my artist for this very special tattoo (this is my 7th).  Derek was extremely unprofessional with personal medical information and charged me more for my tattoo based on the circumstance.  The coloring of the tattoo was not what I wanted- I wanted an outlined piece with shading inside.  I received a quick work up with a mag and little highlights on the tips.  This tattoo scabbed worse than any of my large full colored ones and the spots that have healed are more dull than ones that I've had for years.  Overall terrible experience, will not be returning to this shop."
0,"It's a good concept, but poorly executed. I have been to Vapiano about 4 times and each time it gets worse. If you have haven't been before, when you walk in, it looks appealing and smells good. They hand you a blank credit card and you walk up to the food stations to order. Pizza station first, then the pasta stations. Then you take a seat and wait to pick up your food. When I went with my friend, she had never been before, she was utterly confused by the place, several people cut in front of her at the food stations, and she had to wait forever for her meal. When she got it, she said it was mediocre at best and she was never coming back with me. I have been during the work week lunch time crowd (go at 11:30am or the lines become unmanageable) and for the 5pm dinner. They do have a small outdoor seating area but don't bother as all you are doing is watching office workers go home!\n\nAs for my meal, I got the pizza- it was an undercooked bland mess. Then I got the pasta, there is a difference between al dente and hard. This restaurant needs to spend the extra 3 minutes and make sure the food is cooked thoroughly. \n\nTo Vapiano: either do table service or set it up cafeteria style, this in-between business is not working."
0,Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.
1,"good clean family fun, close to home and CHEAP! Compared to going to Sun Splash or Big Surf, sure it's not a mega park, but close, cheap, clean, and fun for the kids. We have our own backyard pool, this is a fun change of venue that won't break you."
1,"My family loves their food! My twin daughters want the chili anytime!\nBBQ is great, all the meats have explosive taste. We've had family visit from Mn and Fl..and all went home with a few bottles of your sauces!\nAnd fun...bikers and suits and families..anything goes."
1,"Love Love Love. There's not much to be said. If you make my coffee good I will love you forever. end of story.\n\nSuper fast service, clean quiet environment. They never make a mistake. I got free coffee from their drive through TWICE =-) because they said I waited too long. Thank you!!"
1,"Warning! If you suffer from Ursaphobia(fear of the bear) do not visit this restaurant. This is one of those themed based restaurants which gives reverence to the \""Black Bear\"". They have bear carvings, 100s of stuffed bears, bear hot sauces, etc. I visit this restaurant often because they serve generous portions of freshly made food. I typically go here for breakfast, I have ventured out into the lunch portion of the menu only twice so my review is basically for breakfast. If you are tired of the other restaurants trying to sell you their orange juice as \""fresh squeezed \"" then try this place. I hate when I restaurant tries to pass off orange juice from jugs delivered to their location as being freshly squeezed. That's just false advertisement. Black Bear has freshly squeezed orange juice which is made on the premises. The machine can be seen in the left corner as you walk in to the restaurant. \nI usually get the freshly made corned beef hash, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. This place not only makes the corned beef hash fresh but also the hash browns are also freshly shredded . One of the few places in town that I'm aware of that makes their own hash browns. I have also tried the Joe's Hobo omelette a couple of times. \nFor lunch I enjoyed the hot turkey dinner with mashed red potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The turkey is nicely sliced white meat with ample portions. I've never left this place hungry. \nThe one day I would stay away from here is on Sunday. The regular manager was not here on a Sunday I dropped by here recently. I must say, the place was not very well run on his day off. The manager that day definitely seemed confused and overwhelmed. The other recommendation I would make is to try to stay in the main dining room. The only times I have had slow service was when I have been seated in the side room."
1,"This is a great restaurant to go to with a big group of people and have a good time. I recently went to Battista's with my family while we were all visiting Vegas. My step-dad loves this place and always raves about it. The food is good, but nothing amazing. The only thing I don't like are the massive portions and the $20+ per dish pricing. The free wine and bread is nice. Also, Love the little old man playing accordian. Funny guy and he can probably play anything you ask on the accordian. For us, since we are all from Indiana, he played \""Back home again in Indiana\"" which if you know anything about the Indy 500 or Indiana, is a little piece of Hoosier tradition. Cracks me up that my step dad said he has been coming to Vegas for probably 25-30 years and it is the same little old guy playing accordian."
1,Very fun! I would try to go at 6:30-7ish because not all the signs work so its best to have dusk type lighting. Buy your tickets online ahead of time it's only 20 people per tour.
0,"This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread."
1,"So this place is definitely unique and a great place when you really want to go out hardcore. Friday night they have great techno upstairs...it's $5 cover and the alcohol is dirt cheap.\n\nThe only thing bad about this place is the lack of carding means there are quite a bit of under-agers, but it's still a good time."
1,"I never thought I'd say it but dammit, I have jungle fever.  \n\nPita Jungle actually makes healthy food taste good, which I didnt think was possible.  I usually go for some sort of chicken wrap, which comes with a salad, etc etc...  The hummus is also a staple in my PJ diet.  Cant go wrong with the caprese salad too.  \n\nService is something I think could be better...  The waitstaff is all pretty granola-y, which I have nothing against, but they dont so much hustle as they do shuffle around.  If you know what I mean,  No?  Go see for yourself.  But get there early, you'll usually wait a bit."
0,The steak here was not worth the price at all....i really don't have much to say about this place besides stay away.  Its not worth your money or time...however the decorations inside were very nice.
0,"So um... Matt... WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?\n\nFor one, I have been going here and enjoying the grilled cheese/tomato soup plate for quite a while. The last few times (over the course of about 6 months or so) the soup has tasted bland and almost inedible. It's not the creamy flavorful soup I remember from my first few visits. The grilled cheese is still pretty good, but I don't go there for the soup or grilled cheese alone. It's the combination of the two I really liked. \nI almost refuse to buy soup and a grilled cheese anywhere else because I feel like I could make the same thing at home for a fraction of what I pay for it at a restaurant. But I didn't used to feel that way about the plate at The Roosevelt. It was something special. But not anymore. Maybe if I didn't know how wonderful it used to be I wouldn't mind it. But as a soup (tomato mainly) aficionado I have left the last few times feeling unsatisfied.\n\nAlso, I dunno what's going on but the service here has really gone downhill. My last waitress (who I have heard complaints about before from friends) was super rude to me. On my last visit I met up with some friends who had already been there for about 30 or so mins. I walked in and searched for them (this place is almost too dark to see anyone) and sat down. I waited a good 15 mins before the waitress came over and at first I didn't even know she was there because she didn't make her presence known. She just stood to the side of me with her arms folded staring at me like she wanted to me to hurry up and order. No hello or what can I get you. Nothing. When my food (The tomato soup/grilled cheese plate) came about 10 mins later I was not very happy with it, like I said before It's not as great as it used to be, and so I wanted to send it back. I really hate doing that but I really didn't even want to eat it. Well what seemed like forever went by and no waitress. Our waters were empty, my friends wanted more beer and I wanted something else to eat. By the time she came back (I would guess about 20 or so mins) I just didn't even feel like bothering. AND the only reason she came back was to drop off the check. She didn't even ask if we needed anything and completely ignored the empty glasses on our table. \nI mean, I don't want my waitress coming over to check on me every 30 seconds or anything but I feel like every time I go in here I just get ignored. \n\nThe one and only reason they got two stars from me is because it's close to my house and they have happy hour specials (both food and drink) all day on sunday. I'll wait for my crappy service as long as my wine is half off."
0,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n5 Food\n6 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nBy no means the best sushi.  Though weird as this sounds, grab some creme puffs!  Those are great!  But probably just from Costco.\n\nThey were also unable to figure out when we were done eating (lots of stacked empty plates with no one left eating?), so the payout was slow.  And during lunch table turns should be fast b/c people have to get back to work.\n\nHere's the cool part:  You don't (but you can) order off a menu.  You grab covered food off a conveyor belt that rides around the restaurant.  Apparently this is common in Japan.  I'd never experienced this before.  And the items are cheap ($1-$2), so you kind of just grab what tickles your fancy."
1,I'm starting to turn into a proper wanker who likes art galleries. Had the best time here today with me mammy. There was an exhibition on about witches which was very cool and interesting and some other neat paintings too. The spiced fruit scone in the cafe with cream and jam was totally epic too.
0,"Where to begin.\nSERVICE:\nWe were a little late to The going away party we were attending. When we did arrive and finally seated, we weren't offered any of the sparkling wine the rest of the table was drinking. When we finally asked for glasses, we waited...and waited...and waited...\nI wanted to get my order in so that we could get our food with the rest of the party.  This shouldn't have been a big deal; I ordered the rockfish, for my date and I to split, and then some lobster bisque, since I'd heard rave reviews (on here) that this was the way to go as far as soups.\nWe had a party of 12, and while this can sometimes be a daunting task, there wasn't much maintenance to our table.  We had the same bottle of Cava for the entire table and then each person was drinking water. \nThe bisque came at the same time as  the other appetizers, but he tried to take it away before I was done (pet peeve!). There was a lot left, so there shouldn't have been a question as to whether or not I had finished. \nDinner came and went. I requested a wine list, but the server asked me after I had finished the entree if I wanted any wine. Desserts, which are made by Tracy Dempsey, were never offered.\nThe guest check was a disaster! I think they needed an abacus to figure out how to split it. We only wanted it split three ways. Not difficult. It took 25 minutes and three tries.\nFOOD\nThis could end up being a four page write up. So I'll try to keep it short.\nThe fact that I'm in the industry shouldn't deter me from trying new restaurants. But, I was surprisingly underwhelmed with the creativity. And I would regret it If I failed to mention the lack of seasoning, I also despise SPLIT PLATE fees unless you split the plate for me, but when I'm doing all the work - don't you dare charge me 5 dollars.\n The rockfish portion could have been - and I'm being generous here - 4 ounces. I'd be surprised if it was a four ounce portion. It was four small bites. So, $25 and four bites later....\nAnd the lobster bisque...no. Under seasoned, thin, and over creamed. At least finish it off with some sherry and I also wouldn't mind a reminder that I'm eating lobster.\nAMBIENCE\nwhatever. It was dark.  The bathrooms are pretty and clean. \nI am sorry our party of twelve spent more than 60 a head at this establishment."
0,"Waited 15 minutes at hostess stand to be seated, no one showed. Sat ourselves at the bar amongst other guests, where a manager was stocking beer. No greeting from manager even. Wait another 10 minutes to see other guests looking around for service as well, but no showing of a bartender, server or even the previously seen manager. Sad showing from such high expectations."
0,"The airport is in need of an update.  It is very lack luster, there are very few healthy options for food (although this is common for airports) and there are still random Oxygen bars (do people still use these?).  The bathrooms are pretty dirty.  They have some corporate sponsored \""charging stations\"" but they are typically crowded and you can see people up and down the terminals either sitting on the floor or hustling to grab spots when they open.  Unless you are coming to or leaving LV, there are much better spots to have to lay over."
0,"This is the only \""affordable\"" and non-sit down place to eat at the Wynn which frustrated the hell out of me since this place didn't meet my high expectations of what should be in the Wynn.\n\n The first meal I had here was the ham and cheese panini which they served to me cold in the middle; the cheese wasn't even melted. When I took it back they reheated it and it was STILL cold in the middle. I just gave up after that because it was 3:00AM, I was partially drunk/hunover and just couldn't care enough to make a stink.\n\nI had breakfast and snacks here throughout my stay and I'd have to say my favorite things to eat here were the steel cut oatmeal and bran muffin. Pastries here were pretty decent.  All the other stuff was just not worth the inflated Vegas prices."
1,"I could live here and be totally happy.  The staff was over the top friendly.  My room was huge, amazing, comfortable and oh-so-cool.  The glassed in bathroom and the blue mood lighting was the best.  Don't forget to check out the spa.  Ummmmm....  Love their signature scent too.  Check their store out online and get some shipped to you.  Thanks to this hotel, I didn't mind staying in a place that got up to 106 by midday!"
0,"Not sure what the hell happened, because this used to be my go-to DD location for good service and good donuts. Today, that was not to be.\n\nWe went in and ordered a couple dozen, including half a dozen Boston Cremes. It looks like they had a trainee Finisher working today, because only one of them are frosted right, and the other 5 were done by someone incompetent. I have pics to prove it, available upon request.\n\nATTENTION FINISHER: when the chocolate frosting is too thick for the shells, you're supposed to thin it out with hot coffee, then continue frosting the shells in the correct manner. What you are NOT supposed to do is use a frosting knife and try to spread it on the shells. Two things happen when you do it wrong: the shells tear, and you have to throw away a bunch, and the shells don't get the right amount of frosting, and they look awful.\n\nAlso, several other of the filled donuts were not filled, and only had a blop of the filling on the outside where the fill hole would normally go. This newbie Finisher was really awful. I know of which I speak: I was a weekend graveyard Finisher for 2 years in my mis-spent youth, and as a Finisher, I would never have trayed up this crap.\n\nAnyway, when my coworker tried to call and complain to the manager, what she got was a snotty \""well, they have frosting on them, so technically they're fine\"", instead of something like \""I apologize for the bad food, here's [something to appease you].\""\n\nThis location normally has good products and good customer service, but not this morning.\n\nUnfortunate. I hope they can get the team replaced with an effective one. \n\nNote to DD Franchise Owner: If you want me to come in and train your new finishers, let me know... we can work something out."
1,Dined at Micky and Mooch for the first time two weeks ago. Ordered the filet oscar style with bearnaise over asparagus. Delicious. The seven layer chocolate cake is to die for. Old school ambiance. Live music which makes it a little loud. Very good service. Can't wait to return.
1,"Seriously, Woohoo! As good as it gets. The world would be a better place if all the stores treated their customers the way they do at Bob's Bike shop. Dale is absolutely awesome."
1,This the single most unique dining experience I've ever had the pleasure to indulge. Absolutely divine.
1,"My husband and I went to My Shu for dinner tonight. I can sum up the food in just one word \""YUM\""! Everything was so good, the veggies were so fresh, spring rolls to die for. I had the Veggie My Shu with fried rice. It was huge and absolutely the best Mu Shu ever. My husband had Sweet and Sour chicken and he loved it. He can be a bit picky about Asian food and this place was a hit. The service was wonderful, everyone was very friendly. I loved the open kitchen concept. I could see right into the kitchen and it was super clean. 5 Stars!!"
0,Confirm the other posts. Don't waste your time at this rude place. Show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back. Good to not need the business I guess.
1,"Very nice. We came here to get my boyfriend a much-needed haircut.\n\nA little difficult for us to find for some reason. We had a hard time trying to make our appointment because navigating the casino was a pain. BUT they were accommodating, so that was awesome. Also awesome: they had an opening on the day we called in to ask! \n\nThe people at the front desk were really nice and friendly, and my boyfriend got a really nice business-type haircut that I am crazy about. He said that they really scrubbed his scalp clean and gave him tips on how to take care of his dry hair. \n\nI wish we got him a shave, but that would've been a waste of money since he had just shaven earlier. Next time...\n\nPrice ended up being cheaper than where we usually get his hair done."
0,"BEWARE!!!  OWNER ALBERTO IS A THIEF DON'T SELL YOUR JEWELRY! Had been a loyal customer for a couple of years until I decided to sell him 3 watches over a month ago, one of them a Rolex since he is a \""Rolex Specialist\"" first as usual did not want to pay me what I wanted & when he saw I did not want to settle for less he agreed to pay me the balance of $500.00 in 2 weeks; because I had done business with him before I never imagined he would not pay me. He called me and flat out told me he was going through a rough time and was not going to pay me the balance of $500.00 he owed me and to do whatever I wanted. When I called him back to tell him I would return his money and for him to return my watches he claimed he no longer had them, I am sure he had already sold them for a good profit. I trusted him and the worst part is that I now know he never intended to pay me my asking price from the beginning but because he wanted my watches the only way he saw to keep them was to offer to pay me the balance later which he stole from me and never paid. I will be reporting him to BBB and see if they can help me because this is wrong! people sell their jewelry because they need the money and then thieves like Alberto take advantage of people in need."
0,"Got a gel coated French manicure which should typically last at least two weeks. Try not even 4 days... On multiple nails, it's lifting and peeling off. Not in to spending $60 for a gel manicure and regular pedi every few days....ridiculous.\n\nNot sure how they usually do as it was my first time here but I'm not happy with my results, or lack there of rather."
0,"Last night was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had at a nice place like this. \n\nSteak and lobster. \nFillet rare when ordered medium. \nLobster was barely warm and bland. \nThe service was less than expected too. \n\nWhen I asked for some assistance with my undercooked food the server said it was rare not even med-rare let alone the medium I ordered and took it back. \n\nThey brought back the same cut up piece of meat that we dissected together at the table to confirm it was undercooked before we sent it back to the kitchen. \n\nWhere am I at Sizzler or a fine dining restaurant? \n\nIt gets better. After complaining about serving me scraps the manager asked if I would like a whole new steak. I told her yes, the first time maybe but not after 20 minutes of this! \n\nAt this point the lobster is gone the sides are almost gone and I didn't come here and order steak and lobster to be forced to eat one item at a time. \n\nBring a new plate all together the way I ordered it. Remember this wasn't even close. Two stages off on your cooking temperatures. The center was slightly warm or even room temperature you blew it!\n\nI opted to just cancel the steak. My son was done eating and as mentioned most of my other dishes were finished also. \n\nThen the bill came and they charged me for the sauce that I was not able to eat because I had no steak! Now this morning I noticed they have charged me full price for a lobster dinner vs. the add on price of 39.00 for lobster to be added to any meal as the menu clearly states. \nHence steak AND lobster. \n\nMy wife and I enjoyed this place several years ago and enjoyed it so much we dined their two nights in a row. \n\nObviously chef Kenneth Fazel was either not running this place at that time or if he was in fact the chef during our previous visits he must have recently taken up Smoking crack because it was a night and day difference from previous experiences. \nEither this guy doesn't deserve to be at these type's of establishments or he needs to clean house and start over!!!!\n\nI'm not talking about just blowing it on a steak. You guys blew it on several levels. \n\n\nA very disappointed local!!!!"
1,"The food was absolutely delicious. I had the American Wagyu filet, which was excellently prepared and amazingly tender. The wild mushrooms side was wonderful as well and I would have been happy eating them as a meal themselves.\n\nService was also great, though the waiter confessed that although he was a certified sommelier, it was \""really just a certificate he got.\"" No matter, a brief discussion and we decided on a bottle of Gigondas that paired beautifully with the steaks.\n\nThe only real downside was, naturally, the price. However, I did not pick up the tab on this one, and I recommend you do the same. If you end up paying, come prepared to spend a lot and have a bit extra in your pocket."
1,"Tandy leather has all sorts of supplies and unique leather pieces for you to make your own bags, belts, anything leather. They also have iron stencils for burning into leather! Such a find!"
1,"This place is sweet. Complimentary valet, non smoking, need I say more?\n\nThe breakfast is and guest services is amazing, me an my new fiance have no complaints.\nThe rates are great even during BIG weekends.\n\nWill return!"
1,"I've never been to a \""bad\"" JJ before - the locations I've ever visited (LA, San Diego, Seattle, Phoenix) have all been consistent and obviously very standardized. So, round-of-applause for that!\n\nWent to the downtown location yesterday for lunch and was waiting *patiently* behind a lady who took the menu WAYYYYYY too seriously. Damn woman! It should not take 3-4 minutes to decide what smoothie you want? Should it? Or am I just an ass??\n\nWell, anyways - the personnel noted this and started interacting w/the line (of 4 ppl) and started to get the smoothie making party started. Great job!!! But, sadly - I was not asked what free power boost I wanted in mine. I really needed extra protein yesterday so boooo! Regardless, the smoothie was fantastic - had the Light Mango-A-Go-Go."
0,"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. This is the second time I have left there so unhappy. The first time my Fiance and i went in and got mani's and pedi's. they were rude to both of us and acted like they hated every second of us being there. I THOUGHT it was probably just a fluke and I gave them another shot this afternoon. ... and I wish I hadn't. I only had limited time so i picked my pink color and asked for just a regular manicure. THe girl then proceded to tell me that that the pink wouldn't look good on me. I should just do a french manicure with pink tips.I said no I just want them to be all pink. She said \""It no look good, to much pink for you\"" I thought she was joking bc who the hell says that??!! ... but she wasn't. She then told me well its only going to last 2 days with this color. So i said 'Oh is it a bad brand should i pick another brand'? and she said 'no you can do gel manicure'. I again said nope JUST the REGULAR manicure, and she shook her and and said ok but it is going to chip because your nails are so OILY..... WHAT??? AGAIN who says that ... in all my years getting manicures I have never had issues with my nails being to oily for a manicure. This literally went on for like 5 min and I should have just left. The manicure she gave me was TERRIBLE and she was so sloppy with the clipping ( she wacked them off, and the edges were like razor sharp) filing( so uneven, I had to tell her to fix spots)  and the paint job was uneven and lumpy. I literally felt like crying she was just SUCH a b*%&*h and so bad at her job. In all my years I have never NOT tipped and I did not giver her a dime more than the $12 it cost me to have this done to my nails. I just couldn't tip her. It was that bad. \n\nI WILL NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIn... there are waaaaay to many other places to give your business too in the area."
1,"One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall d\u00e9cor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe. \n\nThe first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.\n\nThe Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.\n\nThe Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. \n\nThe Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.\n\nAnother item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.\n\nThese meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. \n\nFor drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.\n\nThe food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back."
0,Not fresh and overpriced. Service lacking.
1,"I was pretty sure that no place in the 'Burgh would supplant Park Bruges as my favorite brunch spot, but Meat & Potatoes makes it close.\n\nI love the layout of the restaurant - outdoor seating, but indoors the center of the room is a large bar, with the tables in the periphery.  To top it off, the chairs have high backs, and are the most comfortably dining chairs I've sat in.  That sounds stupid, but it was enough for me to notice.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  There is a nice touch to start, in that they bring an oversized, fresh, blueberry muffin.   This muffin has the perfect, sugary and crunchy top.  And definitely share the short ribs hash for the table.  We ordered nearly ever brunch entree, and everyone was happy: Pub Burger, Fried Chicken and Cheddar Jalapeno Waffles, a BPBLT (a gourmet BLT with pastrami belly).  The portions are quite sizeable, so bring your appetite.\n\nService was equally great.  I always enjoy it when the staff are also foodies, and get excited about the menu items, have actually tried the menu and drinks, and offer educated recommendations.\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to coming back for a dinner service."
1,"Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.\n\nI've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! \n\nMoving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! \n\nNow that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. \n\nOne last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!"
1,"Yuuuuuum.\n\nSo, we came here on a Thursday night just before closing.  Sounds stupid as I write it but we had just arrived after a long day of work and travel and we were hungry.  I realize we would have had much better offerings on a weekend day and probably earlier in their service.  Don't judge.\n\nAll that said, what we did eat was GOOD.  The standout for me was the short rib pasta.  In retrospect, I cannot believe I didn't eat 4 mini pots of that.  It was really yummy.  Other highlights:\n\nCreamed corn with bacon\nSteak (?) and cheese sandwich\nTruffled risotto\nPork shoulder\nBrie\nCaramel gelato (great over their warm chocolate cake)\n\n*Bonus gold coins for the adorable mini-fryers and Chinese food take-out boxes.  As my fianc\u00e9 always says, \""b*tches love miniatures\"" and he's right.  The cute factor is high.\n\nGreat service and the price isn't insane considering the offerings.  I would absolutely come back for the weekend Wicked Spoon experience."
0,"Over the years I've been to several Wells Fargo branches and for the most part they are pretty friendly; this one is the exception.  I went in because I was having a problem with a  vendor charging my checking account and over drafting it.  Prior to this the only other time I have been charged a any fee was when they switched my account and the bank kept on billing me for a monthly fee in error which they reversed.\n\nA girl sat down with me and went over my account.  She was courteous but kept on trying to get me to sign up for things.  I told her I was good but she continued for several minutes until finally she asked what she could do for me.  Funny thing is when I sat down I told her exactly why I was there.  I repeated why I was there and she looked through my account again, the previous ten minutes she looked at my account I guess was just to try to sell me something.  I explained to her about the bank errors fees being waived.  After a long pause she said she had to talk with her manager about reversing the fee and she got up and left.  \n\nAnother 7-10 minutes later she comes back and says she couldn't waive the fee.  When I asked why? She said because they had already waived monthly fees.  AGAIN I explained to her that those were waived  because of a bank error.  I asked if I could speak to her manager but she said he was busy and couldn't talk with me.  \n\nAt the end of the day the fee didn't bug me as much as the TREATMENT.  They had me there for 20 freakin minutes and this guy couldn't come out of his little back door to talk to me for 2 seconds?  Also,  if you weren't going to waive it why not tell the person in the first few minutes, why drag it out for so long?\n\nIn the end I called the 800# and they waived it right away. If the people at this branch had bothered to read the notes on my account like the agent at the call center did they could have resolved it then and there.  Instead they were inept and a total waste of time."
0,"This place lost everything because of \""Kim\"" working the register. Lose the attitude - smile or go home. There are places where the food - or tea in this case is mediocre but the service and staff are friendly - so you return. Neither were great! There are many choices out there - go try em!"
0,"Think twice before ordering online or by phone from this florist.\n\nI ordered a $185 \""European Basket\"" to be sent to a friend.  What was shown on their website was truly beautiful.  What arrived didn't even remotely resemble the photo.  I realize that florists reserve the right to make changes in an arrangement based upon availability,etc.  However, we are not talking about that here.  The entire arrangement was different.  As if someone got 2 orders mixed up and my recipient ended up with the ugly one.\nIt would not have been difficult for Cactus Flowers to pick up the phone and let me know that what I ordered was something that they were not able to produce presently.  And then worked with me to find a satisfying solution.  Instead I am left feeling like I was taken by this company, and my friend has received an ugly arrangement that I did not order, should NEVER have been charged $185 for, and am embarrassed to even have my name attached to it.\nBased on my experience, I will never do business with Cactus Flowers again.  If you have no option but them, think long and hard about doing internet or phone orders.   There are plenty of other florists in the valley that deserve the business."
0,"Wish I could have gotten a haircut. After spending 5 minutes waiting to talk to somebody,  they finally acknowledged my existence.  She had me put my name on a list and told her I had a limited time.  I asked how long it would be.  She said 10 minutes.  They kept taking everyone below me on the list except me until almost an hour later I finally had to leave. It's like nobody is in charge and everyone does their own thing.  It wasn't even that busy and there were 4 people cutting hair.  Part of the problem is there are walls between the lobby and the hair cutting area so they can't see who's in the lobby. They didn't even say sorry when I told them.  Not only that they had my eMail and I got nothing from them.  Not cool.  I get my hair cut every 4 weeks, but apparently they don't want my family's business. If I had to describe this place I would have to call it inattentive and uncaring."
1,"Pizza Old Roma is definitely the Best Pizza I have ever eaten. Great service always, and very reasonable. If you are out and just looking for a Great Pizza this is the place. My husband is from Jersey and loves this place. Says Jersey ain't got nothin on this place. lol"
1,This place is totally Vegas. Food is wonderful. The atmosphere is old Vegas. The complimentary limo is a bonus. We frequent this joint every time we get a chance when visiting Vegas which is often. There's always a lounge singer which feels oh so Vegas.
0,"I had such high hopes for this bakery when I moved into the neighborhood last year. I've made quite a few visits there and I think I will not be returning.\n\nFirst, the service. EVERY time I've gone, without fail, I have been put off by the service. There are usually 3 or 4 people behind the counter, just awkwardly STARING at you as you browse the baked goods. They either ignore you completely or try to rush you into choosing, either way I always leave feeling like my business inconvenienced and annoyed them. \n\nSecond, the food. Honestly, it's just not any good. At all. Cookies, bagels, muffins, pastries, bread...they are all pretty bad in quality and are WAY overpriced. I've gotten, and will continue to get, better quality products for way less at the Bashas bakery 2 doors down.\n\nToday was the last straw. The rather rude employees actually made comments to each other about another customer as soon as that person left the store. I couldn't even FINISH some of what we bought today which really says something. Never in my life have I ever left a sweet treat unfinished! And my loaf of \""fresh sourdough\"" was stale and completely tasteless. I have no clue how they've been in business so long, or how they've gotten so many glowing reviews."
1,"I really enjoyed myself. Though I hadn't heard any good feedback from many of my friends. She looked better (presentable) than I expected.  The bottle service really made for a great experience. 1 bottle of ciroc for 4 girls. We drank it all and had a blast.  The cushioned bench style seat was comfortable. The view from bottle service section is excellent. It's fun to have some drinks, get up off your seat and dance with your friends.  The stage props and dancers really help this show.  I would watch it again."
1,"I came here to help prevent wear and tear on my body for the upcoming year of teaching. 12 years of standing all day is making for tired feet and tiny veins on my legs. This store had a great selection of inserts for shoes to help with arch support. The very sweet and helpful clerk walked me through which items would work best for me. She took my measurements to get me the exact size pair of socks. I left with a pair of insoles and compression socks. The store was clean, organized, and the clerks were very pleasant."
1,"One of my commitments over the past year and into 2011 has been to shift more of our dollars toward local businesses. Sure, I still buy stuff online and at some national chains, but I've also made a conscious decision to look for a local alternative wherever I can. \n\nWhen it came to printing new business cards for my husband's business, instead of taking advantage of the super cheap prices and free shipping from Vistaprint again, I turned to the directory on the Local First website for some guidance. \n\nI found a few local printing companies and contacted them all via email with a small introduction and a request for a quote for this relatively small project.\n\nSusan from Impact was the first response I received - long before others' responses started trickling in. After receiving quotes from various companies, I did a little bit of price comparison, and asked some of the companies a few more questions about recommendations for the right paper, about file types and fonts, and about turn-around time.\n\nWith regard to price, Impact wasn't the \""cheapest\"" but they certainly weren't expensive. My quotes from a total of six companies ranged between $27.00 to $75.00 for comparable quotes: 500 cards, two-sided, full color on one side, with an aqueous coating.  Impact quoted me $55.00. Four of those six companies quoted comparably.\n\nSo what made me go with Impact? By the time I had finished all my comparing and asking, I'd had several email exchanges with Susan, and every response was so thorough and so friendly and so above-and-beyond, that I didn't really care. She won me over with excellent customer care.\n\nChristmas came and I fell off the map for a week, and you'd better believe she picked up right where we left off and was very understanding! \n\nYesterday I picked up the finished cards. And it wasn't enough that the cards turned out excellent. They close at 5 and Susan patiently waited for me after closing time, as I fought traffic on the 51 and then on the suicide lane on 7th Street so that I would be able to pick up the cards in time for my husband's business trip. \n\nSome people may say, \""meh... big deal. that's what they SHOULD do...\"" But the truth is, it IS a big deal. I don't meet this level of customer care too often. So, when the product is great and the customer care is unmatched, the choice is obvious as to who will get my business."
1,"Have eaten @ Julia's 4 or 5 times now, and they never disappoint!! If you're looking for a Mexican restaurant that has FLAVORFUL MEAT, look no further.\n\nBeef,  pork & chicken are mesquite grilled, providing a fabulous aroma that greets you in the parking lot. Chile verde pork & pollo adobado are favorites. Choose how you want to enjoy these meats--in tacos, a burrito, in a salad, or simply as a meat plate with beans & rice.\n\nHaven't tried breakfast yet, but they serve it! They also, surprisingly, serve hotdogs & hamburgers,  I guess for your friends who don't like Mexican food but want to hang with you!\n\nWhy are you still reading this? Get over there! You won't be sorry!"
0,"Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately, there was no rift caused in our friendship."
0,"Ugh...... I loved Teddy's, but in an effort to bring me some happiness in my sleep deprived state my husband brought me home a tiramisu cup tonight. I was like oh this is pretty good, then I started to get to the bottom of the cup and there was this liquid in it and I take a bite. I didn't think anything of it (like I said sleep deprived) but my husband takes a spoonful and asks, \""what's this runny stuff?\"" I responded with \""caramel?\"" (Why would there be caramel in tiramisu?? Hello Brenda!)  He said no its raw eggs.  Totally NOT cool!!!! I can't afford to get food poisoning with a 5 month old baby dependent on me, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the best. I'm totally disappointed in Teddy's because it was one of my favorite places to go to, but I won't be back for awhile. Please make sure your baked goods are cooked before selling to people."
0,"I've been to Mineo's a few times, and each time I experienced the same problems that others have mentioned here.  1) There is TOO MUCH cheese, so much that all the cheese comes off the pizza when I bite into it.  This should not happen.  2) The pizza is way too hot, and since I refuse to sit there for an hour waiting for it to cool off, I always end up burning my mouth and fingers.  Not pleasant.  And the cheese issue is worse when it gets cold, so this is quite a dilemma.  3) The staff isn't very friendly, although I've noticed this isn't exclusive to Mineo's.  A lot of the restaurants in Squirrel Hill seem to have this problem.\n\nThat said, their sauce is good and the crust is decent.  Last time I was there, I ended up taking off most of the cheese and just eating the crust with sauce on it.\n\nI realize this review reads like I hate Mineo's, which is not the case.  It's passable pizza, and good if you are very hungry and don't feel like weighing the pros and cons of each pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I still haven't been to all of them, so I'm not an expert, but I do know that Mineo's is far from the best."
0,my food had no flava.......& my lava cake was burnt!!!!
0,"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE. Out of the \""nightly special\"", which was, ribs. Strike one. Waitress for some weird reason thought we ordered already when we hadn't. Just getting water to the table was an issue. Strike 2. While waiting for our dinner, we decided to visit the salad bar and there was an empty ranch container. So we waited for that to be refilled. Then we waited 35 min to get our dinner & the chicken was cold. Strike 3. If I were the owner I'd fire my entire staff and that goofy GM and start fresh. Not going back."
1,"We've used CVS Pharmacy a few times for our pharmaceutical needs.  Fortunately it hadn't been busy so there wasn't a long wait.  \n\nThe pharmacy tech is always very nice and fast to process the prescription. We usually wait there for them to fill. Luckily it has always been 10 minutes or less.\n\nWhen you are ailing, the last thing you want to do is wait around.  They do a great job of being quick and convenient!"
1,"This place is great whether you like sushi or not. I am not a fish eater, but my boyfriend is. I always order their chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of it is always excellent. My boyfriend orders the California roll (either regular or tempura coated), the spicy tuna roll, and many others. He says it's very good as well. The service is always great and the atmosphere is nice. It's a small place, maybe 15 tables plus the sushi bar. It's not fancy, but it's a nice weekly dining experience that's affordable and great food. Be advised though, they do close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner service."
1,"Took my husband to Vegas for a surprise 60th, and since deep dish pizza is his favorite meal, checked out the pizza places online and Amore sounded like a good choice. And it didn't let us down. :-)\nWe had the deep dish cheese with extra cheese, and we should have paid attention to the number of people it serves. We ordered a large, because we love pizza, and could only finish about a quarter of it. The thing must have weighed 10 pounds! A very dangerous meal, since you know you should stop eating it, but it tastes so good you just have to have another bite,and another, and another...you get the picture. :-)\n\nSince it was an estimated 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, we decided to have an appetizer. That was the first mistake of our visit. We had the eight piece serving of fried mozzarella triangles. The mistake was not because the mozzarella triangles were not good, they were very good, but they took up more space in the tummy that the pizza could've filled. \n\nAll leftovers were nicely packed up in containers for us to bring back to the hotel. Good thing we had a refrigerator in the room :-) \n\nThe restaurant has a sports atmosphere, clean tables, a lot of sports pictures around the room. Very 50s diner type atmosphere :-)\n\nWe were staying on the strip, so I would recommend visiting Amore if you're renting a car. We actually rented a car for a day (5/1/14) just to make the trip to Amore. The cab fare alone would have been more than the car rental, and that's not including the tip. (According to a web site that estimates cab fares, it was a $60 round trip fare from the Mirage hotel.)\nWill definitely do it again on our next visit back to Vegas :-)"
1,"Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.\n\nThere is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops. \n\nFarmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy."
1,The ambiance was the only thing I didn't love about this place but even that was fine. The food was interesting/unique and the service was exceptional. James our server took our experience to the next level. This place was worth all of the recommendations we got from friends
1,"This is the best burger I have had in a very long time.  If you are craving a good burger, you have got to try this place!!"
0,"Disappointing experience.\n\n#1:  They ran out of carbonation for cocktails.  No soda, no tonic.\nTheir Carbon Dioxide generator quit.  I asked why they don't use Schweppes bottles.  Answer:  The machine is a lot cheaper she said.\n\nI came expecting to pay top dollar for top shelf drinks and this was annoying.  Hanny's and AZ88 and others use fancy Schweppes bottles, why the skimping here?\n\n#2:  I ordered an $18 Kobe burger.  I know its a steak place, but I figure a steak place should be able to make a decent burger.  I was wrong.\n\n\""Kobe\"" burger was a machine-formed patty on an uncooked onion bun with a pickle and some batter-coated fries.  Denny's has a better burger.\n\nIt was very less than marginal.  A high end steakhouse should KILL a burger!\n\nHad the burger at St. Francis earlier this week.  WOW..  That's a burger!\n\nIts neat inside and I the steak I tasted next to me was great.\nService was good."
0,"Cheap sushi. Good sized, especially considering the price. The raw rolls tasted decent, although heavily seasoned. Leaves one to wonder why. Rice was almost dessert level sweet.  I've never had to throw out sushi until this place. Ate a few pieces of my rolls and just couldn't continue. Giving them a second star due to the cheap prices. If you want cheap sushi and aren't picky about the quality, then give this place a swirl...otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
0,"Not the WORST place, but nowhere NEAR the best place, I've ever been.\n\nWent in, back in January, for a dinner around 9:30, on a rainy night with my beau. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to stop, acknowledge our existence, and take our drink order. By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds. Minus that his regular fries were actually good.\n\nI'm pretty sure that will be my only experience at SPS's. The decorations were pretty awesome though."
0,Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
0,"Well i didn't like it that much, i was very excited to eat an ostrich burger and a elk burger because i never had them before and don't know about any other places in Vegas that sell them. so i did and i was not satisfied at all it was very dry, either the person who cooked it didn't know how to cook it right or it just wasn't good. Any ways my friend told me the regular burgers were better than the gamy meats. And the salmon burger was OK too. I probably wouldn't go there again cuz 13 bucks for a tiny ostrich burger that wasn't even good with fries and a drink almost 20."
1,Went here with some friends for the all you can eat dinner. Pretty cheap compare to other place and the food was good. We got seated as soon as there was a table available. We order our meats and our server was very attentive refilling our drinks and bring more meat as we ordered. Everything was great from the beginning. But beware of smelling like Korean food as you leave!
0,"Pros - inexpensive, large portions, the cheese puffs or crab ragoon as we call them at home were awesome!! If I go back, that's the only thing I'll order.  These rice was not edible....\n\nCons - food was so/so; just average.  It was quick and easy."
1,"The cheap and good burger bar place. \n\nGem of the Atwood area. AWESOMO. \n\nI love the beef thingies like burger, steak sandwich etc etc, chicken thingy was good and fish thingy was good. Lol, I'm terrible at names, but hey they change the menu often enough. \n\nGet the sweet potato fries here, awesome dips and HOW do they make it so tasty!?!?! Just a note, the normal fries give the same goodness but are made of normal potatoes. The wasabi peas, ooooohhhhhh good. Seriously, not very spicy but full of flavor. And my newbie today, quinoa salad, WOOOHOOOOO.\n\nMy dish tonight was FANTASTIC. I've never had a better steak anywhere. I had the daily special honey and bourbon steak sandwich. Flavors were bursting in my mouth, the steak was so nice and chewy, and it has the cream cheese I love, reminding me of Bob's bad breath. mmmmm mmm mmmmmm. I usually have only half a burger, but I'm proud to say I FINISHED IT ALLLLLL.\n\nOther favorites of mine are stuffed grilled cheese and the regular menu burgers, all done really well!\n\nMy man had the pineapple BBQ ribs, the flavor was top notch, but the ribs wasn't fat enough, so it wasn't soft and chewy..\n\nBring some cash, come on by (if you forget, there's an ATM). Might be crowded, even on weekdays, but its worth the wait!!!"
1,"Holy shit.  Bottle of some beer I never heard of and a Chimay.  Started with a black bean and chicken quesadilla.  Got the New York strip with a side of mashed potatoes (holy crap it had pesto in it?!?!?) and had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  Best food I've ever had.\n\nService was ridiculously good.  Never had to ask for anything, they sensed my desires.  Went #1 and when I got back they had folded my napkin.  Wow.\n\nOnly peeve about this place was that we had a party of 10 and had 9 people and they wouldn't seat us until the 10th got there.  Lame.  I say what the hell we're gonna spend almost 1k here just seat us and get over yourselves.\n\nBut, overall, I see why Michelin rated them so high on their list.  Great food, great service.  It's what I use as a bar for other restaurants, and honestly it isn't even fair.\n\nIn one sentence: Mesa Grill is the place to go for food orgasms."
0,"I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster."
0,"Not terrible food, but not good either.  I'd never go back because good food is very easy to come by out here.  \n\nI had the Sukiyaki beef bowl.  It was beef, cabbage, and onion over rice.  There was a sauce used, but it might have just been soy sauce.  I got salt and umami out of it.  It was pretty much just overcooked beef and veggies over bad rice that was very salty.  It was $7.XX, but I should have gotten a hamburger at Wendy's or a salad at Safeway, because that would have been better.  \n\nI dislike it when reviewers waste my time talking about decor, but holy straight out of the 1990's!  Really dim, none of the signs are on, and the wall menu was one of those big black panels with yellow lettering that was backlit.  It really set the stage for the D- food.  It felt like walking into a Bradley's or Caldoor in 1993.\n\nI don't want to give 1 star, because 1 star places really did something to deserve it.  This place was just extremely underwhelming."
1,I highly recommend this company for your auto glass.    They showed up on time and the technician did a great job.
1,"Brings me lots luck here, specially the 777 slot machines...  :-)"
1,This is THE SPOT for happy hour. Kids are welcome but ONLY in the patio. The potstickers and ahi wonton crisps are my fav's. Chase it down w/a glass of house chard and call it a day. Beware of the cougar's and the men dressed in Ed Hardy/Affliction gear. LOL
0,"Don't waste your time or money..... Small buffet with few options, low quality food, and poor service..   Go to the Suncoast or McDonalds down the street"
0,Really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell. Haven't been there for a while and hope they improve it.
1,"I guess it doesn't get much better than this. Only place for improvement was the table area, which felt like a glorified canteen - a posh one I admit.\n\nThe array of offered food is amazing, you surely should not come without a healthy appetite. But at 19,95 for breakfast I guess nobody will do that.\nTo avoid another mistake: don't hold yourself up with bread if you want to have a salad to start with - and do take a good look around first, otherwise you might end up well filled too soon because you still keep discovering more dishes. (lol, thinking about it now 10days later makes me hungry).\n\nWas a bit disappointed with our waiter, who for every other table he worked on had more of a smile than for us - can't say what we could have done, honestly. Since I don't want to jump to conclusions I won't say more. Maybe with all the hovering around the room to get the empty plates off they get disappointed with the puny tips some folks leave... then again, disinterested demeanor is not going to change that.\n\nBut still, couldn't spoil that delicous meal we had there ! Highly recommend.\n(oh, come rather early I guess ... only because it was low season we found a table right away, I'm sure. Waiting lines in high season reported to be dozens of yards long)"
1,"This restaurant was suggested to me by a friend.  \n\nWe were seated half way between the outdoor patio and the interior.  The restaurant is sexy and dark....hard to read your menu dark, but that's ok.  The vibe is lounge, with an extraordinary wine list.\n\nEverything on the menu looks amazing.  It was hard to choose, but we finally settled on the sausage flatbread, pesto cream pasta and the hamachi.  All were incredible, flavorful and fresh.  I was surprised how spicy and perfect the flatbread was, only because pizza crust can be tricky at a restaurant that isn't really a pizza place.\n\nWe skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that.\n\nService started great.  As the night went on, the server became more absent and we finally had to stop a random waiter to get the check.\n\nI plan on coming back.  For drinks or dinner, it's a great place to go with a group or a date."
1,"Fresh Sushi, Fresh Sushimi rolls, best Udon soup you can get in Madison ( and this is a buffet) Frog legs, Tamuri mushrooms, shrimp, and the Sunday seafood buffet is Unbelievable, even for the $20 per person price tag, it's well worth it. Fresh Wasabi too, plus Ice cream scooped out for you , not soft serve."
0,Service was exceptionally poor. \n\nWent here for a late lunch and we were the only couple in the restaurant. The waitstaff neglected us for 20minutes. \n\nThe food came out 30 minutes after we ordered and was awful! The pasta I ordered had dried out from sitting for so long.\n\nAvoid this restaurant on your next visit to lake Las Vegas.
1,"We tried a variety of tacos here (3 for $10). Tacos were all unique and tasty, but the \nSuadero Azteca (queen's special) was the standout. It was incredibly flavorful and tender and was topped with really yummy veggies. Definitely get your own of this if you are sharing. The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too. This is a great place to try inventive tacos, but can get a little pricey. I think you need to ask for chips and salsa here, as they didn't bring us any without us asking, but once brought, it was tasty :)"
0,Thought we would try it as it just opened. Food was good if pricey for Mexican (3 tacos $12.95). Extremely noisy. You cannot have a conversation ..just eat and out the door. Don't think I would make a point of going back.
1,"What would a visit to Las Vegas be without stopping by to see the Pawn Stars, Chumlee, Corey, Rick and the \""Old Man.\"" Being it was Veterans Day I thought getting my picture taken with the \""Old Man\"", a fellow Navy Vet, would be just the thing. We arrived to find several hundred other people had ALSO decided to stop by. A large crowd was outside the door, standing around, taking pictures, just hanging out. Inside was filled, shoulder to shoulder, almost too crowded to hold up a Chumlee tshirt or find those much desired \""Gold and Silver Pawn\"" key chains. We had pushed about 8 feet into the store when the security guy at the door said \""CLEAR the store for filming. Every OUT!\"" He was standing up, a big guy, so we turned around and moved outside again. Dona said \""No, we are NOT going to hang around to see what happens... \"" Anyway, happy vets day Old Man!!"
1,"I must admit that I'm one of the very few who does not care for Las Vegas.  Came here for a quick weekend with a friend who was in need of a quick weekend getaway, and she loves Vegas.  She suggested that we stay at the Mandalay Bay because of the great pool areas.\nWe stayed here 3 days two nights with another friend of ours who flew in from Portland.  \nWe never left the Mandalay property all weekend long.  Didn't need to.  Everything was self contained here.  There's plenty of nice restaurants and bars to choose from.  And there's I think 4 different pool areas including a wave pool beach area, and a rapid floating pool area.  And a 21 year and older pool area which was free for the women on Saturday that we were there, and $30 for the men!  \nWe had an okay dinner at the Border Grill.  The weekend we were there, the B52s and Blondie performed at the Mandalay Bay beach Saturday night!  Tickets were $60, but were discounted for guests staying at the Mandalay for a discounted price of $33!  The concert was great!  Especially the B52s!  They play on the stage next to the wave pool.  They shut the waves down and clear all the lounge chairs from the beach.  We watched the concert in the pool right in front of the stage!  It was awesome!\nNow for the rooms.  The rooms are spacious and so was the bathroom, with double sinks and a separate room for the toilet - nice touch - and a separate shower stall and jacuzzi tub.  They're not the newest rooms, but they're nicely maintained and decorated.\nAlthough I'm not a fan of Vegas, I'd definitely stay at the Mandalay again, if and when I go back to Vegas again."
0,"The only reason I called Molly Maids was because we got a coupon in the mail for them and my mother was coming to visit.  The first issue I had was that the number on the coupon didn't even work so I had to google them to get a working number.  I made an appointment for Saturday morning on a Tuesday.  Saturday rolls around, no call, no maids.  I call and get ahold of a \""Kate\"".  She proceeds to tell me that my appointment was lost or never properly recorded in their system.  When I asked her how they were going to make this right, she got attitude and raised her voice to me.  I asked for the manager and she tells me that she's the owner and she's the only one in the office on Saturdays......G-H-E-T-T-O  Don't waste your time with this terribly run \""organization\"".  (if you can even call it that).  My friend from back home told me that the main company is going out of business all over the country.  Now, I can see why."
1,"I've never received bad service here. I love the vibe, the music, and the drinks. \n\nMy favorite drink is the No.22. It's my go to. Berry vodka drink with blackberries. Super refreshing. \n\nEverything on the menu is delicious. My favorites include the MAC and cheese, of course, the chicken noodle soup is amazing. Country vegetable chop is my favorite salad. Their soup and salad combo is a good move. Mahi salad. I could go on. \n\nOne of my favorite spots uptown. Check it out!"
0,We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER.

We went from a slew of hotels to stay at... our heart was set on the Venetian because a) It's a 5 star hotel and b) It's sleek and sexy! Normally I stay at the Bellagio and my friend stays at the Wynn so we're used to NICE FANCY hotels... in the end we chose the Venetian and the Palazzo suite for our stay... 1400 square feet of ballin! Or so it looked like from the picture...\n\nArrived on Friday at 11:30AM to check in... my friend hadn't arrived yet so even though check in isn't until 3PM I tried anyway... LONG line to check in... LOOOOONG line! An employee saw me enter the velvet ropes and asked if I was checking in and I said yes... he said that if I didn't mind going up the elevator that was no wait to check in upstairs... score! So I went up stairs to check in... my room wasn't ready and I requested a couch with a pull out sofa sleeper but I was told that there were no rooms available with the pull out sleeper... but that if one was available Saturday they could switch our rooms... a lot of trouble if you ask me to switch rooms so I asked about a roll away bed and they said normally it's $35/day but they would give me one for free since no sofa sleeper was available. Brownie points for them! They said they would call me as soon as the room was ready but that they would hold my bags for me... easy enough. We went shopping!! \n\nI got a call around 2PM that the room was ready. My friend arrived at almost 4:30PM so we checked in thereafter. Got our keys and headed up to our suite... arrived at the END of a VERY LONG HALLWAY and was ready to see our pimpin suite... opened the doors and..............................................................................\n\nwas extremely disappointed. BEYOND disappointed! Um was this the same room as the pictures?!?!?!!? Cuz it sure didn't look like it. The rugs were worn and dirty. There was no L shaped couch. Just a dirty yellow \""love seat\"" which didn't look very lovey. Two small chairs and a small table in the living room. The living room looked... empty. Pathetic. Lonely. Everything looked... OLD. The bathroom was nice so I'll give it that. But that's about it. We called the front desk about not having an L shaped couch which I was told we'd get when I checked in... he stated it only comes with a \""love seat\"" and I mentioned it was fraying, dirty, and old and that it wasn't lovey or lovely at all and all he did was apologize. My friend and I were... confused. Debating on what to do. We were supposed to meet up with 2 other friends to go to the Wynn Buffet for dinner so we decided to go do dinner and talk about it. Talking was short. We hated the room and felt cheated! So after dinner we went back to the front desk, IN PERSON, no phone calls...\n\nWe inquired about having a room that was \""more 5 star quality\"" and the nice gentleman helping us started to show us bigger suites in his book... we explained it wasn't the SIZE of the suite that was the problem... hell we had 1400 square feet which is practically a house!... it was what was IN the suite that LACKED 5 stars! We listed everything and then he did some researching... and he showed us a different suite at the newer Palazzo connected to the Venetian and asked us if we'd consider moving there... and we agreed. He even mentioned that our suite has yet to be renovated and that it is older but that they are renovating next year... helllooooo FALSE ADVERTISING!!! The pics look NOTHING like the room itself. Ughh it was GROSS! \n\nBellman took all our stuff to our new suite in the Palazzo... and it was a BOMB ASS SUITE! (I'll write a review under Palazzo for that one)... but Venetian, you FAIL, an absolute EPIC FAIL... and never ever ever ever again will I even CONSIDER staying with you... lesson learned for me and my friend... BELLAGIO AND WYNN all the way!\n\nSide note: lots of great shopping, TAO is an awesome club!... and the gondola ride outside is super cute!"
1,BEST BEST BEST BUFFET I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo many selections! Everything is hot and fresh... and ohhhh so tasty! This is not the best buffet in Vegas! It's the best anywhere... and I am the queen of everything all-you-can-eat! If you're looking for a good buffet this should be the only place you consider!\n\n****Beer & wine is included in the price. If you're into ciders they have their own special berry cider that is to die for!!!****
1,"I love how you're able to order drinks, get cheap tickets on groupon, and eat food while watching your movie! The seats are super comfortable and they can turn into love seats if you're there with your significant other. Love this theater and try to go see as much movies as possible there!"
0,"I have to say, i am really not impressed with this place.  Service was spotty, the food was sub par."
1,"it is beautiful in here. nothing like our local fry's. very large, spacious, and looks like a high end supermarket. \n\nvery warm, and cozy if that can be used to describe a supermarket. they entry is always packed with a beautiful setting of plants and seasonal items. their alcohol department is enormous!\n\ni come here for a quick pick up after work if we need a milk or bananas. if i'm lucky, they're handing out sushi and i usually eat 4 or 5 because i'm starving all the time. \n\nvery pretty store."
1,"Great Mexican restaurant inside Planet Hollywood. Affordable,  a lot of food to share, good guacamole and salsa chips, friendly and fast service.  Nice seating area inside and outside, expectantly view. Over all - super satisfied!!!"
0,"Despite the raving reviews this place got on Yelp, I can't say that I was impressed with my experience there. \n\nThis afternoon I decided to pop by the Larder and, I must admit, my expectations were high. Inside it was lovely, but nearly empty (hey, more room for me!). However, I was greated by the waitress in a very indifferent manner, I kinda felt as if I was disturbing her cleaning/packaging routine.\n\nThe service was kind of lackadasical but I didn't mind much anticipating great food. Well, that's where I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay (no hairs in it, no dust on it), kind of. It just wasn't great. I had the pumpkin and goatcheese fritata which came with salad on the side. The fritata was ... well, ... bland really. There is no other word for it. The \""salad\"" on the side was dressed with olive oil, that's it. No vinegar, nothing, just olive oil.\n\nThe food wasn't horrible, it was just a severe case of \""I could do this ten times better at home\"". What annoyed me was that the plate looked as if someone had spent a great deal of time thinking of what would look pretty, but forgot to actually taste the food for seasoning and flavour.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go here again. It's pricey, and the food was bland to me. (Oh, and did I mention that my fritata was only warmed half-way through? The other side was still cold as it had just come out of the fridge!). Eek!\n\nI'd give this a miss, or I just caught them on a really, really bad day!"
1,I've tried Sin City Dogs a few times and their dogs never dissapoint. Ran into them at Foodie Fest and had to try the Lobster Corn Dog. Wow. What a treat! \n\nThey embody what a good food truck is all about. Nice gourmet take on popular street food with friendly workers.
1,"Discovered Tryst (Organic) Cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. Have had breakfast, lunch & dinner there. They have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. Also many gluten free choices.\n\nThey've had their ups & downs with service, but it's usually good. The happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours & choices.\n\nMy wife & I both love their Seered Ahi Tuna Salad, it's fantastic! We both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. Help Tryst thrive!"
1,"Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent ."
0,"What I get for not having the energy to check Yelp before dining somewhere is a mediocre meal like we had here.  We just walked by and randomly decided to dine here.  The hostess and our waitress were very kind - but the service was SLOW and the food bland.  Dressing up all the ladies in skimpy clothes does not make the food taste any better.  Their kitchen also needs to learn how to marinate foods or use sauces to their advantage.  Here's a quick breakdown: \n\n- bone marrow - so bland and not worth it.  The bones are not cut lengthwise, so the unseasoned marrow is deep and hard to get to.  \n- chicken panini - the chicken was dry from being over cooked and it was under seasoned.  The panini could have used some spread or sauce inside since it was very dry and bland.\n- fish and chips - the fish was okay but the fries were all little bits in both my husband and brother's order of it - it looked like they got the very bottom of the bag of frozen fries.\n\nMy recommendation is to move onto another restaurant...sorry Alexandre Restaurant."
0,"I initially was thrilled after locating on yelp was given a coupon for a free appetizer. Something I had not expected. A very nice surprise. Then when we got there were seated.immediately and atmospere was fun. I mentioned the free appetizer coupon and was told \""are you sure its Hacienda. I showed her the reponse changed to okay I am going to check with the manager. She then left and came back and informed me that she couldnt find a manger, saying since we are sooooo... busy. There at the time were 10 open tables. She then ask us to come back to use the coupon again saying soo ... busy. We just ordered and tried to move passed it. She continued to bring it up 3 more times. Became very annoying. Food was fine. I had not expected a coupon and would have probably been fine with the overall experience, but I feel it is in poor taste to offer a coupon and then not honor it. Then with the waitress continually bringing it up and making excuses was unpleasent when we had not mentioned it since we first showed her and she began with excuses. So my overall rating would be average on the food, atmosphere better than average. Most employees were friendly and prompt with service but our waitress experience was poor that combined with an enticment of coupon and then nit honoring makes the experience below average."
1,"This place is definitely a \""Keeper\"". Nice atmosphere and there is a great sense of politeness and respect from the Hostess to the Bartender and to our waiter.\n\nThe Waiter was very knowledgeable of what the daily house specials were and shared his recommendations. Wanted to get a fruity cocktail but they only had a regular mojito on the menu and we wanted a strawberry kind - it's like what they say; you ask and you receive.\nThe prices were very reasonable - ordered the \""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - \""pea & carrot\"" risotto\"" and \""NY Strip 14oz\"". The steak was ordered to be cooked medium however when it came out it was medium rare. The coolest thing happened; the manager came out and explained what happened and he asked to take my plate to get me what I ordered; in 5 mins it was right out and was perfect. \nThe service and atmosphere in this place is to die for and I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas because it's not about the \""lights, camera, action\"" but about being able to eat your food with good background music and a place that actually acts like they want you to be there. \n\nAwesome!!"
0,"Stopped in for a pedicure a few days ago.  The salon was clean, chairs were nice, and lots of them. I did not have to wait even as a walk-in.  I was hoping this might be my new nail salon!\n\nThe girl who worked on feet my was rude, bossy, and very aggressive.  My feet hurt and bruned from her scrubbing.  The water was way too hot!  She seemed to be mad at me when I didn't put m foot right where she wanted it.  This was NOT the relaxing experience I was in need of.  I will not be back..."
0,"Uuuuaaaaaaaaaaahhhhggggggggllllaahhhh (that's my puking sound). While I didn't actually puke, I'm very surprised. \n\nIt was a typical Thursday night where neither of us (*cough* James *cough*) could make a decision on where we should eat. So while driving aimlessly down the road in every which direction, we pulled up Yelp and went to the closest Thai restaurant with solid reviews. \n\nWe sat down and both of our noses turned up wondering what that smell was. James proclaimed \""it smells like a bathroom in here\"" I, however, couldn't smell what he was smelling....YET. All I could smell was cleaning products, like too many combinations of chemicals that make you wonder if someone is laying in the back passed out. I could smell bleach and something that smelled like a lavender scented ammonia. \n\nI don't know why we stayed, maybe it was the hunger pains. Maybe it was laziness, but I regret that decision. \n\nI ordered Hot and Sour soup and Egg Rolls. \n\nThe soup wasn't good, it was chicken broth with cayenne pepper dumped in. Some bland chicken and some uncooked mushrooms (straight from the package). James kept telling me to move my soup back because he thought it smelled like dirty feet, although I'm not sure how he could smell that over the bathroom stench. \n\nThe egg rolls were better but very greasy, I did like the inside however. \n\nAt some point in our meal, I finally got the whiff from the bathroom. OMG. I'm done eating, can we just go??\n\nWe thought it was a one time thing, maybe the line cook had some nasty Taco Bell for lunch, maybe their plunger broke, but after reading the reviews, this has been happening for months. Get a damn plumber out there or shut your doors. \n\nNASTY!!"
1,"The only thing keeping this lovely local business from 4 stars in my first review was what I saw as the unfocused nature of the space. But I have had two bites of food that MORE than compensate:\n\n1) Caramel Apple Pie\n\n2) Clam Chowder\n\nThe owner's pie crust is the best I have ever had. Hands down. I've now had a few of her pies and once the crust was a bit over cooked. But the others generally, and the CARAMEL APPLE PIE very specifically, are delicious. How could I leave them with three stars when the pie crust is that good. She told me that one customer came in and asked her to make a crust with no filling. And I wasn't even shocked. I just blinked and asked if that was something she would be selling on a regular basis. Her crust is that good. Everything they make is homemade. They are proud of that fact. They should be.\n\nI still think they have a lot going on in the store itself. But who cares. When a CARAMEL APPLE PIE tastes like that---tart, sweet, buttery, creamy---who am I to quibble over details? I've had plenty of their prepared food items: cranberry sauce, lots of soup, apple butter, jam, bread pudding and pies. The CARAMEL APPLE PIE is by far the best. If I was making a list of my favorite things to eat in this city, that pie (warm) with a scoop of homemade ice cream on top would be in the top 10."
0,"This review might sound a little repetitive but I feel future customers need to hear it again and again...\n\nThey really offer you nothing for your jewelry. I went there with a Cartier ring and a custom made necklace. I was offered less than the weight of the gold. I understand that they need to make money to stay in business, but damn don't take us for the ride of our lives! Just to confirm my suspicions, I drove down the street to one of those pawn superstores for giggles and they offered me more for the necklace alone than that jewelry store.\n\nBottom line, know what you have before selling it, no matter where you go! And this is certainly not the place to go to if you want to walk away with some decent cash in your pocket."
0,Beautiful place! Beds are great. But worst customer service. Only stayed here two times.  My wedding night and my sister in laws engagement party.  Slow service and rude workers. Too expensive for the horrible service.
1,"Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet, I stopped by China Chili in Central Phoenix. The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. \n\nMenu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. \n\nThe Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.\n\nOverall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either. If you want Chinese food that has a little more class that doesn't kill your paycheck check out China Chili."
1,"I love this place. They have the best tacos in town (pansita are my favorite), but not to forget the drinks (try the \""big nose drink\""), they are amazing too."
0,"It's always tough to rip on a small business, but you'd be remiss to eat here instead of the other fine options in the Sauk Creek strip mall. This is a fried chicken place, believe it or not, on the far West side. It's just out of it's element basically.  Indonesian food should have some spice, one would think. Please eat at Oliva or Swagat, but avoid this unless you got a craving for chicken and hate KFC.\n\n1 star for very friendly customer service.\n\n1 star for prices being good."
0,"I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.\n\nYes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThe establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.\n\nFirst off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place....\n\nThey had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to \""Chinese\"" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! \n\nFresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. \n\nLunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a \""Vegas\"" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.\n\nThere's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.\n\nWhy 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9."
0,"Meh... Love that it's local and the food isn't usually bad. Just expensive.\nI feel like I'm in the middle of an identity crisis when I'm there. They want to charge fine dining prices, but operate as a mom and pop. Tonight the service was poor and the \""homemade\"" pasta was chewy. Nobody asked so I didn't mention it.  Oh and the bartender/server didn't have her long hair pulled back. Ewww! Whenever I hear \""can I get another one\"" from more than a few customers, I realize it's not just me. In this economy going out to dinner is a treat for most... I hate it when restaurants forget that."
0,"I'm not sure why this place has such rave reviews... I was here December 8th and I didn't even think to bother reviewing it until I saw the almost unbelievably high ratings. I went here with a group of 7 people and was very surprised at the poor service which seemed rushed and nearly annoyed at having to serve customers. Mind you we were the only people in this place... Drinks were not refilled until I had to walk me and a friends glasses up to the counter to ask for refills. Food was alright... For the price I was not impressed with freshness or taste. Plates were not cleared as courses came out and again our server, a middle aged man, seemed angry and as though he was trying to rush us. Lastly on my second trip to the counter to request refills on water, I saw the same server opening a mochi package from trader joes and cutting the pieces into fourths. Knowing my friends just ordered a four or five dollar desert I was overall dissapointed in nearly every aspect of miko's. Worst of all my fianc\u00e9 reported to me later that night that he had gotten sick from his sushi. :/"
1,"BEST. BUFFET. YET.\n\nWynn was always my favorite just because of their quality. M was delicious because of their quantity + price. But Bucchanal...I think tops both of these. We were the smart people who got in line around 1:45 pm and paid around 2:50...just in time to pay for lunch but get dinner food! We live such a dangerous life, don't we? \nWe did have a party over 6 people, so they charged us 18% tip. (Total was $36. My friends went for dinner, and with the 18% gratuity, it was like $51.) I don't really see the need to tip at buffets more than a few bucks, but what can we do...\n\nI think one reason I really loved this buffet was because of the ASIAN FOOD. Living away from home really makes me crave this! They had miso soup, hot and sour soup, and black chicken soup. They had sushi, PEKING DUCK, and other general asian dishes. The peking duck was sweet and delicious. I ate enough of that to pay for my meal.\n\nThey ran out of salmon at one point, and one of the chefs, after asking what I was waiting for, went to go get me some. How sweet!! Plus points for great service.\n\nThey also have a ton of seafood including crab legs and oysters. All of my friends got their money's worth eating that. \n\nThey had rib eye steak, fresh-made tacos, fresh fruit, lamb chops, amazing desserts including innovative ice cream flavors, and an all-around great selection of food. \n\nDEFINITELY RECOMMEND."
1,"This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!"
0,"Bookmans is a neat, orderly store that has a ton of books - most of them are in pretty good condition.  It's a charming place where you could spend all day wandering through the aisles reading.  It's quiet, the staff are friendly, and there's a lot to see.\nHere's what I hate about Bookmans:  I'll bring dozens of books and magazines in only to be told they want to buy only one or two items.  Then they offer 50 cents in cash or a 75 cent store credit.  No one gets rich selling to Bookmans.\nThe other problem I have is that they have a website, but their inventory isn't available to the public.  Every time I ask if they have a book, they tell me to call every few days because it can't be looked up.  What do they think this is - 1970?"
1,"Great place! Incredible pedi's at very reasonable prices. The suite is clean and well maintained. They offer a variety of services so you almost have one stop shopping (add a hair salon inside and it's the whole package!). \n\nI had the cucumber pedi today. $35 gives you a standard pedicure with callus remover, paraffin wax, hot rock massage and a relaxing experience. \n\nI've been to other places, nothing compares. I won't go anywhere else and would recommend to anyone."
0,"Been there twice now (many years apart) - both times I felt like it was a waste of money.  Staff was disorganized, slow and only \""just friendly enough\"".  Quality was mediocre - I expected better for a sit-down.  We have 4 kids, 17-11 and none were impressed.  My 14 year old son wouldn't even eat the chicken fingers (which he always loves at other places or at home) he ordered - they were pretty nasty.  None of the kids want to come back - and kids want to go out whenever possible! (has no bearing on my wife's cooking - she's great)"
0,"You know, \n\nNobu is good. \n\nNobu is good in Malibu, but Vegas being the copycat of LA seems to dress down all of the cities great places and ruin their names.\n\nThe fish was \""eh\"" \""Ok\""..... not super fresh as the Malibu location and also served with the \""I'm pretending this is LA, attitude\"".\n\nGet it right Vegas, if your planning on copying an icon at least make sure you can back it up with flavor, freshness and quality."
1,"Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating.\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars."
1,had a pedi and gel mani done today! absolutely will be coming back :) everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect. \nvery very clean as well!
1,"For a place to have good drinks, play pool, and chill this is the place to go, never really super busy so service is always pretty good. Bluemoon always cold and fresh."
0,"I wish there were stars for service and food separately because I hate to give 2 stars to a place I like, but the service today was just...ugh.\n\nFirst off, I like Zoe's. It's not the greatest food ever but they use a lot of feta and I love feta. I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.\n\nToday, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice. \n\nWill I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me. \n\nOh, and they didn't burn my sandwich alright. Actually (if I could take a picture I would) they barely heated it. The cheese is still mostly intact."
1,"Dear Yelp, it's official: I AM 21. :D\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!\n\nRoom: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.\nService: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. \nLocation: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. \nPool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. \nMiscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nPros:\nMore than enough space.\nFridge in the room.\nLovely view.\nEpic pool.\nFree shuttle to the Strip.\nNice enough bathroom. \nOffered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.\nLots of things to do on the property.\nGot the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).\n\nCons:\nSneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. \n\nSuggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds. \n\nWould I stay here again? I'd stay here again just for that pool."
1,"My favorite Thai restaurant, in fact, we don't like to go anywhere else!  I drive from Summerlin area to Henderson to get my Thai fix, that's how much I love this place,\n\nPad Thai - scrumptious, perfect blend of sweet and savory, not oily or dry\nPanang curry - love the mixture of coconut and curry\n\nYou won't go wrong with this Thai choice."
0,Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.
0,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\nNot satisfying at all\n\nChiliquilllies were plain nasty. Soggy chips with green sauce. Waste of $8\n\nBeans have no flavor. No salt, no garlic, pepper or onions.\n\nMy cheese in the bean and cheese burrito wasn't melted. Nothing beats a Taco Bell bean burrito \n\nShredded beef taco was the best.\n\nCarne asada burrito was full of onions from guacamole and the meat chunks were chewy, tasteless and too big\n\nThe fresh salsa was made from  un ripened tomatoes, had no heat or cilantro \n\nToo bad the $8 per burrito locks you into buying the whole thing.\n\nCasta rasa, round corner cantina and the taco stand in front of Reyna foods has way better casual tacos\n\nThey charge for chips and salsa. \n\nChips look double fried because they are very greasyy\n\nA waste of $35 and the food left a bad taste in our mouths"
0,Small and not enough room. Avoid this place if you're bringing a whole team. Last resort.
0,"The gym itself is great. Really good variety of machines, classes and unlike LVAC, people actually work out here instead of using it as a social club. My problem is with the staff. i had an issue with my membership and tried to ask about it. The staff at the front desk said i needed to call the customer service number and speak to them so i did. I actually called twice and got the same answer both times from the operators, i could cancel my membership or talk to a club manager about my current one. Now i've been going to this gym for 3 years and i really like it here so i decided to talk to a manager about it. I've asked to speak to a manager 4 separate times and each time the same thing happens: The staff at the desk will tell me that the manager is with another guest or not there and that i can have a seat and they'll see me next. So after 20 or 30 minutes of waiting the person at the desk will tell me they don't know how much longer the manager will be and that i can leave my name/number and the manager will call me, so i do. I have never gotten a call back ever out of the 4 times this has happened. I understand that this is a gym and not some high end restaurant or retail store so i don't expect amazing customer service and its a busy gym so i don't expect help right away but to be ignored is ridiculous. Either the manager isn't getting my messages or they're ignoring it. The only reason I haven't canceled my membership yet is because like i said, i've been going here for 3 years and i really like it but this is beyond unacceptable and I've started looking at other gyms."
0,"I had such a horrible experience with Margie as my midwife. I chose her because she had so much experience and knowledge and came with good recommendations, big mistake. As my due date grew near, I realized that a majority of the time during my prenatal appointments with her were spent by Margie talking about HERSELF - her pregnancies, her health problems, her family history. Many of my concerns were brushed off and she was condescending because this was my first pregnancy. Meanwhile she would contradict herself and did not remember details about my pregnancy or my family or my medical history. I had already been paying a significant amount of money for her services, so I felt that I was stuck with her. When the big day(s) finally arrived, I truly regretted hiring this lazy woman. I ended up in labor for three days and she only came over once for about 10 minutes. I had a horrendous labor that was not progressing, and despite this Margie was not concerned about the well being of my child. On the third day of labor, when she didn't come check my baby's heart rate or check on me, I went to the hospital. I was suffering from exhaustion and dehydration, and my baby was in distress. Margie harassed my family to let her into my house to get her things while I was in the hospital, but couldn't care less about calling me to ask about my health or my daughter's health. She was supposed to provide postnatal care and lactation consulting, but we haven't heard from her. After all was said and done, we paid her $300 an hour to talk about HERSELF!!!"
1,"LOVED Mystere!  This might actually be my favorite Cirque show.  There was so much action, it was awesome.  Definitely recommended, and not a bad seat in the house!! Actually don't sit in the front row, you want to be toward the middle so that you can see EVERYTHING."
0,Not very fresh. Rice was hard. Beans crusted over. Taste was ok. Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired. With many other burrito options no reason to come here.
1,"Came here for the Phoenix NewTimes happy hour event last night. Really liked the modern vibe of the place. Cool modern artwork.\nCustomers are able to freely walk in and out of the Lucky Strike bowling alley next door which is pretty cool.\nWas most impressed with the staff. The manager, named Dallas, was helping out at the bar when I arrived. I mentioned to my date how it's always nice when the bartender acknowledges your existence and doesn't just leave you hoping and wondering if you'll ever eventually be served. He struck up a conversation with us and seemed like a real cool guy. Gave us the kind of welcomed feeling that makes us want to come back."
1,Best pizza in Arizona. Arizona had been waiting for this for a long time!!  We were customers in IL and the owners have kept up the exact same quality and service!!  We didn't want to move back to IL to have great pizza!!!  Thank you Buzzyz for always delivering a superior product.
0,BAD VERY BAD! When we leave the restaurant it was as we never eat..\nWorst restaurant I've experienced in my life time.  Avoid at all costs.  I ordered Mussels fries and it was a little plate and 10 fries with old oil...   Nobody for the water.\nThe decoration is very old! and not clean at all!!!   Avoid at all costs. The service is VERY slow.  Then they have the audacity to add service onto your bill.  What a joke! I don't recommend this restaurant! I am French and dishes are not reflecting our cook!\nThis restaurant is disgusting and expensive! The next day we went to\nThe jardin Nelson and It was really better! With the beautiful terrace and a live concert.
0,Premium price for a standard sandwich.\n\nWould have been an enjoyable visit had the deli guy been at least welcoming.
1,"I took my dog to get a cut and the man who greeted me at the door was very welcoming. He introduced me to the groomer, who sat down with me to discuss what I wanted to get done. I was happy with the cut and service. \n \nI will definitely be going back again :)"
0,"The espresso is very good. But I won't be back. Why? The guy who made my espresso couldn't be any more obnoxious. \n\nGeez. First he tells me I'm standing to far from the counter and that I have to stand closer if I want to order. Ok, I take a step forward. Apparently, I wasn't in the right place. I had to take three steps to where the line begins. Stupid me for thinking I could cut in front of... Nobody."
0,"I give this place zero stars.  I went in for a pedicure and not only did I wait for about 10 minutes (with my feet in the water) for the girl to finish eating her lunch, she cut the hell out of my cuticle.  It took over 15 minutes to stop the bleeding and then when I asked to be comped for it, all they have me was $2 off.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy.  I know I will never be back here."
1,"A great place to get out of the ordinary Chinese food.  This place can get really busy on weekend nights, so if you don't want to get upset about service don't go on a busy night, but if you have patience by all means.  It is after all a family owned and operated restaurant with all it's quirks. I personally have not been disappointed yet....\n\nMy favorites...chow fun, duck dishes and whatever fresh Chinese greens or vegetables they have available that day.  Seafood dishes are great too, especially clams with black beans...."
0,"The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!"
1,"my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there's rarely a time that we're not in the mood to eat it.  when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink, i knew we had to check it out.\n\nthe frozen horchata is served as a cocktail, and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka.  we opted to try both, and they were amazing! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it didn't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did. after finishing his drink, my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim.  i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata! \n\nchips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me, so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas (red and green) were spicy and delicious.  \n\ni ordered the chile relleno, and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese. i really enjoyed the flavors of it, and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal.  the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i've had in a while. \n\ni will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation!"
1,"Try the soondubu jjigae and bibimbap! Every meal comes with 6 korean side dishes, so I always leave satisfied. The waitresses here are very kind, helpful, and smiley. One of them even helped me with my korean, which I greatly appreciated. I highly recommend you try this place out!"
1,"They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness."
1,"Unbelievably amazing. The food was phenomenal. Had a nice table outside which set the ambiance. We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer - fabulous, we should have ordered two for the three of us.  The curry dish was amazing. I can't stress how tasty it was! We asked for it spicy and it def had a kick. There was a lot too so that I was able to really indulge.  The quinoa burger was ok.  We also ordered a butternut squash pizza. This had a unique flavor but we really liked it. I found the spiced apple drink to be too spiced for me but many yelpers really love it. I can't wait to eat here again."
0,"This place is a pit. I was a national delegate to the DNC from California. Most of our delegation was here. The day before we arrived, part of the facade fell off leaving 7 rooms uninhabitable   No room service, no room charges, terrible restaurant and bar. Breakfast each morning for the entire delegation tasted like plastic food. $310 a night for this\"" boutique hotel\"". Rip off. They installed a new computer system days before we arrived and many staff didn't know how to use it properly. One day people got stuck in the elevator for over an hour. My room wasn't cleaned 2 of the 5 days I was there. When I called housekeeping to complain, they either didn't answer the phone or promised to get it done. After three attempts I gave up.   My clock didn't work in the room, lamp didn't have a lightbulb, and the iron was broken. This hotel chain should be ashamed of what they did to the California delegation."
1,"I'm willing to bet that this place was a shining gem in its heyday.  Several days have passed since that day...leaving the same gem, minus a lot of the luster.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite spacious. It has a full bar to the left, a large recessed dining area in the middle (geared more towards groups), and a more secluded are to the right for smaller groups and/or couples. All three sections are quite spacious. \n\nWe happened to sit off to the right. We had a party of four and half (one three-year-old). The tables in this section were for a maximum of four people, and our daughter is FAR to tall for a high chair. Thankfully for us, where there are some bay windows facing out of the restaurant, there is a nice little padded booth created there, which turned out to be the PERFECT place for our daughter!\n\nThe menu for Serrano's is typical, but it's pretty limited. They offer the usual Mexican fare, usually in both chicken and beef (and ONE that offered shrimp). Both the quality and quantity of each dish we ordered was substantial. Suffice it to say that each member of our party left the restaurant with a take-home box.\n\nOur server was stellar. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so if he HAD been lacking, it would have made things very awkward. But, as it happened, Christian was phenomenal! He was patient with us while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive. He was very diligent with keeping our drinks full and our table cleared.\n\nBut, the coolest thing Christian did for us was regarding dessert. You see, it was my wife's birthday, and her parents wanted to go to this restaurant for a celebratory dinner. My wife was deathly afraid that the restaurant employees were going to make her wear a sombrero and sing a song to her...and Christian almost made that happen. However, when he could see the sheer terror behind my wife's eyes at the prospect of public humiliation, he took the clue, and offered to comp her dessert. \n\nThis shopping center that houses this restaurant is practically empty. There are \""For Lease\"" signs in several of the windows. I can see why this place has stood the test of time...though, I feel that their menu could use a little updating, which is the only reason I opted for four stars instead of five for this cozy little relic."
0,I just threw up the morning after we ate at Gordon Ramsey pub and grill I ordered the salmon which was the worst thing I have ever eaten in my life. The waiter never asked us how our food was and there is no condiments on the table not even salt honestly I want to puke right now thinking about it for someone who critiques food for a living critique your own food
1,"Pretty, pretty good.  This place is tucked away behind The Bentley Projects just south of downtown Phoenix.  You can't see it from the street, and there's not really anything around except some empty lots and the gallery; apparently you just need to be in the know ... and you want to be in the know.  Nice outdoor seating, not too crowded, and great food.  It's a lunch place, and the menu was mostly upscale salads and sandwiches (brie, goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, etc.).  I just stuck with the turkey club on focaccia, and it was mmm, good.  It also came with a white bean salad that was really good.  \n\nPlus, the dessert and drinks looked/were fantastic.  I really want to try the banana pudding and the frozen hot chocolate (which I tried to order, but I think the waitress said they were out of chocolate, what?).  They had a bunch of crazy-but-amazing-sounding lattes, cute mini-cakes (I had the carrot cake, which was good, but a little too much on the frosting; I could barely taste the cake), and super-good looking cookies (I bought a cute bunny rabbit sugar cookie for my friend, and it was sitting on my desk all afternoon, its little bunny eyes taunting me and daring me to bite off one of its bunny ears).\n\nDownsides -- The service was slow, the indoor seating didn't look too great (the music inside was yuck), and it's not exactly cheap (cookies were three dollars, mini-cakes were five, and I think the cheapest sandwich was nine bucks)."
0,"Men may be attracted to this place because the waitresses wear this tight lingerie looking outfits with black knee high boots.  I found that the place was as I expected: a place with mediocre food but nice decor, location, and (to men) nice looking uniforms.\n\nI had the clam chowder and it was surprisingly good.  It had lots of clam chunks in it and had just the right texture.\n\nThe tower of onion rings were also good.\n\nThis place prides itself on its burgers and has a wide selection of types of meat patties you can get (beef, chicken, turkey, veggie, lamb) or the type of bun you get.  Sides are a la carte, so if you want something with your burger, it will cost extra.  Most of the burgers come with one free topping, and extra toppings will also cost extra.  \n\nMy friend had the California Chicken Burger.  It was dry and it had no flavor.\n\nMy other friend had the buffalo wings.  She said they were too salty."
1,"Food Streats across from the El Cortez was amazing...so many people, live DJ's, cool booths and great food trucks. \n\nI had the Fuku Karai spicy burger and it was really good! Soft, spicy and yummy!! I also enjoyed the thick  fries...."

1,"I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done."
0,"So, I was all set to give this bar a solid four stars...\n\nThey feature live music quite a bit.  Been here once a few times recently.  The first seeing a band from Austin.  It's a solid, clean, neighborhood spot a half step above dive.  The drinks are good, and fairly priced.  They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\n\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.  All the sides were fairly good.\n\nThe food was an excellent value for the price point.  Checking out the menu we saw that their other, daily basis, menu items were at really reasonable prices as well\n\nJust a nice four star kinda bar, until after our visit last night.  Five housemates, two ate the burger.  Others had veggie burger, and the chili dog.  \n\nThe fries are pretty great.  Upon noticing the menu claimed the fries were baked, and not greasy, MrT asked why anyone would want them.  But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\n\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.  All set to give the Iron Post a solid four stars.\n\nUntil a few hours after we got home.  The burger dinner folks BOTH had food poisoning!\n\nOne of the food poisoned has stated since that her six week recovery from heart surgery was less painful than her case.  She ended up having to go to the hospital for it.\n\nSo, be warned.  Maybe stick with sides or veggie options here?  Don't know if I'd ever go meat here again!  \n\nI'd give the place another chance, steering(huhuh) clear of the meat.  I would give the bar more stars, but can't forgive the disgustingly, painfully stricken."
1,"I kinda live for cheese danish except when I am living for coffee. So, the new marriage between Grouchy John's and German Bread Bakery makes me very happy and twice as lively.  The cheese danish has the best pastry shell/wrap/? that I have tasted. The cheese is more than adequate, bordering on bountiful.  I like the apple danish, but it may need more apple. However, to be honest, even with double the apple, I'm going to pick the cheese. Go to get some cheese danish at GJ's, but not the last one, cause then I will be sad."
1,"I am so happy that people love Picazzo's  This restaurant has been a part of my life for the past 6 years.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the service, food and atmosphere!\n\nIf you are looking for a wonderful patio to meet your friends on for a drink-- look no further than Picazzo's in Tempe!!!!"
0,Man what happened this location has gone downhill in the past few months wheres the old crew that made this location special!!!!?????
1,So as we walk into this place I was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.\n\nSo let's start with appetizers we had the crab cakes which here they were your typical crab cakes nothing special but still tasted petty good.\n\nBone marrow!! I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!\n\nSo the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience\n\nOur cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\n\nAs for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\n\nSince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal.
0,"They obviously have good intentions here but there is just too much to complain about. Firstly, the interior decor is extremely drab and depressing.  Yeah, that's just my opinion, but I can't be the only one. Also, on a 75 degree day in Vegas, the temperature inside was way too hot. Even my wife who is never warm noticed it. The tables are too small, and the couches are creepy looking. We ordered smoothies and I swear they must have grown the fruit trees from scratch in order to make them, they took FOREVER to come out. They were good, though. We ordered the \""hummus delight\"" appetizer and even though the hummus was good, there wasn't enough of it to adequately eat it with the sides. My wife ordered the Greek salad and there was no feta cheese. What?!?!  That was a first and it made the salad so-so at best. I got the spicy beef panini and it was really good, but it looked as though they had some trouble with the panini press because it was a bit burnt and had pieces of other sandwiches on the bread.  \n\nSo, overall, the food was good but it took so looooong to get it out that it really marred the experience. Add that to the depressing decor and the high prices and I won't be back."
0,"I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."
1,Great selection of toppings and yogurt! Super clean friendly atmosphere the only place I will get yogurt from.  Do yourself a favor and go get some!
1,"Having stayed at there other property The Venetian I was anxious to try The Palazzo.\nSince is newer the Venetian is seem cleaner and more modern.\nGreat rooms\nThe casino is a little smaller.\nThe staff is fantastic.\nBeautiful decor throughout The hotel, check in was a breeze.\nI had such a good trip I stayed there again two weeks later and also had a great time."
0,"I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return."
0,"WARNING! For the well being of one's sanity and mental health DO NOT RENT from this company. Terri White the Corporate broker/Manger has no professionalism and is a completely rude. A one year old has more integrity and manners than Terri and her whole team. I wonder if the commissioner of  Reality knows that the only place Terri deserves to manger is her ass. This company is a JOKE! I hope 2015 will the end of the company and its unprofessional ways. I wish I could make a BIG YELP sign stating to visit this website first before dealing business with them. Horrible, Horrible company!"
0,"Probably the worst customer service in the world. The owner is always angry and he act like he's doing you a favor by taking your money. The pizza is usually super greasy but I don't even want to talk about the food, I just can't believe how rude this guy is. He never ever says thank you or anything at all other than \""what do you want\"" and the price. I think he's Albanian (judging by the flag on the walk) he does some dirty business in the back. My brother and I noticed few times some guys going in the back with duffle bags and leaving after like 5-10 minutes with different bags. There is something dirty going on here I guarantee it, I think they are using this business as a smoke screen for money laundering. I will never go there again for as long as I live!!!!"
0,"I would give them a good review because their food really is good.... When they get it right. I have come here multiple times with my boyfriend and they have gotten the order incorrect at least twice.\n\nI am a vegetarian and have only had restaurants give me meat in my food probably 4 times in the past 6 years. As I took a bite into my potato manchego cheese tacos I distinctly tasted chicken. I waited 20 minutes to get the incorrect item that simply needs to be fried. Like I said before, I would go back if they could pay attention to the order."
1,Oh my goodness! This place is amazing!\nIt's like a subway but with pizza.\nIt's a cute place with very nice and friendly staff.
1,"This review is for the bar area.  \n\nOn a trip to Vegas November 2010, Hubs and I stayed at Mandalay, so we tried a plethora of their restaurants. I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.\n\nOur bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately. I have always wanted to have dinner there but I will wait until things improve."
1,"My first ever Five Guys experience was at this location. The staff was quick, friendly and efficient. They had customer service down to a science. the food was great and the drink stations never lacked in anything.\n\n The only problem was with the seating...it was hard to move your chair and not accidentally bump into somebody else. But I think it was because I visited this place on a weekend."
0,"I'm really sad to say this was a major FAIL for me.  We came around 5:30pm on a Saturday night.  No one was in the restaurant.  There were 2 employees working, one cashier and one \""cook\"".  We ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an orange chicken bowl.  Also, the rumba fries.  I had a groupon so I paid 8.00 for 16.00 worth of food.  I had to pay 3 more dollars.  It took FOREVAH!! for the food to be served to me.  The salad was big, tons of lettuce and not that much chicken.  My spouse was served a teriyaki chicken bowl.  I said \"" this isn't what I ordered\"".  The cook said \"" Yes it is\"" and  I said \"" Nope, its not\"".  Spouse said she would just eat it.  After one bite, she says \"" taste this chicken\"".  I tasted it and it didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like pork.  I brought it back and said that I wanted what I originally ordered.  \n\nThat took another 10-15 min.  By this point, 6 other customers came in the the \""cook\"" was overwhelmed.  Ridiculous.   My spouse got her frozen, reheated chicken nuggets, drizzled with orange sauce and canned mandarin oranges.  She barely touched it and the overcooked fries.  No Thanks Rumbi Grill.  Wont be back."
1,"Great atmosphere in this place. Had a huge booth overlooking the bar. Had the prime rib, and was happy with it. Good place, a little pricey, but you already knew that."
0,"Prices have changed a bit since Vanessa P's 2013 posting.\n1 8x10 = $10.00\n2 5x7 = $10.00\nSeems each sheet (regardless of the portrait size) has been reduced to $10.00\n\nRegardless, I believe the pictures are still expensive.  It would be 'considerate' if some savings were passed on to the parents since Bartolo is reaping studio prices for bulk services.  Package prices and extra prints are comparable to Sears/JC Penny or the other professional photographers located in the Mall.  (At least the other photographers provide a variety of poses)."
0,im just confused on what the hell this place is trying to be..it looks all cool and modern on the outside..but the menu has low end sandwiches and then high priced steaks? The atmosphere inside is that of a fancy restaurant but it seems like an overdone chili's or applebees. The couscous was decent and their bread pudding is what made me give it the second star since it was made with croissants
0,"I would Not recommend this place. the ribs were dry and rubbery, and tasted like the rear end of  animal. They gloppes the sauce over to cover bad meat taste.  The beans were also old and glazed over like they had been reheated from last week.  The side salad I got was just iceberg lettuce with two slices of cucumber and tomato.  The best part of the meal were the dinner rolls and the balsamic vinegarette for the salad. All this was grossly over priced. If you want good bbq go to Road Kill Grill instead!"
0,"First the good - My wife had the Moo Shoo Chicken which was very good and the portion was quite large. The rice was good.\n\nI had the Spicy Chicken Dice - It was garbage. Inedible garbage. It was tiny pieces of dry popcorn chicken tossed in a huge plate of dried red chili peppers and it tasted like a large amount of white pepper thrown in for good measure - Completely dry, hot, and unpleasant. I usually like very hot food but this was just dry and awful. When the waitress asked how everything was, I told her I did not like the Spicy Chicken Dice. She made some sort of comment like \""it's a Chinese recipe\"".\n\nI'll make you a deal, Miu's - Have your \""chef\"" prepare the same meal the same way you did for me. Have either the chef or waitress eat half of it with me watching. If they do, I will remove my negative comments."
1,"This place is a breath of fresh air in downtown mesa that is saturated by subs and Mexican food. This place is clean, not to expensive ( good lunch deals), and just something totally new. The hamburger and slow cooked pork is heaven. I don't usually eat dessert but the fig, mascarpone, and caramel is a home run that would even impress Babe Ruth. If you're in the area, try it!"
1,"My husband and I were totally impressed by the dining experience. Everything, from good quality, presentation to service are top notch. This is our first time dining at a Michelin 3 star restaurant and Joel Robuchon definitely lives up to its reputation."
1,"A bright, pleasant breakfast spot close to our hotel.  We ate here several times during our 2 weeks in Brossard.  Come hungry.  They certainly fill your plate.  Crepes, waffles, pancakes, omelets, blintzes, they have it all.  They serve free coffee with your meals and always make sure it's topped off.\n\nThe weekday staff speak very little English.  However, a hostess and other staff show up for the weekend morning rush, most of which are competent English speakers.  Either way, we had no problem making understood what we wanted.\n\nCan't account for the other negative reviews.  Maybe the people up here have higher standards than what I'm used to back in the States."
0,I love starbucks and i love coffee but here my caramel macchiato shot was burnt and bitter the two times I have been here. So far the only Starbucks that screwed up my drink. I rather just go down the road and find another one a few blocks away.
1,"If you like New York style pizza this place is a hidden gem in Downtown...Located across from the court house on Lewis & Casino Center, they are one of the best I have found in town.\n\nThey are open Monday through Friday only from 7am to 6pm, but if you can make it downtown during the week, this is a place to check out.  Parking is a bit of a challenge as there is no free public parking lot, but I tell you it is worth the trip.\n\nThey have lunch special's which run daily until 4pm which means 2 large cheese slices with a drink is only $5.50 until 4pm.\n\nEveryone I have talked to during my visit today has told me everything they have is excellent.  You won't find a bad item on the menu and Anthony is a very cool person to hang and chat with.  \n\nI highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed..."
0,*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand
0,"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\n\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\n\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\n\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\n\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\n\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\n\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\n\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \""retouched photos\"" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\n\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job."
0,"I would like to give Karsh's 4 stars and here are the reasons why.  If you want kosher, they have it.  If you'd like to have sugar free, they have a nice variety, provided you go in early in the day.  They actually have quite a nice variety-a little something for everybody-and they do take orders.\n\nSound's good doesn't it.  What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.  The result is for the most part I tend to avoid the place.  Scott's Generations, the deli a few doors down, is more appreciative of your business.  I'll spend my money there.  Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.\n\nIf you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   \n\nAnother reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.  I'll face the craziness those lanes cause to go to the Bashas and Scott's Generation but not  Karsh's.  \n\nIt's rather sad to have to write a review like this."
1,"Legit Indian food right here!!!!\n\nLocated on West Craig and the 95, inside a tiny strip mall opposite the gas station. If you blink you'll miss it.\n\nLegitimate indian food is hard to find in Las Vegas and if you do find half decent food it's usually some sort of infused restaurant that costs an arm and a leg that's not very good!!!!\n\nAfter realizing Saffrons was closer than expected, I decided to give it a shot and wasn't disappointed!!!! Every time I have been here for lunch Buffet, dinner or picking up, the quality and standards of this business are 5 stars each and every time.\n\n My recommendations are the Rogan Ghosht, Lamb Vindaloo and the garlic Naan are all top shelf. The bar at the front of house is also not a bad little bar, with large LCD screen with whatever sport you want. Also it's a nice place  to knock back a kingfisher while waiting for friends. The service is also a fairly oiled machine. \n\nDecor is fairly simple and nothing outlandish that you come to expect from a lot of good five star places on the strip. \n\nI realize I'm pumping this business up, and I truly do believe its a 5 star indian restaurant. Indian restaurants are one of those hit or miss kinda places that can give you amazing quality or cardboard.... So until they start to pump out run of the mill stuff I'll keep it at 5 stars.\n\nOverall \nPrice: $$$ out of 5\nCleanliness: 4-5\nDrink: 3-5 basic bar\nFood: 5-5\nService: 5-5"
1,"Clean, very tasty, and I love the creativity in the dishes.  Well worth the price and I recommend trying different dishes because with each new dish I try I have not been disappointed."
0,I will never bring my stuff here again!! They send their stuff out to clean so they TAKE NO REPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CLOTHES.  If you care about the things you buy I would go somewhere else
0,"Sadly, Beso LOOKS better than it really is. The place is beautiful with its Swavorski chandeliers, views of the Aria waterfall at the entrance and dark, classy interiors. But once you take all that in, there's not much else to ooh and aah about. \n \nThe service at first was great. We were seated right away, to find the rest of our party already seated. At first, our server and his 2-3 other helpers were very attentive - water was poured right away, drink, appetizer and entree orders taken promptly. Our server was very friendly, ready with suggestions on drinks and appetizers. When we had questions about entrees, he was very knowledgable and seemed to give his honest opinions.\n\nThe drinks, bread and apps came and was actually great. We shared the ceviche, the guacamole and the crab cake. All were delicious. The strawbellini, I heard, was yummy. And the mojito was ok. \n\nAnd then came the wait. And so we waited and waited. About 30-40 minutes between clearing the appetizer plates and entrees coming. And during the waiting, not even one visit from the server or host or busboy to ask if we needed more water or to give us an update on dinner. We started to wonder if everyone assigned to our table went on break or went home for the night. \n\nFinally, entrees came. I had the paella which was just ok. The rice was not cooked evenly, some parts were undercooked and some parts were mushy. I probably wouldn't order it again. My husband had the ribeye, which compared to some of the other steakhouses in town, was disappointing. Flavors on both dishes just weren't there. The mac and cheese, which the server raved about, was on the bland side. Again, not very flavorful. \n\nOverall, Beso would be a great place to go for drinks. The vibe at the bar is fun, energetic and loud. But if you're looking for good food, you might have better luck elsewhere."
1,"I was a sushi virgin and based on the reviews this was probably the wrong place to pop my cherry.  But I did and it was simply alright.  I had the california rolls which were edible and I ate the entire thing.  I smothered them in soy sauce and focused on the rice.   The only problem was it was really dark and I thought the dollop of wasabi was a stray slice of avocado so my first bite was an entire mouthful of wasabi which made me nearly double over in mouth-searing agony.  I flailed frantically until I found my beer which I promptly inhaled as a means of quenching the tartar-esque inferno raging in my mouth. \n\nAfter I quenched it, I managed to choke down the rest of the rice, avocado and partially uncooked fish.  The sum of my experience is the unshakable notion that people don't really like sushi.  It's not as good as real fish and it's dangerous and more than a little creepy.  I think this is one of those foods you pretend to like in order to seem cool.  But, hey, I'm just a burger guy.\n\nThe service was great, my waittress pleasant and the vibe pretty cool for a cheesey college scene.  Plus the Sunday happy hour is very reasonably priced."
1,"I'm writing this review as I am about to embark on another LV journey with the girls.. A bit ago, me & j went on a LV trip- first time going with an other without a group of my girls (was sad they werent there!)\n\nTruth is, I dont really know how to gamble. I hate buffets. So for a person like me, i go to Vegas for the lavish hotels, morning mojitos, the tricked out pools, and the like. Encore provided just that. Anyone that has walked through Encore knows that the colorful interior with the mosaic tiles and slightly asian inspired (subtle) decor makes for sophisticated without crossing the line over to gaudiness.\n\nThe spa lounge area (can see it when one is crossing over to the XS pool area) is soo pristine- i wished my gfs to be there- they would have gotten excited about it more than J! The pool itself has two sections. One is directly connected to the spa and on the other side is the European style \""xs pool\"" - although we didnt see more than 3 brazen topless women, it was a big area for sunning and playing blackjack (same area they do at nighttime at the club)\n\n\nAs for the rooms, we had requested a \""quiet suite\"" since Encore is known to have loud music coming from XS at 4 in the morning.. so we got a north facing room.. Not the greatest view (just small strip plaza) but the King Suite (which is the smallest room at Encore I believe) was pretty spacious for 2 people.\n\nAnother thing- I dont know if anyone else notices but the music they constantly play in the casino is by Kaskade. I've heard at least 3 Kaskade songs during this stay and I remember hearing her 3 years ago when i was in this hotel as well- and i actually went home to look up who this artist was- and has made a permanent spot on my ipod playlist. For those that know of this artists work, it adds a serene element to the casino.\n\nOne of the only negatives to Encore/Wynn properties.. they are so damn far from everything else! We spent most of the trip at this hotel (except for the dinner/show which we cabbed to Bellagio- but the cab driver insisted taking some freeway looking road to get from Encore to Bellagio due to traffic ??)\n\nThey sometimes send deals over- one that i got in the mail which was 3 nights for 300 (incl weekends)- Except J threw it away and we didnt get to use it! So if you get one in the mail, take the offer! This place will be worth your stay."
1,"Very, very good food here.  Get the short ribs if they have them. \n\nDesserts are unbelievable as well...would be a good place to go just for that!\n\nThe short-ribs are served with a cherry BBQ sauce that is unbelievable.  I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.  I've also catered an event here before for a large group and it was awesome.  The menu can change often though based on the chef's desires/etc.\n\nI've been here twice and never left disappointed at all.  It would be a more frequented place if I lived closer to Scottsdale."
1,"Had to take up temporary residence here after a flood disaster at our home. The two bedroom suite with a kitchen was perfect for my husband and I, two young children and Grandma (who was visiting from out of town). The rooms were clean and well kept, and the free breakfast was much better than your average run of the mill cereal bar. The pool and jacuzzi were relaxing and clean, and the lobby staff always greeted us with a bright smile. I would highly recommend this hotel."
1,"Had to give these guys another thumbs-up !\n\n I stopped in today for breakfast to find a deal on Pumpkin Pancakes with walnuts and cranberry syrup. ! \n\nWow what a combination huh ? \n\nLet me tell ya , they were GREAT. My breakfast with coffee totaled less than $10.00 and I was full for the whole day.\n\n\n\nYou cannot be disappointed here , Breakfast , lunch or dinner. Fast friendly staff excellent service.\n\nGreat Job Guys , Keep up the good ..... Great Job."
0,"Cafepino takes every opportunity possible to inflate your bill.  Our server asked us if we would like bread brought to to the table and then added $2.50 to our bill for it.  The specials were read to us.  I ordered the salad that was on special that was described as, \""Mixed greens topped with  warm grilled seasonal vegetable and chicken breast.  Imagine my shock when I received the bill and was charged $19.50 for salad!!  I was billed $15.00 for salad and an additional $4.50 for the chicken!   I went in for a quick bite with my two kids before a movie and ended up with a $75 bill!!!  Will never go back."

0,"Sunday on April, 13-14. I went to a high limit baccarat room at about 3-7:15am, (4+ hours of play). Then I \""color up\"" chips. Within 4 hours I had \""color up\"" chips. total $10,750 chips. I was tired and did not cash out then went back hotel room to rest up. That afternoon (Sunday the 13th of April). I went to a different Casino called Wynn Casino to watch a show. Before the show started in that Casino. I asked the dealer if I can play the chips that I used in the other Casino because I didn't have cash in my pocket. The dealer said I could cash out. The dealer also said to me that I need to go to the cashier to cash out. I went to the cashier and ask for sure if they accept these chips. The cashier said they accept these chips from Aria Casino. The cashier called by phone to Aria Casino to verify the chips for about a 15 minutes. After the phone call, the cashier told me to go back to Aria Casino to cash out. The cashier offered me to cash out my two $25 chips here. I told them I didn't want to cash it here. The next day at 8 pm ( Monday, April, 14-14). I went back to where I stayed at (Aria Casino) to cash out from the chips I played before. Some manager told me that I cannot cash out with these chips. I asked why I couldn't cash out. In reply, the manager told me that I couldn't cash out because that manager said that he did not see me play at Aria that Sunday morning. I called my friends that I went playing that Sunday morning to give that proof that I did play. My friend came and talk to the manager and still didn't believe it and told me that I still couldn't cash out. Then another manager Jennifer came up to fine out what's going on. She asked if I had tried to cash out at the Wynn Casino Sunday night. I told her yes, she was very upset when she asked me that. Jennifer told me that she saw me buy chip about 1-2 grand to play, but didn't see me \""color up\"" Jennifer asked if I remember if I had  \""color up\"" at that time. I said that I didn't remember. I straight up told her that I played 4 hours which is from 3am -7:15am and asked her to check the cameras from around that time I gave her. At first she said that she won't check the cameras. Jennifer asked if I remember the time I play, then she will check the cameras. So my friends was also with me and help me try to remember really hard what time I had \""color up\"". I told her Jennifer that  about 4-5 in the morning I had \""color up\"". Jennifer went to check, but she still didn't see me play there. Jennifer asked me one last time to really remember what time I had \""color up\"" or she won't check anymore. So  I asked Jennifer since I can't cash out anymore can I still use these chips to play. In reply, Jennifer said I still use these chips, but cannot cash out. So I went back to my room with my friends to really remember what time I had \""color up\"" because again she told us to really remember one last time or she won't check anymore. My friends and I really try to remember, but nothing came out of out minds to what time I had \""color up\"". Then I called all my friends to tell them about my story. After I talk with all my friends. We went back to the cashier and try to cash out again. The cashier called the manager Jennifer. Jennifer asked me why did all of  my friends went with me and came all at once this time because it's all going to be the same story. My friends asked Jennifer if these are the chips are actually from this Casino and she approved that these chips are from this Casino, Aria. Jennifer keep saying that she still didn't see me play. My friends asked Jennifer  to check the cameras to see if I did play which she says it may take about 4 hours. She asked to give her some time to take a look at the cameras. I agree to give her time to take a look at it over. After at about 4 hours period of time she called me and say that she still didn't see me play. So now all I can think of is to call the police. At about 2:30am, I use the phone at the hotel where I stayed to call the police. Security of the Aria hotel came instead of the police. I ask the security why did they came instead of the police. The security asked if anything is wrong. So anyways I told them same story. I said that if this problem cannot be solve then I will just have to call the police and the news to tell them my story. The security took photos of all of my chips, myself and my friends for evidence. Security asked that if they can cash out my chips, then will I still call the police and the news. I reply, if security can cash out my chips then I will not call. The security asked me to give them an hour to solve this problem then they will call me back. About 1 hour later there's another person called me to ask me to come down to the cashier to cash out. I'm really angry and frustrated about all this happening at this Casino. I can't imagine what kind of Casino this big would do something like this. I've gambled at other different Casinos for years, but never seen a Casino like this."
0,"We visited this Sunday afternoon. There were three other pairs there and one person on the internet. The lattes were good. There were still a few pastries, but very little bread available. We wanted a sourdough, but no luck."
0,"Just terrible.  Crappy service, unfriendly waiters.  We had to ask five times for more shrimp.  We got the 2 for 1 coupons and they tried to charge us full price anyways, then took forever to come back with the bill.  We waited over 20 minutes to get our bill back with the correct total before we could leave.  The restaurant is dirty, and clearly not cared for very well.  I should have known better than to take a deal from the street guys, when in Vegas, spend like you're in Vegas and go somewhere that knows how to treat you."
0,"Customer beware; I have just learned one of the most rip off and stupid rule that Bank of America is using for crediting refund. On 3/16 I used my debit card to pay for my prescriptions. I knew before hand that it was going to cost quite a bit of money. The clerk charged my account for 1,200 dollars which was the mistake. She immediately electronically refunded the money to my account. I did not pay any attention to my balance thinking that the refund would went back in to my account immediately. This morning 3/19 I received an alert telling me that my fund is below my set limit. I immediately logged into my account ; I found the charge and did not see the credit. I called Boca customer service she told me it is their rule that the refund would not be credit back for 5 days. I complained that they took my fund immediately but yet 15 minutes after noticed the mistake the credit was made; I have to wait for 5 days it does not make sense. \""Well this is the rule. \""; she replied. You be the judge is this a rip off practice and a stupid rule or what?"

0,"Fast-service BBQ places abound in just about every town and city, and they all deliver pretty much the same menu: BBQ brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sometimes ribs and burgers.  Tom's is the same.  Usually the ambiance is booths and plain tables-and-chairs.  Often you order at a counter and they bring you the food.  Tom's is the same.  Prices are usually a bit more than fast food but not as much as regular sit-down restaurants.  You guessed it - Tom's is the same.\n\nBut this Tom's has a problem.  Consider the brisket platter for about $10, which consists of brisket, a biscut, and a side.  What could be so bad?  Well, it was the brisket.  The portion consisted of about 3 ounces (maybe 4) of meat utterly covered in a sweet BBQ sauce -- not cooked with the sauce, just inundated with it.  Ok - scrape it off, you will suggest.  So I did.  What was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket.  Half of my small portion of meat was fat, and not crispy tasty fat but soggy discouraging muck.  The pictures on the wall showed lots of lean slices from the first cut of the brisket -- misleading? or downright fraudulent?  Now I see why they put 6 ounces of BBQ sauce on 3 ounces of meat.\n\nI notice that the rest of our group of six was eating their food, mostly, but without any outward signs of real pleasure.  That at least was comforting - misery loves company."
1,"I like Cibo better than Bianco as a restaurant, but Chris's pie is still better by a nose. Cibo has bad parking, nice ambience, spotty service, good menu, fresh, high quality ingredients, and good value. Translates to hit the off hours, get a pie, order the antipasto, and have a Nutella desert"
0,The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
1,"My husband and I decided to have dinner at Station Square and afterwards, just kind of stroll around.  We decided on going to Sesame Inn, which is one of Pittsburgh's most popular Chinese restaurants--and with good reason.  The food here is typical Chinese-American fare, but it is very tasty and a good value.\n\nIf you read my reviews of other Chinese restaurants, you'll know that I love just the basics.  Oh, sure, I like to try something new once in awhile, but on the night we went, I wanted something familiar and yummy.  I opted for the shrimp with vegetables.  The shrimp was good and tender, the vegetables nice and crisp, and the white sauce not overpowering--just the way I like it.  Rick opted for Sea Scallops with Ma La Sauce, which kind of surprised me.  He rarely has seafood out.  I tasted the scallops, but they were a little too spicy for me.\n\nWhile we love the eggrolls here, they are the melt-in-your-mouth type, we opted for something a little different this time.  We had the fried dumplings for an appetizer.  They were not at all greasy or heavy.  Rick has also eaten the boiled dumplings, saying they are delicious.\n\nAs I  said, this place is the perfect blend of good food, good value, and a great location."
0,"We went with our kids last Friday for her birthday as she is a candy fanatic and even made reservations and let them know it was her birthday.  We were sorta hoping they would at least acknowledge the occasion but nope, just another table to handle.\n\nAfter getting water served, we had to wait 15 min for our server to take our order.  Then when he did, he didn't take drink orders and we had to track him down to order those.\n\nFood took about 20 min to serve and was ok.  I would put it in the same category as Cheesecake Factory but half the portion size. Nothing very special to make it stand out or special garnishments like candy to make it pop!\n\nNow I know it's the strip, but $15 for a burger or $18 for average pasta is a bit steep.  And $8 for a beer is too much.  Maybe just me.  The hardest one is the $36 specialty cocktail. Are you crazy?  Entire check for 7 was $250 and we didn't even order some of the more expensive items on the menu.  Apparently they forgot we've been in a recession.\n\nThe one saving grace is that the desserts (2) were very tasty.  \n\nBack to the reason we were there, they didn't even offer a lollipop or nada for my daughter's birthday.\n\nToo many good places in town to go to,this wasn't one of them.  Given the options on the strip, I would stop off in the store and buy some candy, but eat somewhere that is a real restaurant where they focus on the guest and not the novelty of the theme."
1,"There was 7 of us and we wanted a table to sit down in the back and they told us it was going to be a 40 minute wait. I didn't understand why the told us that time frame because more than half of the tables in the back were empty. That annoyed me a bit, but when we finally sat down to eat it made up for the weird part.\n\nThe burgers were delicious. Large portions, came with fries, and I wasn't able to finish my meal. Even so, I still ordered one of their alcoholic milkshakes, the chunky monkey...? The shake was really good too. I wasn't expecting them to give the metal cup where the shake was blended in and usually where half the shake was in too, but they did. the alcohol was very subtle and it tasted amazing. I was extremely happy at the end of the meal."
0,"I arrived at Urban Tap in time to have a drink ahead of closing time, meeting a group of 4 girls that were already there.  The bartenders were kind enough to confirm that I had ample time to buy one round of drinks before leaving for the night.\n\nWhat followed was behavior, by the owners no less, that was so abhorrent that I never intend to patronize this place again.  2-3 minutes after spending over $50 on a final round of drinks, someone yelled at me to \""Get the f*ck out of the bar.\""  I looked over at a table of 5 guys that were now purporting to be the owners of the bar.  They were literally yelling at me (for no apparent reason) to leave and they began to use words such as, but not limited to, \""Faggot\"" and \""Asshole\"" while one man with a beard began to comment on my clothes and hair.  They went as far as to be rude to the girls in my group as well -- again, for no apparent reason.  I'll point out that these men all seemed to be under the influence of a lot of alcohol and drugs, as well.\n\nRather than have things escalate, we took the high road and left.  On the way out, the staff was kind enough to confirm that these \""gentlemen\"" actually did own the bar.\n\nThis will all feel worthwhile if even one person opts to not patronize this establishment as a result of this review.  The people that own this place should absolutely be ashamed of themselves."
0,"Wow...where to begin with this place?  I call up the night of going there to see if a reservation was needed.  They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening.  They do...Great!!  I head over to Sutra which is the \""new\"" sushi place to go to in scottsdale.  Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation??  The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge.  There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing.  I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity.  They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi.  The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!!  Im talking painful to sit through.  The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks.  We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list.  She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus.  Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them.  Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted.  After she looked it over she asks, \"":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??\""  We all looked at each other and said, \""No, whats the deal here tonight?'  She says, \""We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available.  Hmmm....\""Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation\"" I pondered.  And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter.  Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted.  Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order.  As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting.  The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt.  She was asking US what still needed to come out.  Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out??  So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore.  We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet.  She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, \""Oh, you guys didnt get everything?\""  She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour.  \""About what\"" you are wondering.  I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done.  So, I think you get the idea.  This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long.  This was a painful dining experience.  Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes.  This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up!  SUCKED...Dont go!"
0,"First off let me say this, if you want authentic French cousine... go elsewhere this isn't anything close to resembling real french cuisine.\n\nThat being said, we went here for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming and quaint.  The waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The food... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i have expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence chef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever go there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree was overcooked and underwhelming.\n\nThey should consider hiring a chef who is familiar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint."
1,"I love, love, love me some  Oregano's and I'm so glad I live just a few miles away. Their salads, their sandwiches, appetizers, pizzas and pizookie dessert are all amazing. Serious grub, very affordable, huge portions, a fun atmosphere, super friendly wait staff...this place has it all.\n\nThe only negative I have ever had is just a personal preference. If you are in a mellow mood or looking for something more romantic on a date night, this isn't the spot. It's LOUD and pretty cramped full of tables, people and antique 'stuff.' Fun if you are in a social mood and don't mind your personal space being invaded often."
1,Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!
1,"Had taken my car to Redddy and Ryan fixed my Nissan. It had to go back as it was jumping. Reddy said leave it with me let me check it out. They got me a rental car and got me a discount on it, and then took off discount for me renting a car. That was so nice , the rental place tried to TACK on high fees However Reddy Mom.. cute an d sweet as she is.. called them and GOT my discounted RG Motorworks Rate back as it should have been as RG said. That was Awesome.. I love this shop just wished they were closer. :) however well worth the drive and price was so reasonable,  then in talking to Reddy's mom, found they were from same City and state, Shout out to San jose...."
0,"I had read good things about this place, so I was excited to try it.  Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and split pea soup.  The food took forever to arrive.  When it finally got there, my grilled cheese was missing the tomato, and the cheese was not completely melted.  I ate it as-is, since I didn't have the time to wait for a new sandwich.  I subsequently opened the ketchup bottle which somehow exploded shooting ketchup all over the table and my clothes.  Not a great start.  The pea soup was ok, but there were too many croutons in it and not enough peas.  After finishing our lunch, we waited at the table for an incredibly long time and never got our check.  We decided to go stand at the cash register to see if that would help.  The staff completely ignored us for about 5 minutes before someone finally came to the cash register (not a big place, they saw us waiting).  The lady at the cash register did explain that they usually were not that busy, but for us it was too little, too late.  There is no second chance to make a first impression: I'm not going back."
1,"Awesome time with the family. I mean the tequilla didn't hurt, but it was good food, good music and live entertainment.  Mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit.  Kinda pricey though."
1,"I'm confused as to why this place doesn't get better reviews from Yelpers.  I travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year.  We usually stay here when our time share allows.  This time, there was no availability, so we paid out of pocket...and still feel it was worth it.\n\nAs already noted by other yelpers, the great qualities about this hotel are the location, convenience of the kitchen, friendliness of staff, available parking, strong wifi in room (particularly 2nd and 3rd floor)...I'm not sure what else to add.  Toiletries are bath and body works, good pressure and instant warm water in the shower, thick towels...It's great that they provide a small vacuum cleaner in the closet so you're not reliant on housekeeping.  I can't really think of any cons that are really the hotel's fault.  So LV Blvd and Koval, which are the two main roads that border the hotel are made congested.  LV at almost all times, and Koval during peak hours.  Another con is no airport shuttle.  But I usually have a car when I visit LAS.\n\nI think the price of $120 a night (incl taxes and fees) is reasonable.  It's not the cheapest even on the Strip (Circus Circus, Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood, and Imperial Palace are a few I know that are cheaper...but I wouldn't want to stay at any of them).\n\nFinal note, one yelper's review suggested that it was a con that this was not an actual casino hotel.  In Vegas you can gamble at convenience stores, grocers, and even right before you leave at the airport.  If not having a casino immediately accessible first thing when you crawl out of bed makes your palms itch...then you might have a problem;)"
0,"Ok...So here's the deal. You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world.  I feel horrible doing this, but I mean come on! Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food).  But what got me more then the horrible food, was the service.  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone, Than It took another 10 for her to come out.  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table.  The food was cold, service was slow, and it was not worth the money.  I vow to never go there again! There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place."
1,Amazing! Short rib tacos were some of the best I've had. Lunch wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Service was excellent.
1,"Venue:   NASCAR Hall of Fame\n\nDecor:   Nice, Clean, \n\nService:   Friendly\n\nEnvironment:   Entertaining, Informational\n\nFood:   N/A\n\nPrices:  Fair\n \nHuge Pros:  Located centrally in the Heart of the City, relatively newer facility\n\nDebbie Downers:  \n \nConclusion:   It is something everyone should check out as a tourist.  You don't need to be a fan of NASCAR to enjoy this experience.  Definitely give it a go to put it under your belt for the different exhibits and activities it has.\n\nOverall: Whether you are a huge fan of NASCAR or just a casual fan, this is a tremendous venue with much to see.  It could have been located in a better Southern City \n\nGrade: B"
0,Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back.
1,I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.
1,"Well executed training - in just shy of 4 hours I earned my CPR, First aid and AED certificate.  Kari brought in real world anecdotes to supplement the videos.  Training equipment was excellent.  Only negative is the run down strip mall where the business is located - I was a bit concerned walking to my car late at night, but I am also unfamiliar with the area.  I would returned for further training."
1,"After a night of clubbing at Tao, we made a pit stop here to satisfy our late night hunger. We got seated immediately and our seats were right by the entrance. I think my friend and I shared a bowl of BBQ Pork and Roast Duck Noodle Soup while the 6 of us shared Dim Sum (Har Gow and Siu Mai). Each Dim Sum came with 6 pieces each so it was perfect. They were very accommodating and the food was pretty good. When it came time to pay, my friend and I wanted to pay for the birthday girl's share. I wasn't provided a receipt after paying so I went to ask for one because the birthday girl kept asking (wondering why no one took her credit card). All in all, not bad for my first time here."
0,"My business partner and I are always all over the city and noticed the Native New Yorker sign was removed from the store and a banner for \""The Brickyard\"" was in its place. Figured we would stop in and check it out and drop off a card in case they were shopping for a new sign. The waitress was very nice, almost too nice and offered up more information about the business than I would want my employee too. Apparently the owners disengaged from the N.N.Y franchise, there are legal issues, she's the only waitress left with the changes, etc. The place looks exactly the same, but they now advertise $.36 cent wings on Tuesday, not $.35 cents. Apparently this is a N.N.Y thing and being they disenfranchised, can't advertise it. The waitress made sure to tell me \""they still only charge $.35 though\"". I ordered 20 wings and a soda, my business partner ordered the philly cheese steak and a soda. The place was pretty dead, but it took a good 20 minutes to get our orders. The wings were nothing special...lots of breading, sauce had little flavor. My biz partner said the same thing about his sandwich. After eating 12 of the 20 wings, I figured I would take them to go and asked for a box. I was responded to with a sign and a roll of the eyes from the waitress, who said \""I can't take them\"". She informed us that the wing price was for dine in orders only and that I HAD TO LEAVE THEM THERE!!! She said they lose money on the wings and expect people to order other things to help offset the loss. Sure, I could see if I came in and ordered 50 wings, ate one with a glass of water and left. We came in, ordered food, at there and ordered other stuff. The waitress made a huge scene and a lady at another table overheard the commotion and let me know she ordered wings too, but the waitress told her she needed to order a drink to get the wings for that price (which isn't noted on their window advertising at all). She made a point of sitting another couple next to us and telling them it was Tuesday wing day and you can only eat the wings there, no matter what else you order. What a joke. I told her if she would have said that to me before I ordered, I would have gotten one wing at a time and made her run back and forth to the kitchen. I also asked her what they would do with the wings I didn't eat if I didn't take them with me, she said they would throw them out. So apparently that's how they treat their customers. She said she was sick of the place because this happens all the time. I guess she should be a little more clear with the customers or this place needs to stop being so damn cheap. I won't be heading back to the Brickyard anytime soon. There's a Native New Yorker on 19th ave and Happy Valley that appreciates my business."
0,"This place was pretty bad. We got the nutella, fruits du mer, peanut butter & bananas, and the mixed berry crepes. The only one that was good was the peanut butter. I think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients. Would not go back."
1,"This place was very cool! They went all out for the battlefield theme. They had a wide and unique selection of firearms! I finally got to shoot the Tavor, Glock 18, and Chiappa Rhino!\n\nThe price is Vegas priced for shooting so expect to pay 400% the normal price of ammo... I would normally take off a star for that but seeing how all the other places around are the same I can't hold it against this place.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and professional! I happen to go during a slower time. I was in and out within 15 minutes, probably less than 5 minutes of actual shooting. That's what happens when you fire full auto guns.... I'd recommend this place over the other Vegas run ranges simple because their staff! Their weapon selection was a little better than thegunshop or discountguns. Prices were about the same. It's close to circus circus (across the street). Good place to take friends/relatives that are from overseas and can't fire guns in their own country."
1,Tried the corn chowder and it was divine. I especially loved the grated Vermont white cheddar on top!
1,"The atmosphere of this place has been totally transformed and opened up from what it was as La Paz. It is hard to imagine that it is even the same space. Elegant, but not too stuffy. I liked it.\n\nThe food was simply incredible. I mean really, really incredible. I have eaten at so many Italian joints, from kitschy to stuffy to authentic to unknown neighborhood spots to chain restaurants. But this place really takes the cake. Everything we had was phenomenal. Nothing even just \""OK.\"" We had the wood grilled octopus and goat cheese pomodoro. Both should not be missed, but the goat cheese was just ridiculously delicious. I had a wedge salad and my wife had a Caprese salad...both very near perfection. I had the Zuppa di mare, or seafood stew, and it was packed with calamari, scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, and white fish. I can't begin to tell you how much i enjoyed it. My wife had the Gorgonzola beef filet. She said it was only second to Del Frisco's, which is quite a compliment, especially for a non-steakhouse. We finished with a Nutella custard and Nutella filled doughnuts. God, it was so good.\n\nThe service was something I would expect at a much more expensive restaurant. Our server, Christopher, addressed every need and was just the right amount of cordial and friendly with us.\n\nPrices were very reasonable...especially for the quality. Most entrees were $15-$20 and topped out at $33. \n\nLiterally zero complaints from this place. Just a perfect evening we had there."
1,"This place is great!  Every time I'm in town, I go here for a few beers and a good time.  It's basically the Cheers of Pittsburgh...\n\nThis place used to be a really run-down, shady bar that was well-known for the rough characters that would frequent it.  It was shut down by the city (or maybe the previous owners left, who knows) and a new family - The Hough's - opened it back up after major renovations and improvements.\n\nI cannot say enough about the family who runs the place (Barb is amazing, so nice and a great smile!) and the bartenders (Kevin is the man!)  The beer selection is incredible...microbrews, Belgian ales, imports, seasonals, PA craft beers.  Likewise, the specials run every day but Sunday and are great.  They just recently changed their food menu so make sure to take a look at that.  The most I have ever ordered was the grilled cheese sandwich (AMAZING!) which comes with fries, but I have seen more complex dishes that looked rather good for a bar.  Better yet, the prices for food and drinks are all very reasonable, the bathrooms are clean and the place is very comfortable - no more hot, humid bars for me (one of the things I hate the most)!\n\nIf you're looking for a friendly, inexpensive and comfortable place to grab a few beers or maybe a bite to eat - this is definitely the place to go!  They even have a board where they post pictures of all the regulars - I mean, how much better can you get?\n\nPS - If you want to play darts, its super cheap, check them out too!"
1,"I ordered the porterhouse steak for 2 (32oz)for me and my gf which was $105. Honestly the best steak I ever had. I ordered it medium rare, and it was just melting in my mouth. Service was excellent and you cannot over dress here. If you have extra money for a nice elegant meal I would recommend."
0,"Tasty enchiladas, great salsa and flavorful beans but it ended up being a bit pricey for Mex fast food.  I ordered the 2 enchilada combo plate listed at $5.85, then added a soft drink and the bill ended up costing $9.50.  \n\nLooking at the receipt I see they charged $1.00 extra for having chicken - didn't see that listed on the menu and the cashier didn't tell me about it which was a bit of a surprise."
1,"Went for Sunday brunch. The food was sub-par. Good, but it's breakfast food, so hard to screw up. The service was outstanding. It was a slow morning, so we were able to get to the buffet with no problem. I had one of the made to order omelets, very good. Instead of waiting for it, they brought it down to us. Not sure if this is a usual practice, but it was appreciated. The bagel/croissant was dry. The bacon (from the looks of it), not super crispy. Although I don't eat meat, I have yet to know a person who doesn't like crispy bacon. Potatoes were really good- very impressed with use of the red pepper in them. (So underused an under appreciated by most restaurants). I would go back!"

0,"I was excited to try this place, but sadly i did not get a chance. They advertise that they deliver, but apparently only on busy days, don't know which day that is. Very disappointed."
1,I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones.
0,"Sam Nazarian is no Steve Wynn. Not even in the same hemisphere\n \nThis hotel is horrible. When we arrived the elevators at the parking garage were broken. Which is funny because \""management\"" replied to a review someone else posted saying this \""issue was resolved\"". Thats a BOLD LIE! We had to walk 5 flights of stairs up and down. (no joke) That was just the beginning. The shotty overspray of paint marks were everywhere. You could literally see where the paint sprayer stopped when painting the hotel white color. This hotel is lipstick on a pig. \nWe went to LIFE nightclub at around 10:45pm and literally were the first people in line down the very long hallway. Literally nobody (not one person) behind us. They made us wait over 20 mins for NO reason. when we walked in the place was empty. Ladies in their glittery dresses just standing around, the guys wearing matching chuck shoes with there hands behind their backs waiting for the night to be over so they could collect a paycheck, the dance floor not moving and people looking around like WTF is this?...... The detail was not good. Crooked tiles on the ground. (some missing grout) watered down OVERPRICED drinks ($16 for small bacardi-coke) DJ Pete Tong couldn't even keep the place alive. Tables start at $550. Half of them were still empty all the way through the night. \nFor a \""grand opening\"" night. It was a flop. The place started to get crowded around 12 midnight, then literally people started leaving at about 1:30 am in droves. The rumblings of disappointment were obvious. \nI think Sam Nazarian got a little too cocky buying this hotel (the old Sahara) The location is not good (far end of the strip). He depended too much on his 'LA brand\"" thinking he could just woddle into Las Vegas and \""make it happen\"". \nThe only thing good about this hotel is the restaurants, thats it. Nothing more. I was waiting for the paint to fall off and the wallpaper to come down with the Sahara hotel shining back through to life."
1,"I've lived here for 3 years and continue to call this my home.  Yes, there are noise issues, a less than ideal parking situation on some nights, and higher rent ...BUT, the reason I continue to call this place home is because it is so inspiring, rich and pleasing to the eyes to view and is straight up BEAUTIFUL!  I have met many good friends from this complex and expanded my contact list and network by living here.  I gave this review 4 stars because even though Optima is a beautiful place to live, there are a few things that make it just under 5 STAR.  Having said that, if you are looking to rent or purchase a condo or APT then this is the first place you better check out.  Everyone must live here for at least a year to understand the true beauty of the Optima.  I'm very excited and looking forward to the new Optima Sonoran Village to be completed, it's a similar complex that will be on the other side of Fashion Sqr mall."
1,"Excellent crepes!  Very high quality ingredients makes it worth the price.  I had a ham and gruyere crepe and it was very good - loved the crispy cheese on the edges of the crepe. The place is cute, the service staff were all very friendly. \n\n One thing though needs to be corrected.  When ordering my coffee (refills $0.75) I asked for milk.  I was handed a gallon jug of milk, the lid still screwed on.  I thought the girl was maybe being lazy but when I went back for a 2nd cup I was once again handed the gallon of milk.  Just wrong!"
1,The best local place to get beer.  It has the feeling of NODA. I have never seen a better selection of cold quality craft beers.
0,"Back in its heyday in the 1990s, Bagels Etc was a fantastic place.  Cheap, friendly, great food. Throw in the occasional Leonard Cohen sighting and it was my go to breakfast and brunch joint. \n\nSo, yeah, this place has been living on its reputation for quite some time. And the prices have gone up, the food has gone downhill, Lenny's out on tour, and the service.... well, the service is something truly special. My only guess is that it's been under new management for a while.  The service is truly atrocious and unpleasant.  Memories be damned: the last time I went is the last time I will go. \n\nThe wait was forever and there were empty tables everywhere. The servers didn't even bother looking up from their conversation to help us. We had to track down the manager to complain. And he didn't care. And - as already observed - the service makes inappropriate and offensive comments.  One a previous trip (my second to last), the server made some offhand joke about Parkinson's disease (she was jittery when bringing our coffee) when my friend at the table's father is suffering from that horrible disease. They are rude, inefficient and just plain awful. I guess if you like that kind of \""experience\"", Bagels Etc is the place for you. For everyone else, go elsewhere."
0,"On Easter weekend, we called Animal Inn regarding their rates.  They informed about their price but failed to tell us about an additional rate being that it's Easter.  They did however, remember to tell us that they close early on Easter Day.\n\nWe brought our Tibetan Spaniel there and she absolutely did not want to go in.  The workers are not friendly and/or accomodating at all.  Terrible service all the way around.  We asked them why they couldn't tell us that there were extra fees over the phone when we called and they just said \""well that's how it is\"".   We would be happy to pay the extra money, but not when they intentionally fail to tell us to accomodate their business.  \n\nUpon picking our dog up, no one greeted me as I entered the door, so I stood there waiting as they were all staring at me, until someone had the descency to acknowledge a customer.  They were rude, very unfriendly, and did not seem to care about the animals.  \n\nOur dog seemed a little traumatized after we brought her home to bathe and feed her.  \n\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"Has a some chairs out front so you can socialize under the hot summer sun. The employees are exceptionally friendly, particularly in the early hours of the morning when I typically grab a drink. Expect it to be moderately busy due to the location."
1,"I've had both breakfast and lunch here & it's pretty good.  Tasty food, reasonable prices (be sure to ask for 10% senior discount if that applies to you), and friendly servers who refill water as needed without asking and are good about getting special requests (non-cholesterol egg substitute, dry toast) correct.  The only thing that I don't like is that portion sizes seem to vary considerably from one visit to the next.  I usually order the same things, and my breakfast omelet and hash browns often fill a large platter, but on the next visit they barely take up 1/2 of a small platter.  Fries can be overflowing the lunch plate or look like just a handful & sandwiches are sometimes stuffed with meat and cheese and other times pretty skimpy-looking.  Overall, I like it, it's close by, parking is easy, and they seat people quickly, even when there is a crowd."
1,"This has been my best car buying experience. Johnie Lewis, the salesman, was easy to work with. I told him exactly what I wanted and he didn't try to sell something I didn't want or need. \n\nWhen it was to negotiate a price, I told what I wanted and how much I had to put down. They didn't try to give me a lease or a ridiculously low payment with a high amount of months to pay on like some other dealers tried to do. \n\nI have always liked the looks of Hondas but I never thought I would own due to dealership not wanting to negotiate a fair price. Findlay Honda has totally changed my mind and I am a Honda CR-V owner.\n\nAfter having my new CR-V for a week and a half, I had some questions about the blue tooth and navigation system. Johnnie set up an appointment for me to talk to Mick. He was so patient with me and answered all my questions. I have features on the car I didn't even know I had.\n\nI will definitely go back to use their Service Department.\n\nI am a happy new Honda owner."
0,"Subs so slow you'll starve before they get there. This location in particular is literally only two right turns right down Mineral Point Road (less than a mile on the same street!) to my workplace, yet it is always an average of 40 minutes before I get my delivery order. How is that even possible? I could walk there faster than that. I always have to remember to order my lunch well before I'm even hungry for it. If my work was in a weird location, I guess I could understand, but we're literally right down the street from them. \n\nI love that JJ has online ordering but this location has to step up their game. Their \""Subs so fast you'll freak\"" motto is a joke. If I could give this location less than one star, I would."
1,"My husband and were driving from Chicago to Madison for a concert and were looking for an inexpensive place to spend the night. Not only was the Ruby Marie the least expensive hotel within walking distance of the Majestic Theatre, but it had a charming atmosphere, everyone was friendly, and we got two complimentary drinks to the adjacent bar and two free breakfast entrees and beverages at the neighboring restaurant. Definitely the best deal in town. My only complaint was that the radiator was making loud rattling noises (if it wasn't the radiator, then it was something outside). However, I definitely plan to stay here again the next time we're in town."
1,"Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time."

1,"I was unsure if I really was going to be able to give this place 5 Stars.  Until my first bite.\n\nEarl is just hands down a great place to eat.\n\nOnly con is they only have a six inch sandwich, they really need at the very least 6\"" and 12\"" or 6\"" and 9\""\n\nI went with five other friends and our food came out quickly, hot, and everyone loved it.\n\nI am excited for their Downtown Disney Anaheim, CA location opening soon."
0,"This is for the nikki cafe by the pool...not the restaurant.\n\nWas chilling by the pool earlier today. Walked up to the bar or whatever that was for some drinks and food. A man behind the counter handed me a menu and was told to wait for the cocktail waitress.\n\nI go back to my tanning spot, and my friends an I wait.\n\nAnd we wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nOh there's the cocktail waitress!....\n\nAnd there she goes...\n\nWe flag her down.\n\nWe wait.\n\nand wait...\n\n2 hours later, still no drinks or food and the cocktail waitress is focusing on one side of the pool deck. We were getting hungry and was really hoping to order food by the poolside so we don't lose our spot.\n\nWe end up leaving and going to Pellegrino to get food. Of course, our spot was gone by the time we got back.\n\nI'm really sad that I had to write this review because I have been enjoying my stay thus far. \n\nWe're still checked in the Tropicana. Let's see how the rest of the week goes..."
0,"I find their instructor's voices, speech cadence and pseudo-spiritual narrative to be awfully annoying. I would rather they just allow some silence in the class. But, it is a good workout, not too expensive...and I suppose it's good practice to learn to learn to tune it out."
1,"Great spot \""off the beaten path\"" in the Willie St neighborhood. This distillery serves up their spoils via inventive cocktails, converting the distilling area into a cozy bar surrounded by whiskey barrels and fermenting vats. Only open Thursday-Saturday until 10pm. Get there early to snag an outside patio spot. \n\nThe Honey Cap was my fav, honey liquor with lime, honey, and club soda. Super refreshing on a warm summer night. The Dark and Storm goes down smooth and the bartenders mix up a great Whiskey Sour. All drinks are priced between $5-$7 and you can buy their 750 ml bottles to-go at the bar (before 9pm) for $30 or try a sample of a few of their 375 ml bottles. They serve up a cheese/charcuterie plate from Underground Food Collective, their only food option. Wonder if you can bring in food from outside? Can't see why not."

1,This is a nice Mom & Pop caf\u00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers.  Owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one. Prices are  reasonable. Cheerful and happy staff! Always meets  you with a smile. Omelets are HUGE!
0,"Word to the wise, order your burger well done here. You and your toilet will be thankful. \n\nP.S. Employees handling food should always wash their hands.\n\nThat's all I am going to say."
0,"I visited this restaurant on a girls trip for our 30th birthdays. We were in the mood for seafood and had wanted to check out Wynn. So, Lakeside worked out great. We made reservations and were greeted at the hostess station. When it was our turn to sit, they said the reservation name, and we obliged. Apparently, the name they said was in fact not ours, and we misheard. We realized once they walked us to our table, which was in a private dining room with a pre-fixed menu (clearly not for us!). When I shared with the hostess that I think there has been a mistake, she berated me like a child stating that she \""said the name three times!\"". So disrespectful! Your mistake is not my issue. I dismissed her and decided to approach a manager to address the situation rather than deal with her. I was assured he'd be right over to speak with me, which never happened. She must have let the entire waitstaff know her experience with us, because the whole time we were treated so inappropriately. \n\nHere we are, six hard-working girls from all over the country coming together to celebrate each other, and we were treated as if we were 18 years old on spring break. I'd also like to make mention that none of us had been drinking, we were dressed our age, and all of us have an appreciation for a nice meal and are willing to pay the price. In fact, our only intention for our final night was to enjoy a relaxed, beautiful dinner together. We were so disappointed. \n\nThe food was subpar. My swordfish was okay, the scallops were good. Small portions, large prices. The waiter was not interested in sharing specials or suggestions with us. \n\nI've been to so many restaurants in my life...I've had good, great, indifferent and bad service. My experience at Lakeside was by far the most insulting and negative dining experience I've ever encountered. Needless to say, I would never return, nor recommend this establishment."
1,"Who knew that you could find good solid eats inside a small casino off of Sahara on the east/central side of town?\n\nThe menu and set up is simple - just take an American diner and serve it with good ole Asian eats mixed with just a little Americana. \n\nI wish I could easily say that you have to come here and just try the one thing that absolutely rocks but in the end everything is good. From their tacos, to the bao, to the burgers and pot stickers. So I guess what I am saying is come hungry and come more than once. \n\nTheir bao's are my favorite. No matter which one you order, they have a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Their tacos are mini sized but full and bursting with the flavor. The burger will make your tongue slap the insides of your mouth. (My mouth is watering. I am ready for another visit just writing this review).\n\nAnd something as simple as fries they do just right. Crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. My two year old is a picky, picky eater even when it comes to something like fries and we had to sit and wait for him to finish every single last fry.\n\nThe servers now serve the food and describe to you what you are getting. Or at least on my last visit they did. It's food foreplay. Just tantalizing your taste buds before you take your first bite. \n\nI will be back soon. I have got to try their bone marrow and I am sure based on my past two experiences, I will not be disappointed. Maybe I will see you there!\n\n\nP.S. A definite plus I might add is that my first visit they didn't have high chairs, now they do. :) You can bring your kiddos.\n\nAnd I meant to take more pics on our last visit but we just started eating and then it was gone before we knew it :("
1,"Pita jungle is pita jungle is pita jungle. They're all the same, No matter which one you go to. They all have the awkward hipster  staff members and the food is the same at each one. Beyond that the food is always good and I appreciate they're being a healthy alternative on this side of town."
0,The food is marginal for an all you can eat type of restaurant. Don't expect anything  authentic but if you're really hungry then it might just be the right thing to hold you up. Certain items are better than others. Sashimi is not too fresh but entrees are ok. Sushi rice is too warm. Good and relaxing atmosphere but the staff seem to hate their jobs. If you have been here recently and rated anything higher than a 2 star then you really need to go out and try more stuff. I do not apply relativeness in my reviews so the disadvantages of being in Waterloo has no effect on my   rating. The reastaurant is rated the way it is.
1,"It was the first thai place ever I tried in vegas, and it ended up being my favorite. I come here way too often for lunch with my co workers. But the service and the food are awesome. Basil duck is the way to go! Since it is a pretty small place, the only downside is at rare very busy time, the food comes very very slow at big big parties."
0,"I've been taking my dog to Banfield since she was a puppy and usually have sub-par service. This time, however, I was even more disturbed by my visit. \n\nI had to wait almost 20 minutes until someone came into the room to see my dog and I. The vet tech was friendly, but the veterinarian was a different story. She kept badgering me about getting a wellness plan and hinted that the plan included dental care. When she looked at my dog, she then proceeded to make comments about my dog's teeth and plaque build-up. Clearly a scheme. \n\nThe most disturbing part about the visit was when my dog wouldn't eat the dog biscuit the vet tried to give her. When she wouldn't eat it, the vet proceeded to grab a can of Cheese Whiz (CHEESE WHIZ) off the counter and give my dog a big glob of it. \n\na) The vet did not even ask me if this was okay. Would you go up to someone's infant child and give it candy without asking the mother first? Probably not.\n\nb) I find it incredibly ironic that we're in a pet store surrounded by thousands of different kinds of dog treats, but the vet gives my dog processed human \""food.\"" I don't even eat cheese whiz, let alone feed it to my dog!\n\nc) The vet attempted justifying her case when she could tell I was disturbed by this. She said \""Well, dogs eat anything, they even eat out of the trash.\""  and \""It's real cheese.\"" wow. Her only valid justification was \""dogs need positive reinforcement after a visit\"" which I completely agree with. BUT, you couldn't find a more suitable option for a treat? \n\nAfter speaking with the manager of the store, Brenda, I was told that they use Cheese Whiz as a distraction and treat for dogs because they like it so much. Well, yeah, I'm sure they would like a Whopper and fries too, but clearly that wouldn't be the best option for them. When I asked her if she would recommend Cheese Whiz as a healthy treat for dogs, she said, \""Well, no, but a little bit doesn't hurt.\"" \n\nI highly doubt any veterinarian elsewhere would recommend Cheese Whiz as a suitable treat for dogs. \n\nNeedless to say, I am not giving Banfield any more of my service."
0,"I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \""I love Burgers\"" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here."
1,"The greatest dining experience I've ever had was at Hank's.  The beef is prime grade and the chefs there know what to do with it!  I've been there a few times, so I know it's not a fluke.\n\nI don't have much time to sing all of Hank's praises, but I can tell you that the ambiance is modern and swanky.  The heirloom tomato salad drew rave reviews from my buddies.  My filet mignon and lobster tail was outstandingly prepared.  My brother's porterhouse for two (and yes, the kid took out the 40oz beast by himself!) was equally outstanding.\n\nYou've seen all the other reviews.  There are only two things left to do...1) save up your money, cuz the bill won't be for the faint of heart...and 2) GO HUNGRY!!!"
0,"Wish I could give 0 stars. Save your time, save your money. This place is so not worth it, go somewhere else. I couldn't leave fast enough. The staff does not care about customer service and they all have piss poor attitudes. The clientele is disgusting and classless at best. This dump does NOT deserve your business!"
0,"Not a huge fan of this place, although the barber did give me a proper fade. I would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait.... its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless"
1,"So its $46 for Mon to thurs. $55 for Fri to sun. Great new place. Everything tastes top notch. Cons: There are lines to get the good meat and for seafood. Pros: This is worth the largest selection of food in Vegas. Cons: But I would say, wynn is good enough at a lower price for the crab legs. The crab legs were falling apart at bacchanal. Pros: u can get a souffle made in ten min. It's really good if they don't over bake it. There's macaroons, gelato, mochi which are the 4 best desserts.  The gelatin tho is better tasting at the wynn."
0,"Everyone has been telling me for weeks that since we now live in SouthEnd, we need to walk down to Ru San's.  We did... and likely won't very often.\n\nWe strongly prefer the normal size sushi and aren't fans of paying for a more expensive roll only to find out that it has more rice than the other rolls.  If a piece of sushi takes more than a bite, I'm not as big on it.  I like a roll to encapsulate all the flavors, not to get a little of this and a little of that in two bites.  That being said, wasn't a fan of the 'Dancing Eel'.  \n\nService was definitely sub par and the place is crazy noisy.  We plan to go back another time and will try the outdoor seating.  Also, the protein bomb looks great as it's hard to screw up nagiri.  The Cowboy was okay and the dumplngs were average dumplings.  \n\nWith better service, extract the noise, and ordering different things, there is still a chance for good food here.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and 3rd chances.  Check out the photos for what we ate!"
0,"I would not go back to this place, even though it is close. It looks run down and dirty inside, both in the waiting areas and exam rooms. I did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff. It seemed quick and not very thorough."
1,"First time in Phoenix and read the reviews on Yelp. I'm glad to pick this place and the employees are very friendly (Deaf Friendly too). I had Veronica as my stylist, she did an amazing job with my hair. Veronica understood exactly what I wanted and double checked with me to make sure what I wanted. Veronica did an excellent job with undercut and quiff style. I do recommend her (even she is so nice lady and cute too:\nShe work from Tuesday through Saturday)\n\nAs for interior, it's cute and rock looking salon. Very cute and simple, easy to relaxing while get hair done.\n\nI spent about $35 for cut and shampoo/conditioner plus tip too. I believe is the price is just right for me and felt it's worth it."
0,"Overrated, expensive, crowded, nowhere to sit unless you reserve an expensive table. \n\nWe were not on a VIP list so we had to wait in line. The wait was okay and the bouncers informed us the cover would be $28 a person. When we tried to negotiate, they offered us $20 a person to get in. Great start.\n\nYes, the club looks sleek and posh and the outdoor/indoor set up is nice. However, $15 for one shot seems a little excessive. And talk about CROWDED. The dance floor was a major CF. I could barely move let alone dance. And I felt like everywhere we were, people were constantly shoving past.\n\nThe music was cool when we first got there (pop and hip hop) but starting moving more in the direction of dance / house, which we did not like as much."
0,"I went to Honda West on august 25Th to shop for an accord. My sales person Nicol Grant was very friendly and not pushy. I Have gone to Honda East 1st but since they gave me a lower price on my Trade in i decided to go to this location to try to get a better price and i thought i did. My accord would cost a little bit cheaper n they offered me $800 more for my trade in so i bought the car from them that day but i had to come back the following day to sign all the paper work due to a printer malfunction.\n\n Gary Dvorsky was my finance guy, very talkative person. He finished all the paperwork with me and told me that Honda would pay off my trade in around 10 days. 5 days later i read all the paper work again and noticed that they payed $18500 for my trade in and not the $20000 that Nicol has offered me. I was pissed but my bad! I should've checked every single page.These people are very deceiving! You really have to read every letter or they will screw you over. \n\n10 days later after i bought the car i got a letter from Ally finacial which is the Lienholder of my trade in saying that im past due. 5 days later another letter so i called them to explain that i traded that car in so Honda is the one that needs to pay them off but not me. They said they havent heard from Honda so that car is still under my name and i need to pay it before sept 22 otherwise they would report to credit bureau. I called Gary and left a msg but he never got back to me. Called Nicol and she said i had to talk to Gary. Sept 16 I decided to go to Honda west to talk to him but he was busy with another customer so i talked to Andrew that apologized and said that he was going to find out why they havent payed my car off yet and would call me on the following day. I'm still waiting for a call!!! He said: Dont worry, if they report you to the credit bureau it will come right off after we pay them. After all these yrs building a very good credit and comes an Idiot and tells you that!! \n\nBottom line is: Once they get you to do business with them They care less about you as a customer. What a headache!!! So far i have nothing good to say about this place!\n\nStay away from them. I Bought my first honda from Honda east n for 5 yrs i had no problem whatsoever. For a couple $100s that i thought i've saved I should've kept businness with Honda East. What a regret!!!"
0,"10 Reasons NOT to stay at The Mirage Hotel:\n\nThe Mirage needs some serious management training and leadership skills in customer service. I was staying there for the Digital Auto Dealer Conference in early Oct 2011. Here are the \""low lights\"" of my stay:\n1. Called ahead to ask for early check in. I was told no problem. When I got there, they actually laughed at me and said \""no chance.\""\n2. I had to stow my bags with the bellman so I went to the \""Bell Desk\"" to do that and they acted like I was bothering them and then pointed that I should go outside to do that.\n3. Once in my room, I called the bell desk several times to retrieve my bags, getting an automated attendant and COMMERCIALS! while I was waiting for someone to pick up. It took 4 tries to get someone on the phone and once I did, Cynthia laughed at me when I told her the substandard experience I had just received. I actually asked her, \""Are you laughing at me?\"" but she didn't reply.\n4. Whenever you call any dept in the hotel, they don't know your name. They ask you every time to state your name, making me feel unimportant.\n5. Most every hotel these days has an in-room coffeemaker. Mine didn't so I called room service. I like to have hot water in the mornings so I asked about it and they said I would have to order hot water from room service! Really???\n6. I did like they said, I ordered hot water from room service and guess what?  It tasted and smelled like coffee!\n7. There was no shower cap (I know this is a small one but to those of us with long hair, it's a big deal).\n8. The rooms are dirty, they need a makeover.  Appalling.\n9. After I checked out I had time before my flight so I asked where in the hotel could I work for a few hours without any cigarette smoke (since I am allergic).  I was told the only place in the hotel where there is no smoking was Starbucks.  Thank you Starbucks for being the only bright spot in my stay at the Mirage.\n10. I had to visit the ladies' room during my Starbucks stay and had to walk far into the casino to get there.  When I did, there was no toilet paper in ANY of the stalls.\nWith that, I called a taxi and left for the airport early.  DO NOT stay at the Mirage Hotel.  Run away and never come back!"
1,"Awesome staff, great food and cool decor"
1,"You're likely to score when you hit up Monroe Street, but this place abuses the privilege. The best offering at Brasserie V is definitely the beer selection: they have about 12 on tap every day plus plenty of bottles. They have quite the selection of wine too.\n\nFood's pretty good, modern American and quite tasty. The caprese sandwich was quite good, as were the truffle frites. \n\nPerfect for a first date or happy hour, definitely hit it up!"
1,"This place is great! I received SO much stuff for my son when he was born (mostly barely worn hand-me downs from my husband's huge family and some of my close friends) that he couldn't possibly wear them all even if I changed his outfit 5 times a day! So I went on the hunt for a great consignment place I could utilize to get him \""new\"" clothes as he grew. \nLuckily for me, there are quite a few places like this in my area (central phoenix). I checked out 2 others before I came to Smarty Pants (do NOT go to Urban Baby! Ugh!). \nThe mother-daughter owner team at SP were very welcoming and friendly. They took almost all of the items I brought in and although I planned to just drop stuff off, I couldn't resist shopping for myself and ended up with three great tops for $15 total!! Incredible inventory, clean shop and friendly service... who wouldn't love it??\n\nThey informed me that they are expanding to the space right next to Bertha's (my favorite restaurant in town) to have a separate place for furniture and will be offering more adult clothing in the current space (I could have that backwards.... the new space is for clothes, perhaps?). \n\nSo I will be heading back soon to spend my consignment money! Thank you Smarty Pants!"
0,"I really wanted to be blown away by this place.  Although it is better than the previous restaurant in this location, El Rico, it fell w-a-y short of my expectations.  \n\nMany of the other reviewers gave such high ratings that I literally drove the mile and a half down the road with my mouth watering.  We arrived and sat inside and downstairs.  The ambiance was not so great. We heard everyone else's conversations and the chandelier lighting was sharp bright and made my pupils itch.  Then the salsa arrived.  Hmm... sweet instead of heat.  I didn't like how the salsa was served really cold either. Then I ordered the carne burro.  It was OK.  But the enchilada sauce was nasty. Oh, and the rice and beans were \""turable!\"" (as Charles Barkley would say).  Lastly, my girl had awful gas after we got home and kept denying it.  Not a great outing."
1,Brought my family (group of 9) here for a nice dinner on the patio- great idea! They can accommodate large groups and there is plenty of beer to go around! The atmosphere is true to what you would find over in Germany- loud and boisterous! If you're not into loud music and chanting- sit on the patio- you'll be glad you did! The view is spectacular! \nThe food was also nice- ordered schnitzel sandwich and potato pancakes.
1,This has to be one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas!! On our way to the concert we needed to get some food and as we walked by this spot we just had to stop. The smell of the pizza wouldn't let me walk any further. They make it just right and you watch them every step of the way! For how expensive it is to get a decent meal with good customer service on the strip this spot is a must do! The price is unbeatable and the taste will keep you coming back for more.
0,"Guy Fieri needs a slap in the face! \n\nThe Four Kegs has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waitress we had was slooowww and very forgetful. It was as if she was on medication or something worse. We arrived during off peak hours for dinner, 9 pm. \n\nAfter a 45 minute wait the first  of five strombolis  made it to our table--all the strombolis arrived at different times (5-10 minutes apart). Very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat. One stromboli never made it to the table, we had to flag down our medicated waitress to check on the order (which she forgot to put in). Our waitress also forgot to put in our appetizer order--we reminded her and it came after the meal. \n\nThe one forgotten stromboli finally made it to our table AFTER everyone completed their meals, and it was ICE-COLD in the middle. \n\nThe manager never compensated us or apologized for THEIR screw-ups. Very disappointing.\n\nGuy Fieri should be ashamed of himself for highlighting this dive on TV, he lost a lot of credibility with all of us.\n\nOh, and the stromboli and appetizer (fried mac and cheese) was just average, nothing to brag about."
0,This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.
0,"Terrible experience here this afternoon.  Had a friend in from out of town visiting and was treating them to lunch but was kicked out of the restaurant. When going to order waitress asked for my ID which I handed her and she said that two months ago a law was passed that did not allow verticals id's anymore. So I said that's fine I won't get beer and went to just order my sandwich, she then stated that unless the gentleman with me was my father I couldn't even eat there.  I'm 28yrs old, I could understand if I looked 18 but are you kidding me?? Embarrassing experience, a simple warning and letting me at least continue to eat lunch would have been a better experience."
0,"The security is very rude and disrespectful,  so are most of the managers.  I don't recommend anyone of color to go there because they are racist and they discriminate!!! This wasn't the first time it's happened to myself and a few others in line.  They say no flats on ladies night yet all the Hispanic chicks were flat boots, yet when my sister had them on they turned us away! DISCRIMINATON! !!!!! Who ever own this place needs new security, management ASAP or they will loose a lot of business. As long as your popping bottles they don't care.  Smh, the Damn food isn't even that great! If you're looking for a good time this isn't the place."
0,"Just returned from a week in Vegas and had dinner at Del Frisco's on my trip.  This was by far the most disappointing meal of the trip.\n\nSERVICE\nWe took a cab from the Venetian over to the restaurant and got there about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation.  It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was not that busy.  I checked in with the host and we were told that we needed to wait til our reservation time...so we sat and waited 10 minutes until our reservation time and we were seated.  Noone left the restaurant in the time we were waiting.\n\nDuring our meal, the server never checked on us, and when she did she had a very sarcastic almost put-off tone.  We did not order wine and she seemed to resent that for some reason.  When we passed on dessert as well, she said \""I thought you would say that.\"".  She had a major attitude like we were there to serve her rather than her serving us.   We were in a private room with about 5 other tables and each of the other table had the manager or a host or someone checking on them during the meal.  Noone stopped by our table.  \n\nFOOD\nThe menu looked fantastic and we ordered the chopped salad, a porterhouse, and a filet with shrimp & scallops.  The salad was fantastic.  The porterhouse was ordered medium-rare and the filet was ordered medium.  When the steaks came out, the filet was rare and the porterhouse was a nice medium-rare.  My date sent her filet back because it was a long way from medium.  They took my porterhouse back as well, but I told them to only keep it warm as it was cooked perfectly.  Well, 10 minutes later, they bring both steaks back and the filet was still only medium-rare and my steak had been over-done to a medium almost medium-well.  I had cut into my steak to check it before going back and when it came back, it was completely dried out.  The shrimp on my date's filet was absolutely rotten.  I have had good shrimp, bad shrimp, and spoiled shrimp...and the shrimp she got was definitely spoiled.  We ordered sides of macaroni & cheese and spinach--both highly recommended on the yelp board.  Even though, the meal was unenjoyable to that point, I was open to enjoying the sides...but they were beyond disappointing.  Flavorless, poorly seasoned, and not well exectued at all.  Cracker Barrel quality sides in my opinion.\n\nOne last comment on the steaks:  I like salt, but these steaks were so over-seasoned, it was almost hard to get down.  You could see the kosher salt crystals on the outside of the steak.  It was disturbing how over-salted the meat was.  \n\nI would not go back to Del Frisco's even if I were given a free meal.  There are a lot of nicer steakhouses in Vegas and I recommend Envy, N9ne, The Palm, or others."
0,"I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there."
1,We just finished a kitchen cabinet remodel and couldn't be more happy. Working with David and his sub contractors couldn't have gone any smoother.  Whenever David said he would be at our home he was there right on time as were the other sub contractors. All calls were returned promptly. These are things you would expect but usually don't occur. ...as to the job David ideas and attention to detail  and execution were terrific. Additionally the remodel was fairly priced and completed on time. Our kitchen look fantastic and we would definitely recommend his company.\n\nPete and Jane Gruber
0,"My family has shopped at Apache Junction  Fry's location for 10 plus years and have been very pleased till now. This last week I was looking to buy bacon and a few other items. I noticed that the items near and including the bacon had sell by dates almost two months ago. One had may 4th 2014. I found five different items and total more than 20, yes 20+ i made a huge pile. It appeared that the stockers had not checked any dates for at least two month's.  When I talked to store manager he stated he would talk to that department. Didn't seem to be that important to him because he continued doing a walk thru with a  produce employee.  Nasty, now im wondering if the lunch meat is what got my son and I sick last week. CHECK DATES"
1,Wonderful find! I just saw her today and all I can say is I hit the jackpot! I just moved to az and as any woman knows trying to find someone to do a Brazilian wax is a pretty anxious experience but right when I met her I felt comfortable. She knows exactly what she is doing and from someone that has been waxing over 12 years I can say she is the best! I have very sensitive skin and have always left everywhere else with some soreness/sensitivity and today I left without any of that. She was quick and efficient. I also got a facial as I bought her yelp deal and she also did a fantastic job on that. No need for me to look any further I have found my regular estetician! Also want to add my navigation took me to a field so if yours takes you there turn around and it's in a strip mall on the left.
1,"I recommend Sonoma Grille without reservation.  I have, as of this review, eaten lunch there three times, and each time the food has been amazing, the prices have been extremely reasonable, the portions have been just right, the meals have come out fresh and staggeringly quickly, and the wait staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  The decor is gorgeous, the tables are neither too close to nor too far from one another (there's plenty of seating away from the bar), and it really is, TARDIS-like, bigger on the inside.  \n\nNow, normally, I like to recommend particular dishes.  I'll do that here, but understand that the Sonoma Grille menu changes with some frequency (it has done so once since the first time I ate there about six weeks ago).  If these things are still on the menu, I recommend the Pittsburgh Chopped Salad (so named, I believe, because of the crispy shoestring potatoes on top of it), the Amish Chicken Breast with fetuccine, the panko fried shrimp appetizer (which is what popcorn shrimp wants to be when it grows up - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spiced to perfection), and the sweet & spicy salad.  You can add a protein to any of the salads - for the PGH salad, I added salmon, and for the sweet & spicy one, I added chicken breast.  \n\nEvery time I've eaten there, I've been blown away.  And I haven't even checked out the wine menu yet!!"
1,"I've frequent this establishment a couple of times for takeout. Each time I got the hot and sour soup. I decided to dine in tonight because I wasn't feeling well. The restaurant was half full, yet quiet. My hearty shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious and filling. I didn't realize just how hungry I was until I saw the bottom of the dish! \n\nThe staff was very pleasant, but they speak Chinese. I found it difficult to understand them at times. They sent their best English-speaking guy to my table and I was able to order a dish that wasn't on the menu (yay!)."
0,"I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.\n\nGC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\n\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \""new\"" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\n\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\n\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing."
0,"I don't know about you guys, but I think the only place Chinese food should be based from is China. If this is \""New York\"" style Chinese food, then I guess I don't like it. \n\nI have eaten at many Chinese and Asian restaurants in town and this location is at the bottom of my rankings. \n\nWhen this restaurant first opened, every citizen of Sun City and other Summerlin residents flocked to it. It is rare to find actual Chinese people cooking Chinese food, but this location is authentic in that sense. Customer service was great at this location, but their food was the opposite. It isn't horrible, but I do eat Chinese food so much that I have higher standards for it. \n\nThis place is always busy, but a lot of people are there only waiting for take out. There are a decent amount of tables, but I would not bring a group here. You can also call in your order and pick it up. \n\nOverall, besides the food, I think this place is run well by management. You may like this place, like the other reviewers. I just personally do not."
1,"So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! \n\nI loved the show! The performers are amazing!! & it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!"
0,"I should have tried the subs, according to the other reviews those are good. We got 4 pizzas and not one of them was even edible. They were tasteless and the toppings were blah. I would never get the pizza again. Had it not been the Tuesday night special where the 2nd pizza was 99 cents, I would have felt completely ripped off."
0,"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else."
0,"They look full so I decided to give it a try.  People standing at a Panda Express set up line, order in a foreign language, so it is usually a good sign, that the food is authentic.  But when we order the sweet and sour pork, the lady behind the glass give us All fat pork.  A minute ago, I saw she spooned all lean pork from the same dish to a lady who obviously speak their language.  So that is a big turn-off, I am not coming back again."
0,"I have been to this jiffy lube before and the service here has always been great. However, after my most recent trip here, let's just say things weren't so great.  I parked my car behind the building where the line says 'SMOG LINE' and a manager approached me. He mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half. He asked me if I wanted to wait and I said yes. Then he started sweating and looked around nervously and suggested to me another business around the corner with much faster service even after I agreed to wait. I've never been basically told to kick rocks by a manager especially as a paying customer. I'm not too sure what drugs or drinks had been consumed but this was just crazy. I've never felt so embarrassed and stupid leaving a business before. Basically defeating my purpose of getting in the car in the first place. \n\n\nThis WAS my neighborhood car repair service center, but after this experience I will definitely look to yelp in finding a new care center for my vehicle!!"
0,"After reading reviews both here and on other sites, we decided to try it.  It was 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  The whole dining experience began with them out of the Vietnamese appetizer I wanted to try.  So I ordered 2  old stand-bys - wanton soup & an egg roll.  My husband ordered steamed dumplings.  Soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted.  Egg roll was greasy, cold & tasteless.  Only the hot mustard saved it.  Dumplings were very good.  Ordered chicken with cashew nuts.  Not a single cashew. Veggies might have been waved over the wok - huge pieces of green pepper, celery (stalk cut into 1/3's), big chunks of carrots all so crunchy, I almost asked for a dip to go with them!  Food very cold.  When I complained there was not 1 nut on plate, he said they forgot to put them on top.  He came back with a dish of warm cashews and put them on my entree.  No sense in complaining about temp of food - I don't take any chances of irritating the chef/cook.  While my husband liked what he ordered (can't remember - poh something with chicken), it also was cold.  Only item that was hot was the complimentary tea.  Best thing about this restaurant - our waiter was pleasant & polite - we tipped him the usual 20% we tip - it wasnt his fault. We absolutely love the food at Yummy's in the Rostraver/Belle Vernon area.  We like to order take-out.  We live 20 minutes from there and the food is piping hot when we get it home!  We won't stray from there again.  Sorry, Me Lyng - food was cold, tasteless & mine was lacking one of the titled ingredients.  Never again."
1,Always hits the spot when your sweet tooth is going Crazy! My favorite the Chocolate Chocolate Chip!!
1,"The weather was great, the music was rocking,  lots of people came out to have a good time and drink some beer. The best vendor stand by far was yelp's. They had killer pretzels. I didn't get to wander too much because I worked the entrance. Everyone that came thru our gate was cool and seemed to be having a good time"
1,"I'm going to give this place 5 stars only because I feel bad I kinda threw up on their floor... \n\nI'm really sorry, Jimmy. I was really trashed!!"
0,"I have wanted to see this ever since I turned 18 because I am fascinated by the idea of sophisticated nudity.  Anyway, I finally got to go and it was a total disappointment.  The opening and closing numbers were quite impressive, and what I expected (the stage was full, large costumes, etc.) but the middle parts were strange story lines that didn't make sense, a ton of men singing and dancing (I wanted to see showGIRLS!)  and the worst part was the choreography: the timing was way off and everyone looked like they had a different style of doing everything.  I was expecting to be amazed at the precision but was totally let down.\n\nI will say that the interludes they had between the numbers was quite good.  There was a pair of men doing acro stuff, a man on silks and a gentleman who twirled these giants shapes in the air, and when the light caught the metallic of the shapes, it created a sort of psychedelic color thing.  We were more entertained by the interludes than anything else.\n\nThe set piece for the Titanic was cool, though.  All in all, if we hadn't spent so much money on the tickets, I would have left early so I could get to Pure nightclub to see New Kids on the Block."
0,"I should've written this review ages ago! For awhile I thought that this place was pretty good, but then I got a car wash over at Octopus on University. I then realized how good of a wash I should have been getting. Since then I haven't gone back. When Mermaid has a crazy deal, it's ok for the price. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. They just don't clean the interior as well as Octopus. Every employee I've dealt with is very, very nice though."
0,"Appears to be out of business, no web site, phone disconnected and nobody there!"
1,"this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread, beer, wine and cheeses.  i was very impressed with the quality of their food, espresso and cleanliness of their store.  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat.  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts, cards and books and other unique stuff.   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices, this place is very hard to beat.  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle."
1,"Stick to the pancakes and steel cut oatmeal , and you won't regret it! Came in with the family last weekend for breakfast. Although we ordered a few other things it's not worth the rave. But the pancakes and oatmeal are!!! How can oatmeal be so good? Smooth and creamy.. No lumps at all. Topped with sugar and berries. The pancake was the best I've had from a restaurant! Fluffy and buttery. Sinfully delicious. Ah I'm drooling.."
0,"Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here."
1,"Time to update my last review.  The same points still apply, however since then we've been to the nightclub here a few times, Chateau.  It's a pretty cool place to go and has added a different element to the resort experience here.\n\nWe've also dined at Mon Ami Gabi a few times as well.  Excellent restaurant with an inside/outside feel.  Dining on the patio is great for people watching.\n\nWith these new experiences combined with our past experiences, this is one of our fav's to visit on the Strip.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%"
1,This is a decent place to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and some nosh with a friend.  I would give it five stars but I'm rather turned off by the inside seating area.  This place is best when you can sit outside in cool weather.  Especially around sunset =)\n\nOccasionally they do have live music playing outside which adds to the ambiance of the dimly lit evenings.  A relaxing atmosphere that I think is a must to enjoy =)
1,"Located in the Wynn hotel (my favorite!)\n\nWe were lucky enough to score awesome tickets to Le Reve through the discount tickets counter.  The theatre is great, and there is not a bad seat in the house.  The first two rows are \""splash\"" rows, so they tend to be a little cheaper.  We sat a row behind the splash rows, and I only felt a little bit of splash.  \n\nThe best part of the show, the amazing dives!  Since the show was a water show, I was so amazed at their ability to hold on to each other without slipping! \n\nTruly an amazing show.  If you like Cirque to Soleil, you will like Le Reve."
1,"Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again."
1,So delish! Every doughnut I have had has been absolutely amazing! My favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake
1,I really loved FilmBar.\n\nI love the atmosphere... dark and mysterious.\n\nI loved the friendly service.\n\nI love the selection of movies. We saw Rust and Bone which was EXCELLENT.\n\nI love the decent prices of tickets and beverages. The drinks are twice as much at other theaters that serve alcohol.\n\nI love that you can bring in outside food. I recommend something easy to eat if you do this. Carly's Bistro has great sandwiches and they are right around the corner.\n\nYes there are many hipsters. I have noticed that the Daria/Alanis Morisette angry grunge chick look is coming back... hmmmmmm. But I don't mind the hipsters. It's a movie theater. You don't have to hear them talk. :)\n\nThe only thing I don't love about FilmBar? It is too damn far from my house. But it is worth the drive.
0,"I am from San Diego and visited this facility on Wednesday with my family in hopes of some delicious Mexican food. Unfortunately, it was terrible. I ordered 2 of the Carne Asada Fries and 2 carne asada tacos and 3 drinks. The total was overpriced at  $25.  The tacos were small treet tacos and the carne asada fries were a small saucer size serving. The carne asada fries has some nasty nacho cheese, which I have never seen on carne asada fries before. I have to say this was the worst mexican food I have ever had in my life! I will never come back to that place. BTW they get 1 star because I cannot post with no stars."
0,"As lovers of sketchy Jamaican and Caribbean restaurants, my boyfriend and I (newcomers to Madison) decided to try Jamerica for dinner. We had sampled their jerk chicken at Taste of Madison this summer but wanted to get the full experience, not to mention that I had a mad craving for some coconut rice and stewed cabbage. It was cold outside, so we decided to grab a case of Capital's Winter Skal and get our jerk chicken to go. Entrees on the dinner menu range from 11.50-15.50 each, which is pushing it for me, but they are cooked to order which is much appreciated. Jerk chicken will set you back 11.50, and if you want some delicious plantains they'll charge another $3. The chicken was dark meat, skin on, bone in and we got 4 thighs with our one meal. The jerk sauce was not very spicy or flavorful, and the chicken was quite greasy. The rest of the styrofoam takeout container was filled with a mixture of stewed cabbage, carrots, and broccoli on one side and rice and red beans on the other. Not much flavor there either :( In my opinion the best part were the plantains, but as I said earlier it was $3 for about 6 or 7 pieces. \nThe inside is very inviting on a cold night and the decor is eclectic. Next time I'll go for lunch and stay a while. In the meantime, I'll try David's."
0,"Always looking for a better burger, I was encouraged by the buzz on this place. This will be a real quick review, not some long winded piece of too much information.\nService wasn't very good. 2 out of 3 burgers came out wrong. Sent one of them back twice because they didn't believe (or couldn't believe) that is wasn't prepared as ordered.\nBad way to start off a first time visit. The fries, in my opinion, were too limp and not crispy enough for my tastes.\nThe burgers were actually good, tasty meat and good quality buns but my 2 start rating is because the whole experience wasn't very good."
1,"Located 2061 West Sunset Road Henderson, NV just off sunset and sunset.  This location is just a bit hidden but just and welcoming as the other locations.  On this trip I ordered that same as the last just to check the consistency factor.  I must say my No. 9 Cheese Enchilada & Beef Taco was every bit as good as the Lindo Michoacan location.  The Sala again was the start of the meal.  I think we are going to make these out new favorite Mexican Cuisine locations.\n\nThis location has closed."
0,"Sunday brunch, is just average, nothing special. As for the selection I felt it lacked in variety...basic breakfast foods and flatbread pizzas. (Upstream set the bar high for brunch) the food wasn't cold but  could've been hotter. Previous reviews said the beer was watered down, it must be a theme w/their alcohol selections b/c the Bloody Mary was watered down as we'll, I'm not sure if it's the mix they used...have definitely had better.  The atmosphere is cool and it was packed, but just don't see what all the hype is about."
1,"If you want to sit down and eat you better be prepared to a) wait in a line on the street and b) share a table with strangers. In any other setting either scenario may have surprised or irked me, but on this day I was so game for it and ended up thinking these two features added so much charm and warmth to the place.\n\nThe smoked turkey sandwich was moist, tender, and so yummy. Topped with mustard on white bread, heaven. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The dill pickle was massive and damn good. And the cole slaw was barely dressed and some of the best I've ever eaten. \n\nOur server was excellent! He was funny, personable, and super fast. With such quick turn over I was expecting crap service and not planning to hold anything against it. But our guy could probably serve the whole place with his eyes closed and just rock it. I loved him.\n\nSuper cheap, quick food, awesome setting, great value. Must go. No wonder this place has the best reviews and is the highest rated. Awesome!"
0,Service was good food was kind of crappy. It's kind of like IHOP with bigger portions.
1,"I have a strange habit of always searching for chicken and waffles in any city that I visit. \nSo there I was in Phoenix for the weekend and I came across reviews for Lo-Lo's. The reviews looked right, so off we went...\n\nI can see why some people say it's located in a sketchy area, but everyone knows that's where you find the best food!\nIt was about 1pm on a Saturday and the place was packed, but we got seated right away. \n\nI had the number 3, Lo-Lo's - 3 piece, 2 waffles, and a side of corn bread. My girlfriend had Puff's Chicken Tender Basket and we shared some mac & cheese.\n\nThe food was excellent, especially the corn bread! \nThe service was great, we had about 4-5 different people walk by and ask us how we were doing.\n\nAlso, I loved the mason jars.\n\nSee you next time I'm in Phoenix!"
0,"I'm guessing the number of great reviews on this place is due to the fact that most people on The Strip in Vegas are drunk and have the munchies.  While the menu looks great, the food is underwhelming.  We had the Chili Fries for an appetizer - it was OK, but nothing special.  Then we had the Mayor of Flavortown.  The sandwich was kind of dry.  The seasoning on the fries was strange - almost sweet - not what I want in a French fry.  The staff was great and I liked the atmosphere, but we won't give it another try."
1,wow. i can't believe this place closed up shop.  i wish there were more places like this in this town
0,"I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here."
0,"Scramble indeed. Scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood IHOP or Village Inn...at least you'll pay less for equally dismal food. I expected so much more from a new neighborhood place, especially one that's gotten some good reviews and publicity. First of all, I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places, but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for. Breakfast is just a full service kind of meal, at least to me. The decor/design is certainly nice and modern, but I wish the food matched. With the exception of their \""brizzas\"" (breakfast pizzas), their menu items are the kinds of basic things you'd find at any chain (actually, there's less selection than many chains). We tried the pancakes (we asked for 2 buttermilk and one multigrain) with carmelized bananas. They brought out the pancakes first and then said the bananas would just be a couple minutes. When they finally brought it out, it was one banana halved and carmelized, for three large pancakes - terrible presentation. The pancakes themselves were no better than IHOP. The eggs benedict was equally disappointing - they were served in an ocean of hollandaise sauce, the ham was a tad too salty, and the english muffins were soggy. Originally, I thought of trying one of the \""brizzas\"" since they're unique to this place, but I'm glad I didn't. The woman next to me was eating one - it was basically eggs and cheese on a raw-looking flat dough. She didn't appear to be enjoying it at all, picking the eggs off and leaving the dough. I guess I'll be sticking to The Breakfast Club when I do breakfast out."
1,Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.
1,I live near this shop. The reviews guided me to this establishment. I tried to call before going and much to my disappointment YELP CONTAINS THE wrong number. The correct number is 702-434-9333
0,"Omg I'm so f*ckn pissed at this place! I paid for $25 of meatless pizza and 2 bottles of water! All I can taste in my pizza was anchovies and a few pieces of prosciutto/sopresatta that I paid extra for! They should've given me more meat!!! The crust was soggy, too much sauce and barely had any basil. I wish I could've taken a pic but I forgot. I was so annoyed at how stingy these toppings were, I don't understand because some of the pics actually looked good and more generous...argh I'm so fckn angry!!!"
1,"We were greeted at the door by a young lady letting me know it would be a 20 min wait for a booth.  The place is a bit small and looks like it may fit about 100?\n\nOnce inside Angel greeted us with our menus. \n\nFood came to us QUICK!! \n\nWe had:\n\nPeanut butter waffle - it's peanut butter chips melted on waffles. yum!!\nPlain waffle - butter n maple syrup soooo good!\nTexas eggs and bacon sandwich was delicious\nScrambled eggs - plain variety\nEggs over medium - PERFECTLY MADE!! \nGrits - kinda clumpy\nHashbrowns - processed, but none the less fine\nCoffee - great cup of cafe Java\n\nAngel is an awesome server, though the cashier mentioned she from another House... Just helping out here as most of their crew is in Vegas for a wedding.  They need to snatch Angel up! She was super busy but still kept up with checking in on us.   Everyone there is so friendly!\n\nI literally walked out with a smile from the great experience.  Talk about starting the morning off right! :)"
0,The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.
0,"I went this this location shopping yesterday on28th.stop by at aldo shoes store because they have a great deal50% off on sale.i saw a  pair of sandal that i really like i ask the guy works there if they have my size and he went in the back and brought it to me but it looks like lots of people tried on it so i asked him if he can order for me online. he looked at me just think am annoying and say \""what they r only about 20bucks\""even i order for u online its gonna all the same theres no guarante.\""\ni feel upset at this time just said thank u and walked away he act like he was not care did not even response you are welcome or have a nice day something like that.\ni mean its not about 20bucks im paying it i wanna get what i wanna or just be nice to your customers."
1,"I found Heaven while walking down the Strip.\n\nThis place is AMAZING. It is nothing like my LVs back home! I was blown away. It was absolutely packed beyond belief as it was New Year's Eve, but I didn't mind. The staff looked a bit frazzled and maybe was a bit short when talking to them, but I understood, as there really may have been 600 people in here. Because of the crowds, it made it a bit easier to shop without feeling like you're being stalked. I knew exactly what I wanted and my purchase was quick and easy. The fact that both of us were carrying Vuitton may or may not have helped us get the sales associates' attention, but either way they were fantastic for such a busy time.\n\nI would advise any LV lover to swing by here if they get a chance, you won't be disappointed! Now every time I visit my usual LVs, I think back misty-eyed to such a magical place."
0,"Zero stars,  if I  could give it. This place SUCKS. The waitress shows up to take your order, drop off your food and give you a check. Doesn't stop by to see if you need anything. Place is filthy. Food is terrible. Service horrible.  Will never  return to a Long Wongs restaurant."
0,"This TJ's needs to replace the lady who was serving the strawberry short bread dessert on 5/24.   This TJ's has always had exceptional staff members that are friendly and very helpful which is why we drive over 10+ miles every other week for our TJ's purchases.\n\nSo if you are serving a dessert with organic strawberries, whipped cream and short bread to anyone and a 13 year kid comes up ....... and TJ's has an issue with allergies etc. just say, \""Sorry, we need a parent\"", instead of smacking a kids hand away from the sample and then saying \""if you fall from allergies, I am not going to help you\"".  \n\nThe staff here always been so helpful, fun and friendly so why would you put a person like that at a sampling station who would say something so unnecessary.    I think she needs to take a refresher course at TJ's Customer Service 101.\n\nThanks For Listening........"
0,"The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers."
0,"Everything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, if GSS had called me right after my wedding I would have paid the balance in full so I really didn't understand the email letting me know how kind they were to wave late charges that would have been their issue to begin with since they neglected to phone me to get the balance after services were rendered. It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a \""sorry\"".... \""please call us as soon as possible and make final payment\"".... not what I expected. Cupcakes were cute and tasted pretty good, from what I was able to taste.... a little pricey but that's the trend I guess. I was disappointed in their lack of remorse over the late delivery and their annoying email about neglecting to call me for payment, I think I should have at least received some kind of a peace offering."
0,"Saw Dr. Shannon Chandler for an exam and contact lenses. She acknowledged my need for contacts and agreed to file the claim against my insurance. Actually got the managers approval to do so, she said. This was in May.  Every two weeks since I have been promised that the contacts are coming, now 2 months later the insurance tells me they never filed the paperwork. Apparently they don't make enough doing so.\n\nUsed to be you could trust doctors. Not these guys though.  Go somewhere else."
1,"Love this place! We've (myself and my fianc\u00e9, Stacy F., a fellow Yelper) been a total of three times so far, twice to the Scottsdale location and once to the downtown Phoenix location. The food is always hot and fresh, the wait staff and bar tenders friendly and helpful, and there's a fun open air layout. \n\nThe pork tacos are phenomenal, although I'm not crazy about the black beans and rice on the side.  We moved out here from Florida last May, and out that way we're far more used to yellow rice with our black or red beans, so it's merely a matter of personal preference.  The food is prepared exceptionally well.  Tonight I tried the spicy Asian wings with a side of regular fries, which were even better than I expected. When it comes to drinks, the Dr. Funk is our favorite so far, but there are plenty more we have yet to try. \n\nOverall this is one of our new favorite restaurants in the greater phoenix area, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I personally prefer the new Scottsdale location, but you can't go wrong with either!"
1,"Excellent for service. Burgers were just burgers. Good, but expected spectacular!"
0,"this store started out nice, but within about a year it had already destroyed itself. The floors are already dirty, the lot is ALWAYS  a mess, the people inside are rude and HATE their life apparently. Ask them a question and they might just cut themself with their box cutter. This location NEVER  has enough lanes open and the self-checkout employess are never to be found. To top off everything else, the prices are actually really high. It makes me sad that people just let walmart lie to them about having the lowest prices, because they most certanly do NOT. I've price compared a few different places and the Target across the 215 actually had the lowest average prices on food and HBA. It's got a full grocery on the Garden Center side so that is where I will be going for groceries for now on, I will never step foot in this lying, filthy, horrid trap again. Now if only the moron \""security\"" guy would get the hell out of the way!"
1,"Just ate there last night with my girlfriend, and it was AWESOME!!!  The braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork, the cocktails are great, and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances."
0,"Service: 0/5 Wasn't the most welcoming that's for sure. When I walked in I stood in the door way/waiting area for like 5 minutes as I waited and stared at each employee of this place idk maybe because I wasn't Korean I wasn't getting the best service at the door. Finally we got seated, I felt rushed by my waitress and trust me after she dropped off our dishes that was the last time I saw her. She never came back to refill our waters or anything. Flagging someone down just to pay the bill was also an issue no one paid attention to us. \n\nKim Chi Beef: 3/5  I liked their Kim Chi beef but it doesn't compare to other places I've tried. A bit mediocre it was very watery and salty. I had huge chunks of Kim Chi which I liked but I had no idea where he \""beef\"" was. I'm guessing it had to be some sort of ground beef. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSeafood Beef: 2/5  My boyfriend got this dish because he loves sea food in this Tofu, but omg super salty it tasted to bland not even tasty. There was barely any sea food in his the only thing I could recall were scallops and they tasted like imitation scallops. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSide dishes: 2/5 I actually really liked their assortment of side dishes but our waitress was never around to refill them. I was pretty disappointed."
0,"High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.\n\nThe experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far.\n\nThe lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.\n\nThe cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment. \nA good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon. \nThis was anything but. \nThis salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor.\nNow, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.\n\nWe also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare. \nSo rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.\n\nAfter this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu. \nHow weird is that?\nIt was like he had ESP.\n\nThroughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment.\n\nIronically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience. \nTanzy, please, there's no need to respond.\n\nI don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late.\nThe time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.\n\nWhat you should do instead is:\nGordon Ramsey your Executive Chef.\nMake the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes.\nAnd finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo."
0,"I was so amped up for this event and when I arrived, I was immediately unplugged. This was my first encounter with Glendale's Chocolate Affair and my expectations were set WAAAAY too high.  Where are the elaborate chocolate displays and demonstrations? Where are the artisians? The enthusiasts? The chocoholics?  All I saw were ridiculous lines of people waiting to pay too much for your basic fair food in which some of it was dipped in chocolate. BFD.  Maybe it was the best chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick ever, but I will never know because I'm not waiting any longer than 15 minutes to find out. \n\nNext time, I'm just going to head down the Central Phoenix Farmer's Market where I can give my money to local folks who are passionate about their craft and are fantastic at what they do. (Bite Me Brownies, \nWei of Chocolate, etc.) I won't have to wait in line longer than It's a Small World at Disney for some crappy apple dipped in chocolate. \n\nThankfully, we didn't bring the dogs as they would've been trampled and I feel sorry for the people who had their little ones in strollers because they were like salmons swimming upstream.  I overheard one dad say that he had had enough.  He was taking the stroller back to the car and just carry the baby. \n\nOn a positive note, the entertainers were good for the time I was there and I found the little area shops charming."
1,I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\n\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?
0,Purchased a Living Social deal for them.  When I first called to schedule they said they didn't have anything available for almost 2 months. I had to agree to pay a $25 for service sooner.  The wood flooring we were having installed got delayed so had to reschedule our appointment.  It took me calling and leaving two urgent messages for callback and then she said she couldn't help me in the time frame I needed.  Worst part- she didn't seem to care.  Don't sell deals that you can't fulfill!!!
0,"Went there in 2008 for one varicose vein.. Dr. Herion was so positive and enformed me he would fix it and I would feel better. Got the ablation done.. Months later No relief in fact i kept getting clots ..i went to er twice because the clots scared me and ultrasound tech says that vein is still open ..I call center for venous disease and I keep getting same answer need to wait at least a year for results! What! Ok .....now my vein is hurting more and buldging more...more varicose veins popping up.... I get these hot spots that come to the area where procedure was done last maybe 30 seconds on and off..area gets numb, hurts to stand on that leg I find myself leaning on the other leg just to avoid pain on that leg, pain where ablation was done also keeps me awake at night. I wear compression stockings did everything I was suppose to do...we are in 2013 and I am in worse pain than when I started. :( wish i never messed with my veins......"
0,Was excited about a new restaurant in gilbert close to home.  I have been to breakfast here three times lunch twice and will not be returning. Service is non existent. Food is mediocre at best. Real could be a hit if they got some management that was actually on site. I have only ever saw very young staff with no guidance and no service skills. Tragic to have a new restaurant start out this way.
0,"Made 2 appts n waited all afternoon for them then got txts saying they cant make, not wasting anymore time on this unreliable service"
0,"Had dinner there last week ...... went there with great anticipation because of its legendary status in New York ....... mildly disappointing but easily correctable .... the place itself is fun ... its old-timey Italian restaurant decor with all the celeb photos hung on wall ... very professional and most attentive service...... good food but not great ...... seems like the kitchen is trying to '' play it safe'' and the result is a very ample portion of just slightly above average entrees ...... my veal dish was good but not as good as I had hoped based on the Rao's reputation ( hype ? ) .... so they have a nice,fun setting,great servers and decent offerings but if they really got into that kitchen and tweaked their prep a bit ...... they'd improve on a product that is just a tad on the bland side. I hope they address this as it is a fun restaurant with good personnel ."
1,"This place is more like a 4.5 star. I give it a 5 star because lunch is a great price. $21 for an appetizer, main course, and desert per person...really good deal. just be aware that some items on the menu have an extra fee.\n\nSo I went here for my birthday lunch, 21st, a few weeks ago. This place is pretty cool. It is pretty high and over looks the strip, as long as you sit outside. We didnt sit outside. \n\nThe staff here is very nice and professional at the same time.\n\nOkay lets run down the menu of what me and my family had.\nI ordered:\ntomato salad, it is tomatos, olive oil, and feta cheese. Being Greek I love feta. This salad was really good, it was tasty and refreshing.\nlobster pasta. This was absolutely amazing, the best lobster I have ever had. And I used to go to New England alot because my father is from there. And this place beats any lobster I have ever had in New England.\nyogurt martini, it is yogurt in a martini glass...it is good...\n\nme dad:\nhe ordered a plate that was a bunch of \""pastes\"", to dip bread in. i tried it and it was pretty good. cant remember all of the dips though. i think one was pepper, another olive, and another hummus.\nhe had a fish plate for his main meal. i didnt try it but he liked it.\nhe had a fruit salad, which he said was tasty and fresh\n\nmy sister:\noctopus, now she actually did not eat this. me and my dad split it. she didnt like the look of the tentacles. This was amazing, the best octopus i have ever had. and i hate octopus, but love squid. it tasted like eating a really good steak.\nchicken. now this is greek style, served with greek potatoes, and pita bread. it was ok, the potatoes were good, but the chicken was americanfied. yes i know it is not a word, but basically the chicken does not have as many spices as traditional Greek chicken should.\n\noverall this place is really good and i would definitely recommend going."
1,"I suppose the combination of alcohol and pangful hunger does sometimes affect one's judgement, but as far as I can remember, the pizza I had at Deep Sea was absolutely mind blowing! \n\nSome friends and I ventured over here after a night out, and though I'm usually sceptical of pizza at such places, I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered their pepperoni, which had just the right amount of grease, cheese and yes.. pepperoni! \n\nIt's very conveniently placed as well, as there are several clubs in the vicinity. I completely understand if my judgement isn't quite trusted due to the dubious circumstances, but in my opinion there wasn't anything to complain about!"
0,"A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on \""The List\""?  Yeah, no thanks. I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff online.\n\nIf you do decide to bother with this place, call ahead. Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale.  While calling, also ask how to get put on \""The List\"", because that info isn't on their site either."
1,"Well tonight I will be going to bed early.  Thanks to the unbelievable dinner I had last night at Basil 'N Lime.  I woke up at the crack of dawn to the reminder of the delicious leftovers that were calling to me from my refrigerator.  This quaint establishment is enormous in flavor.  The fresh vegetables were saut\u00e9ed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.   To top it all off, I can sleep sounding because I know that their Garlic Beef is only a phone call away because they do deliver.  My hat's off to you, Chef Moo and your staff."
1,"So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families."
1,"Who would have thought my number one takeaway from eating here would be \""good for groups,\"" but it is! Recently, I planned a girl's day for some of my friends. We were going to do a spa party at Willow Stream but I wanted to plan a lunch before we went. Since we were going to be at the Princess, I decided to stay in-house and chose Ironwood. Initially, I booked a table on the patio overlooking the pretty pool, but when the day of the event arrived the chilly temperatures made an outdoor table obsolete. I called to change the reservation and they happily complied and told me that they had a small room off the restaurant that could hold 11. \n\nI showed up a little early and the table was already set and ready to go. I noticed that they also have a table of different fun games so I grabbed a \""Foodie Fight\"" game just in case we wanted it. Throughout the meal, the waitress was friendly, helpful and fast! She separated our tabs and before we could even blink and eye, she presented individual tabs to us at the end of the meal. It was the most seamless paying process for a group meal I've ever experience. Not to mention that the food was good too! I've eaten at the spa before and was happy to learn that they offer that menu in Ironwood in addition to their regular menu. I ordered the yogurt curry chicken lettuce wraps which were low in fat but high in flavor. Everything about the meal was lovely and I would definitely come back with a group."
0,"Went here after reading the good reviews. That was not a good decision. The food was only Ok. Not bad, but not the quality I would have expected.\n\nThe rolls were not warm which I would think they should be with the garlic and all. One was flat out cold. \n\nThe server was horrible. Didn't seem to care that we existed. I asked if there was a special and he just shouted to a coworker and came back with basically \""brocoli and something.\"" I had to finally flag him down just to ask for the check. \n\nWould not recommend."
1,Great place to relax and getaway from the vegas strip! Lots of competition near by but I was completely satisfied!
0,"If you have a childish love for hating humanity and enjoy activities like jerking a rusty butter knife across your throat cox is the ISP for you.\n\nNot only does their \""24/7\"" only work from 9-5 m-f they barely could care less if they solve the problem. I had to go to the better business bureau to finally  solve a hanging laggy internet problem. Even the BBB couldn't get a response for about 3 months. \n\nWhen it did go through I got finally a glimmer of hope in a great technician named John as he solved most of my internet problems regarding bad cables. \nJohn solved my problems temporarily but it's clear that this stellar Lieutenant on the front line cannot solve the inadequacies and leaks that stem from poor system design and just a lackluster UX. (if they even care about the end user at all)\n\nHowever no technician no matter his professionalism and great candor can stop Cox's sh**** customer service, or the fact that our internet goes to sh** when high traffic hours come on.\n\nCox is passable when you don't have issues. When one starts however, you can clearly see the cracks in their structure. My identity was stolen and a payment on my internet bill bounced due to Wells Fargo closing my account down to prevent further theft. I explained this to their CSR reps and still I have oodles of strange and weird charges on my bill. I mean why is their 2 charges for credit card and e-check denials on top of credit adjustment above it? Isn't that a little redundant to fix a charge and then charge me back for the charge I was credited back? There's a mountain of () and #'s that would make a license CPA want to scream.\n\nEven better is their automated voice system when you call in that makes you go through loopholes only to make sure to remind you at the end of their maze that they are closed. 24 hours customer service my brownie butt.  Shouldn't 1 call fix this relatively small problem instead of having to call back and check if \""Cox\"" is ready for you? \n\nOh yea I bought a new modem and router thanks to their whizes at their in store locations which is like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. You can improve your end but the likelihood that Cox holds up theirs is doubtful and will remain so until the USA changes legislation that makes ISP standard what the Asians in Korea, Japan, hell even China have today.\n\nI want to talk to the system engineers and upper management of cox? What is the business vision of cox? To spread the corporate love of a company that survives by a cartel business structure and not one of true democracy? The CEO of Cox should really contemplate where his ship is going and look deep down if he wants to be the caretaker of a customer service/business model that most Cash-Advance Loan Sharks wouldn't touch\n\nIt's digusting that the only other option in my neighborhood is cox or shaky looking century link dsl connection.    \n\nSo yeah if you have 99 problems and your downright darius about becoming a centurion go ahead and sign Cox up as your ISP provider."
1,"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tokyo House. I've been frequenting this establishment since I was weaned off my mother's nipple. All the time, people ask me: \""How'd you grow to be so tall and handsome?\"" I don't tell them that it was genetics. I tell them that it was all the good eatin' at Tokyo House.\n\nMy mom told me that when I was born my head was four times larger than my body, and because of my explosive bouts of infantile diarrhea, I wasn't able to gain weight. In layman terms, my head-to-body ratio was way out of whack, and it started creating all sorts of health problems. The doctor said that my huge head was consuming so many calories that it destroyed my immune system and put the rest of my body in a state of malnutrition. He told my poor mother that I only had two weeks before my head consumed my little limbs. Thirteen days after the doctor's diagnosis, I looked like a pink balloon on a limp string (the string being my last identifiable extremity, if you know what I mean.) My string started receding into my head like a toddler sucking up a wet spaghetti noodle. My mother thought that it was the end for me. She didn't know a better way to send me out of this cruel world than to serve me a proper last supper. She drove us to Tokyo House, ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, whispered her goodbyes to me, and stuffed my head with that magical food. \n\nI owe my life to Tokyo House. It's because of them (and the awesome Asian man at the front register) that I'm alive today."
1,"My better half and I came here for dinner during restaurant week and were pleasantly surprise that there wasn't a wait for a table. We were also lucky enough to have visited on half price bottle of wine night, which in my book equals buy one get one free!\nOur server was very friendly and attentive and helped us navigate the menu and figure out how much we should order so that we didn't have left overs, which we didn't because everything was delicious! \nThe ambiance was intimate and inviting and I absolutely love the handcrafted chandelier that added an artist, warm lighting.\nDear Fern, I will be back for more!"
1,"I've been going to Cafe Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant for many years now. Tonight's experience reminds me of my very first time here 12 years ago when my wife and I flew into Sky Harbor Airport late in the evening to visit Phoenix for a job interview. We were very hungry but couldn't find a place to sit and eat. We spotted this Ethiopian restaurant (in a strip mall of all places, we thought!) and decided to try it out. As we walked up to the entrance, we saw that Cafe Lalibela was closing for the evening (it was about 9 pm). In defeat, we turned to walk back toward our rental car, but the owner saw us and urged us to come in!  Mind you there were diners finishing their meals. Clearly we were going to keep them late. The owner and staff never minded though and we had an amazing meal. \n\nWe now live in Phoenix and ever since that night, we bring nearly everyone who visits us from out of town to Cafe Lalibela after picking them up from the airport. Universally they are pleased with the food and friendliness and ask to return on subsequent visits to Phoenix.\n\nTonight, I brought my parents, who just arrived in Phoenix to visit us, to Cafe Lalibela and found that the restaurant was closing early for the evening. The manager saw us looking at the 'Closed' sign and invited us in. He explained they had such a busy day today (a very favorable review in today's Arizona Republic will do that, apparently) that they ran out of several dishes, only had gluten-free injera bread left, and decided to close early. He explained that as long as this was okay he'd be pleased to have us dine here tonight. We were treated \""like honored guests\"" as my dad noted and our meal was fantastic, as usual.\n\nCafe Lalibela is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix."
1,the food was good and had very nice presentation.\nwe had: \nmezza combo\nsteak and hummus\nfried kebbeh\nmakanek\nfalafel\nmossaka\n\nits more expensive than what i thought it would be.
1,"I'm not typically a breakfast kind of guy, but occasionally I get a craving for breakfast foods. Whenever I get this craving, U.S. Egg is my go-to place. The half-and-half breakfast is the best of both worlds, you get a great egg and potato skillet plus their awesome protein pancakes."
0,"Disappointing...no heat in the room, pet stains on the carpet, sink backed up....and no one answered the phone when I tried to report these issues. On the other hand, as mentioned below, Steve the bartender continues to provide an exemplary level of service that used to be the norm at the Crescent."
0,"My wife were in town from Denver and are both Celiacs so finding a place with decent gluten free food is tough while on the road. Vitamin T was one of our few options. Phoenix needs to step it up with GF food offerings. \n\nFirst, the positives: I wasn't expecting much, but the food was actually pretty good. The carne asada and barbacoa tacos were very tasty and weren't heavy and greasy like a lot of Mexican food. \n\nIf it weren't for the service, I would have given Vitamin T 4-5 stars. My wife was here for a conference and we decided eat here on a Saturday. The place was packed with people from the conference and when we walked in they were 20 orders behind. There were four guys working but only one was working his ass off. Another wasn't helping with the orders, one was moving very slow and left while we were waiting, and the third was totally clueless. On top of that, they screwed up our order by giving us flour tortillas (which we can not have), even though we requested corn several times while ordering. \n\nBy the time we got our food, we had waited an hour. If they aren't busy, I would recommend it. Otherwise, just go to Chipotle where they're much more efficient with four people."
0,"This place is the inferior version of Wazuzu. Their service is TERRIBLE!  The waiter forgot to bring our Dim Sum order. When he finally returned to our table and I informed him of that, he told me that I hadn't ordered it. Yep! The waiter called me a liar and gave no semblance of concern. No \""sorry about the mix up\"" or \""I will get your order\"".  Seriously people?  This place is kind of expensive. You would expect much better. \n\nDo yourself a favor. If you want high-quality Asian food, go to Wazuzu at the Encore. The experience will actually be worth the price."
1,"Pizza Cat admits she likes this chain. \n\nYes, you can even find CPK in the FREEZER SECTION AT WALMART, but that's because it's good and Pizza Cat cannot turn down good food. \n\nPizza Cat had grown up on CPK as a kitten, so as newer, faster, leaner pizza places cropped up, CPK was thrown to the side. Full-disclosure: Pizza Cat admits a lot of the food she will review, she has tasted over the last decade. But she recently had their new California Flatbreads, which were delicious. \n\nPizza Cat got their Spicy Fennel Sausage with Poblano Chiles Flatbread and their Bianco Flatbread (truffle cream, gorgonzola, mozza and fresh sage). Both were delicious. The Poblano chiles they used did not taste like chile rellenos. Instead, they were thin, strips, almost shavings of the chile. It had a bite, the combination of the cheese, oregano and chile was extraordinary. As was the combination of gorgonzola and fresh sage. Who said CPK had lost their touch? They may have become corporate, but they still have their creative flair. \n\nPizza Cat was glad to see they kept many of their long-time favorites on the menu. She recommends their Sedona Tortilla soup and Dakota Smashed pea soup. Unbelievably good. \n\nPizza Cat says their original BBQ chicken pizza is good  and so is their Thai Chicken Pizza and/or Thai Crunch salad. Her favorite is the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza that comes with chilled field greens on top. \n\nUnfortunately, their \""ordinary\"" pizzas are not as good. *shrugs*\n\nService was less than stellar, it was on par to what she'd find at Chipotle. \n\nBut food is still tasty and prices are reasonable and it's located in a convenient location. \n\nCan't say no to that!"
1,One of the best pizzas I've tried. Italian and Sicilian pizza highly recommended. If u like cheese pizza try their white pizza! Bomb!
1,"We love this Snip Its! The friendly staff makes the place- my 5 year old loves the games, movies and the prize machine at the end! They always do a wonderful job and we've never had to wait long since they are staffed well all of the time. The products are wonderful too- Morning Miracle is my savior!"

0,"Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \""grunge\"" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all."
1,"Free entrance,  free champagne all night for ladies,huka section, dance section, and 2 bars. The rooms are dark and sexy. What more could you ask for?  Enough said.\n\nHOWEVER, 2 well drinks=$26 bucks. ouch!"
0,Can't really comment because I came on normal business hours and at normal time at 4pm and they were closed no sign no nothing . Kinda disappointing.
1,Fresh Vegan (cold raw food). Great taste and creativity. I had the Pad Thai and it was delicious. Only it didn't taste anything like real Pad Thai. Nice beer choices. Juices and other 'healthy' beverages are expensive.  All in all I would go again and I recommend you all to try it.
0,Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!
1,"Taking the bus in this land o'suburban sprawl gives me the holier-than-thou glee that I can only imagine born-again Christians must feel when looking down on my sorry soulless ass. \n\nReally. It's awesome. You can check out routes at http://tempe.gov/tim/Bus/Orbit.htm or http://www.valleymetro.org/Default.asp. \n\nI take the Jupiter, which runs near my house and drops me a few blocks from the office. And despite others' experiences, it's only been sketch-city once, when I would have sworn a methadone clinic was on my route. \n\nUsually, it's just ASU students, kooky old professors in orthopedic shoes and a couple teenagers skipping class. And me, the pseudoprofessional sorta grown-up.\n\nHonestly, I am the scariest person on the bus most days. For serious.\n\nThere's just one drawback, which I'm even loathe to mention, given my far-too-earnest desire to have you join me on my route. But alas.\n\nThe fucking bus. Won't run. On time.\n\nMaybe it's cuz I'm German as all get-out, but I expect the damn thing to approximate a schedule. And, you know, if there's a construction detour, it should take the detour consistently, or not at all. \n\nBut I'm still giving those adorable little blue buses four stars, in the hopes that you'll give it a shot. \n\nIt's not bad, I promise. Plus, I really want y'all to support some proposed service expansions, like extending the hours on weekends to midnight or even 2:00 am.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, I'm just a drunk looking for a free ride home...and some moral high ground."

The hostesses are sweet and welcoming, and our servers are attentive and always give our two young ones a cookie. And the food- consistently on point!  (I recommend the Cabo Skillet.) Lovey also makes her rounds in the morning and greets customers to see how the food is; There is definitely a sense of pride that can be seen in the restaurant and tasted in the delicious dishes."
1,"If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity."
1,"Tavern 245 is one of our regular happy hour spots. Modern vibe to it but the chairs/sofas are still pretty comfortable. And as one expects in a Pgh bar, TV's so you can watch sports. Specials are good, the bartenders are friendly and while it gets busy for happy hour, it's not too crowded. It may feel a little hazardous getting down the stairs when you've had one too many but I haven't heard any reports of accidents so it's really not that bad;)\n\nFor lunch, I've only been once; got a burger which was pretty good. Prices are very decent for downtown. Make sure to get here a little early for lunch as the service is a little slow once they get busy (a sentiment also confirmed by coworkers who've gone more often). I certainly wouldn't mind coming back for lunch again."
1,Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.
0,"This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."
0,My chicken parm was okay. But my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing. My Aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars. I would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is. Having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score
0,"Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders."
0,Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game.
1,"I wish I could give them MORE than 5 stars!  They do ONE thing.  Chicken. and they do it BRILLIANTLY.  The Texas toast is amazing, I always end up stealing my husband's toast from his order.\n\nWhen I moved to Vegas from San Diego, I was sad at leaving Chic-Fil-A behind.  No longer does I haz a sad.  ;)\n\nStaff are friendly, cheerful and HELPFUL.  Place is always immaculate, and there's always at least one person in the lobby area busing tables and wiping things down.\n\nSweet Tea - don't pass it up, it's awesome.\n\nAnd to the one critical review I see below, may I say that if scads of people are saying it's great, and YOU happen to not agree... well perhaps it's YOUR perception that's off?  You mentioned being there late at night - perhaps your perceptions were \""chemically altered\""?  :)\n\nAnyway - amazing, amazing, and terrific.  Don't miss it!  :D"
1,"Pork on a Fork is an unexpected awesome BBQ place in the north valley.  If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers \""N\"" on the smoker and picture of windmills & farmers in the dining area.  To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place.  No points lost though.\n\nI have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early.  Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it.\n\nTheir sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce. The dining areas have flat screen TV's and aren't bad, but the chairs and tables are picnic quality."
1,"Great selection of beers from a variety of micro-breweries. We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)"
1,"this place is amazing. if you are vegan, GET HERE. the donuts taste better than i remember. the glazed are obviously the best, but any of them will do. top two rows are vegan. if you are in las vegas DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE!"
1,"I've been coming to see Jen Botto for about a year now and she is just fantastic, she does my cuts and my highlights. She is the most efficient stylist when it come to highlights. I would recommend her to anyone, especially if you are looking for a modern or up-to-date haircut. She's always able to give me exactly what I want, and I can be pretty picky some times."
0,"I was given a prepaid detail as a gift. I made my appointment, took my White truck to be detailed. They called me a few hours later and said it was ready to be picked up. I inspected my truck when I got home, I only live a mile from this location; my truck looked horrible. Wheel wells-not cleaned(still had dirt in them), bed of the truck-not clean(still had dirt in it), tires-looked terrible due to whatever the slime was that they sprayed on them, interior- don't even think it got vacuumed(found a peanut and white dog hair, I have a black dog that I do not let ride in my truck), they left spots on my floormats from where they cleaned one spot(didn't clean the entire mat), my dash was covered in that nasty slime, & my rearview mirror and visor mirror still had fingerprints on them. All that isn't the worst part, the thing that made this a horrible place to get a detail is that they had actually managed to Swirl a WHITE truck. How do you swirl a white truck? I would hate to see what they would have done had I taken in a dark colored vehicle. I even found bugs on the front of my truck, I only live a mile away; I couldn't have gotten that many bugs from the drive home. I won't even go back for a carwash. I'm not sure how much was paid for my detail, but I do know that the person that paid for it got robbed."
1,"I have been to a lot of Starbucks and I thought this Starbucks was really clean and it was pretty big inside too.  This year I got a free drink for my birthday.  I was pretty excited about it, because Starbucks is one of my favorite places to go for coffee.  So, when I went up to order my Chocolate Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.  The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup."
0,"OK, so we stumbled upon this place on a sleepy Sunday morning. I was so happy to see it, we were starving. Note: There are NO breakfast places along Shea Blvd....\n\nI didn't even notice the \""all local organic\"" thingy till we got inside. Nice I like that.\n\nI did notice a disgusting sewer smell. No, it was not eggs. Just as I was thinking \""maybe its me\"" a toddler voice shouted \""Mommy it stanks in here\"" Toddlers don't lie. It did stink.\n\nAs I prayed whatever it was that stunk would go away, I pondered the menu. Not extensive but alright: eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes.\n\nThe stink did come and go, thank gawd it wasn't constant, I wouldn't have been able to handle that.\n\nI got the freshly squeezed OJ and it was great. I also ordered the French Toast. It sounded interesting as they use sourdough. Weird, right? It was weird. Not a fan of the sourness going through it. But it was nicely griddled and the syrup and delicious scoop of whipped butter helped. The eggs and bacon( a bit skimpy tho) on the side were very good, as were the hashbrowns I ordered on the side.\n\nHubs had the Popeye omelet, and my bite was very tasty.\n\nAll in all, a good place to go, but they really need to fix that sewer problemo."
1,"Seems like a blast from the past... The servers are truly career waitresses making them honest and probably the best you'll ever find. The food was QUICK tasty and correct. . Getting food how you order it has some sort of perk, especially if your expected to pay for it. I would make the drive for another treat, though based on the wait and capacity on a Friday morning i would not dare a Saturday morning visit. . BUT, if your in the area, defiantly walk across the parking lot for a pedicure.. great little business complex they have over there. . A++"
0,"If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?"
1,"I recently had a \""cupcake cake\"" made here for my son's 4th birthday... Every year i try to have a very unique cake.  Went in with an idea for an ocean/beach setting and the owner knew exactly what I was trying to accomplish!  It turned out beautiful!  Absolutely perfect, and ALL the cupcakes were so fresh and moist.... Best part was the unbelievable price!  We were able to pick a variety of cupcakes to make the 32 for the cake... (which choice is important for 4 yr olds:)  Custom, and fresh are not usually affordable!\nThank u so much, the cupcakes were a huge hit!"
0,"I feel hungover and the guilt of being underage just by walking by this place.  Unless I'm super drunk to begin with, I'm probably not venturing in.\n\nOn another note, I gave this a second star because I hear they have (or used to have) a stock market pricing system where drinks cost more or less based on demand.  It's the only way I've ever really understood the economy, and that combined with the fact that they serve alcohol, merits two proud stars."
1,"fantasies of you are inspiring me to finish my phd proposal that will be the only hope of our reunion. \n\nplease don't change. except maybe you could get more tables. and do delivery. and revamp the toilets. \n\nbut nothing else.\n\n if i don't get accepted, or funding,  i will be your US rep and together we will conquer a country of generally mediocre indian food. \nxxoo"
0,The high roller is at the end of a trendy row of casino and clubs. It's geared toward a younger crowd and has an outdoor club feel. The night time ride is $37 a person. It was not an amazing view since you see the parking lot in the rear of the area for most of the ride. There is a person who CEOs on the screen and explains what height your at and does a apex countdown. I would go once to say you've done it but it's not as fun as the bars on the ground.
1,"Cuginos is a great place to stop for some good italian food. I usually do just the Pizza slice combo which is two slices of pizza and drink for 5 bucks. The pizza is pretty spot on every time. I have had better in Vegas, but its right up there in my top 5 or so. They also make great salads and sandwiches. The staff is always friendly to us when we go in. If you go in, ask Donnie if you can try a piece of their fresh homemade mozzarella. Its the best Mozzarella i have honestly ever had."
1,"Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs."
0,I was there in the afternoon on December 31. Someone took a sharp object to the side of my car and the rear panel. They did $1200 in damage. Called Harkins and wasn't even told by manager that he was sorry. Had to write Harkins to even get an apology.
0,"The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go."
1,"Tasty.  Nice, sit down Mexican food place with very friendly service.  Lots of options available including veggie.  Somewhat outdated interior, but still pleasant.  Kudos to the server that got us a fresh chips and salsa refill BEFORE we asked for it.\n\nSignificantly better than your average Mexican joint.  Closed on Sundays."
1,"Our new favorite ice cream spot! With kronuts!!  Super friendly service, very clean place and very accommodating to our kids who wanted to sample all kinds of flavors.  And their recommendations were on point!  Happy customer who'll be coming back for more!"
0,Horrible service is an understatement.  Everything wrong. Lower your standards?
1,"Visited the Shiloh on a Sunday evening before things started getting busy. This is a friendly unpretentious place that is inviting.   It was too cool to enjoy the deck dining. The offering of craft beer on the menu were plentiful, but sadly the two my man wanted had kicked and there was no back up.  He found a third to try, but really wanted his first pick.  Guess the weekend got ahead of them, and when you are out, you are out.  I was happy they serve Kaliber non alcohol beer which is my favorite.  The menu isn't large but offers a interesting selections.  We ordered the cheese balls and WOW are they delicious.  This isn't your ordinary mozzarella cheese stick like balls.  The waiter said the cheese is made locally and had a soft, salty and tangy bite.  I enjoyed the pork tacos that were so good I would have them again.  My man had the hamburger advertised as one of the best in Pittsburgh - he agrees."
1,At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family.
1,"I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\""s just an okay place with good food"
1,"Ok I've been here about 10 or more times and I still love Rudy's the same as I first tasted them in Austin a few years ago. This place rules! Get the choice cut of brisket and try some smoked turkey and throw in a half link while your add it. You won't be disappointed. I've never been!  Overall my favorite BBQ here in Phx until I can be proven wrong. If this is not the best one in Phx, then it's one of them in almost everyone's list. I love Rudy's!"
0,Worst place to rent a home Haven Homes is not a good property management.  I have had problems with a leaking shower have a hole in my ceiling in my kitchen My oven doesn't work I have called them it has been over a month and still nothing ridiculous.  I have worked in this type of business I will make sure other renters know about them before they rent from them.
1,Good American food. Beer is pricey though.
0,"FRESH?? No. Completely misleading. I went there on my last trip to LV, and i was looking for some fresh, healthy food in between the bar runs. I got the Chinese Chicken Salad. Sounds healthy enough, no? Comes out looking great. Until I cut into the \""chicken\"". It is not at all \""Fresh\"" or even real looking. It was that fake, press board chicken like product you get in Mcdonalds salads. It's CHICKEN people. The cheapest meat on the market!!! I'm not saying it has to be organic, but it should be REAL CHICKEN BREAST!!! Not fattening packaged crap! I threw all the chicken out, ate the salad, and did not return. You should avoid this place. There are too many amazing places to eat at Miracle Mile/PH..."
0,"I like the discounts they seem to have all the time and I like all the children's crafts but this place is very dirty.  I went on a Saturday around 11:00AM and the bathroom was disgusting.  There was no toliet paper, garbage overflowing on on the floor and there was no soap.  Normally a place like this you would think they would check the bathroom each other but who knows if they even clean this every day.  I did bring this to their attention when I checked out."
0,My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.
1,This is a beautiful place to see the seasonal themes change.  It's a living breathing art exhibit.  I absolutely love walking around the conservatory and seeing all the incredible colors used in nature for humanities viewing pleasure. \nI try to go at least four times a year. \n\nAfter you see the gardens walk outside and watch the fountains for an even better experience.
0,"I am giving this 2 stars because of the nightclub.  I probably would have given 3 or maybe even 4 for dinner. \n\nDinner: Obviously expensive.  We had reservations and still waited 20 minutes.  Maybe this is normal in Vegas but I thought it was crazy when they make you make the reservation, give your credit card number, and then call the day of to confirm. Hello, we are going to come.  My husband and I had the duck and really liked it.  They lure you in by saying you get a wristband for the club if you eat there, but don't tell you that you must purchase a $40-$50 entree to get that band. Service was mediocre.  In all, the food was satisfying. But go for the expensive food, not to get into the night club. \n\nNightclub: awful.  If 500 people left, it may have been fun.  You couldn't move, and not in a good way.  It was uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all.  The bartenders were rude.  It took minimum 20 minutes to get a drink.  The drinks were minimum $14. We left after 30 minutes (maximum).  Veryyyy disappointing."
1,"This place was great.  Very friendly atmosphere and attentive service.  The servers just kept coming and you didn't have to wait too long if you needed something.  If they don't personally have what you're looking for, the server will go and look for the person who can deliver.\n\nDon't forget to try out the Lobster Bisque... it is heaven.\n\nJust make sure that you have enough room to chow down and enough time to really savor the meal."
0,"Wow what a disappointment... We stooped in for some lunch and my wife ordered the meatball sandwich and I grabbed a burger and her mother had the chicken entree, first off the burger was dry and i didn't enjoy anything about it, very over priced for mediocre food to say the least, my wife's meatball sandwich was spicy and that wasn't ever in the description, my mother in laws chicken was dry and the bed of whatever it was severed on was just weird, bad food for outrageous prices.\nI didn't care for our server either, she was very snooty..."
0,"After over two years, I finally returned to Wicked Spoon. On my first visit, I wasn't a fan of the small plates concept, but on this occasion that was the least of my complaints. \n\nMy friend was in town and wanted to try a buffet. We were leaning towards Bacchanal, but my fella insisted on giving Wicked Spoon another try since we weren't really in the mood to stand in a long line for dinner. We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday and there was no line at all. I have to admit, this scared me off a bit. This is peak buffet-eating time and there was no line, it just didn't seem right. \n\nWe paid and were seated within 2 minutes of arriving. Service was friendly, but we had to wait quite a bit of time to get drink orders in. On several occasions I had to ask other servers that were meandering around if we could order drinks and refills. After this coaxing our server did arrive and take our orders. We made sure to order refills as he was placing our drinks down after having to wait one too many times with nothing to drink. As a thirsty girl, that's a pet peeve of mine, keep those refills coming.\n\nThe food wasn't too exciting either. I actually had a hard time deciding on anything. I wandered around around much longer than I usually do at buffets and ended up with the same things over and over. The only things I had any interest in eating were the kalbi and assorted veggies I found on the line.\n\nI don't see myself returning to this buffet any time soon. Definitely not worth the $40 price tag."
1,"Absolutely fantastic !!!!! From the environment, the staff and the food, the gnocchi melt on your mouth. As you can see by my plate, I could have ate another dinner."
0,Watered down iced coffee and stale donuts.
0,"Went here with my dad and cousin. We waited 30 minutes outside. I thought to myself, \""heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!\"" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. \nMy cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.\n You get the gist.\n\nAside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.\nMaybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake. \n\nThe only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area."
1,"I was at my wits end trying to harness the energy of my Vizsla puppy Finnegan.  He was literally bouncing off the walls and various pieces of furniture in my house.  I was seriously in need of my own personal dog whisperer.  A client who owns two Bull Mastiffs highly recommended Team Canine to me, and after a one-on-one training session at my house, I will happily recommend them to all of you in Yelpdom.  Their training techniques are based on positive reinforcement and a true understanding of dog psychology.  They have group classes in addition to the personal training.  I am definitely going to enroll in the group obedience class."
1,"We were exploring the city and decided to stop in...we opted for the roof top seating and loved it.  Food, service and drinks were all GREAT!!!  The roof top seating was fun!!!  It was a great time!"
1,"I like this place. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot. It's a Charlotte institution, and the food is very good. The only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft... not thick as expected. Still good."
0,"For those of you, who know the Valley, you probably have a good idea how far Goodyear is from Mesa  (for those of you not familiar, think San Francisco to Los Angeles ... LOL).  Nevertheless, we were prepared to run the gauntlet of rush hour traffic, crazy weekend drivers and take an overnight bag with us to try out this restaurant with spectacular reviews.  And once again, the Valley's populace has NOT let me down:  apparently, only ex-cons who suffered with prison food and people who've lost their sense of taste (both physical and mental) give 4 and 5 stars on Yelp to ANYTHING.\n\nFirst, let me say, that this restaurant's employees couldn't do more to make your dining experience a pleasant one:  they're friendly, very attentive and respond quickly to any request you could throw at them.  \n\nI haven't seen many Indian restaurants, which serve buffets at night, so I was curious to see how this place stacked up against other Indian places I've been to.  The decor is ... interesting.  From the ground level to about 7 feet up, the decor is homey and reminds you of Cheers-gone-Diner.  Above 7 feet, the decor can best be described as \""condemned factory\"".  But okay ... while decor is important in enjoying your meal, it's not necessarily a deal breaker ... if the food makes up for it.  Sadly, this is not the case.  While I give the restaurant overall two stars, I would specifically rate the food as  \""two-flushes\""  (figure it out, if you dare!).  I'm sorry, but this just happens to be one of those places that support my argument against low-flow toilets.  It's not that the food looks unappetizing; it's just that, well, it IS:  oversalted food; dry tandoori chicken; thin-sauce chicken tikki masala (and that was the BEST dish).  The na'an was okay ... actually, I liked it because it's thick; my other half likes the na'an thin and crispy.  Funny enough, the place was absolutely packed  (no doubt only with people who could prove they usually give at least 4 stars on their Yelp reviews).  \n\nI really wanted to give this place a stellar review, not the least, because its employees are top notch.  Unfortunately, when you come home to go to the bathroom after dinner and your dog runs away yelping with his tail between his legs, there's not much else to say.\n\nTruly sorry, guys."
0,Terrible customer service. High prices. Careless employees inside and out. I won't be back!
1,"How lazy can you get? I made reservations on the Yelp app on OpenTable and it is a stones throw from our hotel room. I told my husband to choose somewhere to eat for his belated birthday and he chose Fiamma. \n\nI love the decor. I love chic places. It was also nice to see a little reception dinner for a newly married couple. I've always contemplated a Vegas wedding. The tab would be under a grand. Nice! Anyway, dinner was awesome. The hostess brought us to our table pretty quickly and they even accommodated us when we wanted to move to a booth. The server jokingly said \""no PDA but under the table stuff is fine\"". It was really romantic. A nice getaway from Christmas craziness. We ordered cocktails. The hubs had the Fiamma \""The Original\"" and I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The drinks were pretty tasty. Order the Caprese to share. When I order Caprese I don't expect much but some buffalo mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. When the salad came out it was colorful. Chopped up yellow and red tomatoes, strips of basil, and soft buffalo mozzarella and some awesome tasty green sauce. I ordered the Raviolini which is amazing shortrib ravioli with black truffle goodness. It was super good as the pasta was al dente. My husband ordered the Orecchiette. Both of our entrees were good tasting and totally worth it. Prior to dinner we told the server where we were from and that we were celebrating my husband's birthday (even it was a week before). We ordered the Crocchette for dessert which were little donuts made of Amaretto and Ricotta and dipping sauce. The server was so nice he brought us out glasses of champagne and even made a little Happy Birthday display with a candle for my hubs.\n\nThe service was top notch and our server was super personable. He was really attentive to us even when the restaurant was close to closing. Overall experience was fabulous. If you have a hard time deciding on the millions of restaurants to eat at in Vegas and feel like Italian, come to MGM and try it out. Pricey but totally worth the food quality, ambiance, and service."
1,"yummaaaaaaay....open till midnight! Chill outside on the patio at night, or during the day if its not 110 degrees. Fresh veggies, tasty blue cheese dip. Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient."
0,"I have loved this Fry's since it reopened last year.  I spend a lot of money here.  My last shopping experience was disappointing and frustrating.  I got home missing several items.  This is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this store.  When I talk to anyone in the store (most recently an asst. manager) about this there are no apologies.  All 3 times were like this.  \nA while ago, I purchased shrimp at Safeway and got it home to find it was spoiled, I returned to the store and the manager replaced double the shrimp and refunded my money.  Now, that's customer service.\nFry's may offer good prices but you can't put a price tag on good customer service."
0,"Horrible experience!! Service is slow and food is not properly cooked. I order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold. This restaurant does not provide fine dining, I do not recommend this restsurant to anyone."
1,"I've been eating at Saigon Palace for about 10 years now. When I worked in the South Park area, I usually went once a week.\n\nThe pho is consistently very very good. I have had many different variations and they have all been wonderful. I can truthfully say that I have never had anything but excellent service and excellent food.\n\nThe owner and her staff are always friendly and nice. If the owner is at the restaurant when I visit, she never fails to speak to me and make sure my meal was good.\n\nAfter a long stint of working at home I am now working in south Charlotte again. I'm glad I can visit one of my favorite restaurants again on a regular basis!"
0,"Worst service ever!  Came in at 9:20pm and as soon as we walked in the manager told us take out only!  I asked why when it clearly states on the door they don't close until 10:00.  He told me it's because he wanted to get out early.  WHAT THE FUCK?!?  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.  So rude.  He even chuckled as he said it.  Going to call the owner tomorrow, but honestly if he hired someone like this to manage his restaurant I'd be surprised if he even cared."
0,"Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."
0,"This review is for the minute clinic-\nDo not come here!! Go somewhere, anywhere else.\nI caught the flu so I checked online to see there was no wait time at this location. Checked in and the computer said it would be a 10-15 minute wait. No problem... Well after 30 minutes, some lady calls me up front to tell me they cant see me because they close at 5:30 and the doctor will not stay past closing. So frustrating. I ended up going to UMC instead."
0,"My girlfriend took her 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser in to get the Valve Cover gasket replaced, and the shop said the vehicle was too high off the ground to work on the engine. So they removed the tires to lower the vehicle and then rested it on the brake rotors. My girlfriend almost had a heart attack when she saw that. Then they split the cold air intake tube and said for $200 they could replace it. We both have Toyota Land Cruisers and we will never return to this shop."
1,"This is one of my favorite Starbucks - not that I drink at any Starbucks particularly often. The location is a big plus, and the workers are always friendly. They are efficient as well - they have to be, considering how much traffic this store gets. If you walk in and see a bit of a line, just know that it tends to move fairly quickly."
1,A great place to pick up your snack and beverage essentials for your room.  Don't forget to pick up bottles of waters so you can stay hydrated after a day of drinking!
0,"Horrible stay. Decided to stay here after surgery to recover and relax. Awful beds! I slept worse here than in the hospital! Upgraded to a nicer room upon check in, but I reaped zero benefits from that. Called the front desk multiple times to get reg. coffee for the coffee maker and they told me that I needed to go to the restaurant if I wanted that. They never replaced the toilet paper in the room so i resorted to using kleenex. The hotel claims to be a 4 star establishment, but in actuality it is just a spoofed up motel. I will never stay here again and I am beyond disappointed by this establishment and the staff!"
1,"Thanks to being one of the lucky winners of two-day passes to the recent Formula Drift event, I got to spend two evenings at the speedway.  It had been a very long time since my last visit; probably 8 years.  During my last visit my awesome physics teacher in high school had us all come to the speedway and learn about acceleration the fun way: through drag racing!  Remember to bring your earplugs if you come for this!\n\nFor the Formula Drift event, the speedway was far from reaching capacity.  Plenty of parking was available, as well as seating during the event.  Spectators are able to watch from the fence (and consequently covered in rubber from the drifters!) or sit on the bleachers.  The restrooms were not too packed, and had both soap and paper towels; this can be rare during public events!  There were also several food and drink vendors which, as could be expected, were a bit pricey.  Water was $4, iced tea $8, shaved ice $5, beer $1...yep, somehow beer was the cheapest beverage!\n\nI'm not too involved in motor events, so I can't say that I'll be returning here anytime soon.  I also find this a hard place to rate, as I didn't really make much use of the venue outside of the restrooms.  But here's four stars, for an easily accessible and exitable speedway within Las Vegas."
0,"Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware"
0,"VERY disappointing. This used to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood but the quality of the food and service has gone WAY downhill recently. The elephant garlic appetizer is still decent but most everything else has changed for the worse. I used to LOVE the carne adovada but now its just a small portion of pulled pork in a lame red sauce. (the carne adovada at Four Peaks in Tempe remains my absolute favorite). I grew up on New Mexican cuisine and fell in love with Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos when I moved here 13 years ago. Up until recently, Secreto was a contender. After the embarrassment of taking out of town clients there last week for terrible food and service, I'll never go there again."
1,"Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all."
0,"I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings - even from people with many reviews.  I've driven by here many times and knew from my Yelp app it had good ratings.  However, I was a little hesitant to come here because most of the people whose reviews I follow and deem reliable did not give this place a good rating.  Should have listened to them.  \n\nBasically, the food is not very good.  It's NOT bad...but it's not even average for a breakfast place.\n\nI had country fried steak and eggs.  The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium) and the CFS was just bad.  Bland, tough, and the gravy served on top was really thick and useless.  It was small, too.  Came with a biscuit -  bland, chewy, and dense.  \n\nI'm not accusing the folks who run Norms of successfully manipulating people into giving it a high rating.  I have no proof of that.  But, yeah, that's what they did.  I'd bet plenty of dough on it.  Good for them, I guess.\n\nThere's literally 30+ places within 10 minute drive from here that are loads better for breakfast.  And the price isn't really cheap, either.  Looks like they raised prices above what they used to be.\n\nI really feel like giving this 1 star for the fact that so many reviews from before were not accurate or biased.  But I don't know for sure so I'll give it a deuce."
1,This show was pretty great though I loved Zumanity even better (see review). I was staying with family at the Wynn so we splurged for tickets to La Reve. The acrobatics were really phenomenal and the dives into the gorgeous pools of water were amazing too. The show seemed to try to have a bit of a plot but the excitement and beauty of the acrobatics far out-weighed my interest in the story line. \n\nThey seemed to plan the seating extremely well for this show so that basically every seat in the house is a good seat. \n\nI don't think you can EVER go wrong with a Cirque de Soleil show! I definitely want to catch them all!!!
0,Extremely disorganized and unprofessional place!  If you have time to waste this is your place.
0,"Called about a fuel leak on my cts. The service advisor didn't want to look up my information to tell me if my car had warranty coverage, and didn't want to even listen to my problem. He just kept cutting me off mid sentence saying \""get it into me\"" and gave me the impression he didn't want to be on the phone. He also told me they would not have a replacement car for me to use while they serviced my cts. After I got off the phone I opted to take the cts to Findlay Cadillac instead even though its much further from my house and I had a great experience there. See my review for them if your Caddi needs service."
1,"Very good sushi! I think I have found a sushi place to frequent regularly now! Everything was very fresh and creative. It seems if you like spicy sushi, this may be a place for you, but don't worry it's not all spicy, they just have some great things to try that are spicy. The sushi chef at the bar was friendly too! This place is in walking distance of my place so I am definitely going to try their 5-7pm happy hour soon. It is located right on lakeside property so you can also have a romantic dinner outside overlooking the lake, but probably want to save that for this fall :)"
0,"Mauvaise exp\u00e9rience de A \u00e0 Z. Est-ce parce que nous \u00e9tions un groupe? Les commentaires sont pourtant positifs pour ce resto. Premi\u00e8rement, la serveuse ne nous \u00e0 pas offert de l'eau du robinet et nous \u00e0 tout de suite d\u00e9poser des bouteilles d'eau de source \u00e0 6$ la bouteille. Le confit de carnard est-il bon ? Je ne sais pas, car apr\u00e8s l'avoir command\u00e9, la serveuse nous revient en nous informant qu'il n'en restait plus. En parlant de la serveuse, robe courte, dos d\u00e9couvert, talons hauts et service d'une pr\u00e9tention indescriptible. Nous \u00e9tions un groupe d'environ 15 convives. Nous sentions que nous d\u00e9rangions et la courtoisie \u00e9tait absente. Si vous ne voulez pas de groupe, refuser les plut\u00f4t que de nous donner un service aussi mauvais. \u00c0 la fin du repas, la serveuse apporte une seule facture pour les 15 et refuse de la diviser parmi les couples. Il fallait aviser la personne qui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 qu'une seule facture serait faite, ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas. Ils n'ont finalement pas eu le choix de faire des factures individuelles s'ils voulaient \u00eatre pay\u00e9s. C'est un resto pour voir et \u00eatre vu et dont je n'ai pas pu appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 l'exp\u00e9rience culinaire. Un jour peut-\u00eatre j'y retournerai mais plus jamais en groupe."
1,"I dont know if its the quality of the food, the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here, but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co. know what the hell they're doing! This place is awesome and if you've never been...get off your ass and check it out!\n\nGrowing up in Michigan, the pasty is somewhat of a local food (by way of English immigrants). If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome. Simple, traditional and good. \n\nThe staff is friendly, helpful and colorful! Check out the juke box witch contains mostly, if not all British bands. Just another nice touch.\n\nAhhh a Pasty and a Pint! Life is good."
0,"This was a nightmare of a visit. Let me tell you how it started a catastrophe but ended on a slightly positive note. \n\nThe wife and I were very excited to be in Phoenix, Az. We were in town for a roof-top wedding at a nearby venue. As we pulled up, I saw that the hotel offered valet parking. Due to the fact the underground parking structure was too far, we chose to utilize valet.  \n\nThe valet experience was a nightmare. I parked my car in the line of vehicles waiting on valet service. The wife and I exited the vehicle and began to gather our belongings. I looked up and saw no vehicles in front of us indicating we were next. WRONG!\n\nI looked up and saw about 5 valet employees screwing off on the curb. I had to yell, \""Excuse me, you guys valet right?\"" They rolled their eyes and began to argue amongst each other. When they finally settled their dispute of who was going to do their actual job, a young kid approached our vehicle. He took our keys and gave me a ticket. But then he asked a nearby female employee for some help and she quickly replied, \""You're going to have to ask someone else. I'm busy.\"" She wouldn't help a fellow employee out and was a total jerk about it. The look of embarrassment on the valet kid's face was heart breaking. Talk about a crew that hated their job and was equally as unprofessional. \n\nIt carried over with the front desk personnel as well. We approached the front desk where there was a line of approximately 8 persons. There were 2 clerks working the front desk but when I approached the open clerk, she said she was not helping patrons at that time. So I went back in line were there were now approximately 10 persons waiting. It should be noted that when I came back down to the lobby about an hour later for a drink at the bar, the line was approximately 25 persons long. \n\nAs I waited in line, my wife took a walk down to the concierge to arrange a taxi. When she asked to have a taxi called in an hour's time, the concierge didn't even look up at her. She pointed towards the front of the hotel with her left hand and said, \""There will be taxis out there all night.\"" Given that my wife is a hotel manager in Los Angeles, she was appalled. At least provide eye contact if you're going to be rude! \n\nWe got to our room and saw that they presented a very nice room. We thought, \""What a shame. This is a beautiful hotel. Too bad the service is so terrible.\"" \n\nGetting ready for the wedding, we both took showers. Everything was going smooth until I reached for the towel. Let me make this clear . . . .  I would not wash my CAR with their towels. The towels at this hotel were extremely thin and stiff. Not only were we shocked that such a nice hotel would present this filth, but it ruined any momentum the hotel was building. \nDue to the fact I was ready long before my wife, I headed downstairs to the bar for a glass of wine. The bartender was very friendly but I must admit, his appearance looked as if he just rolled out of bed. His attire was sloppy and wrinkled, his hair was a mess, and he was at least 2 days unshaven. \n\nIt was almost as if the hotel staff was rebelling against the management. There was no class in this place. \n\nThe only positive experience I had at this hotel came when I needed my wedding band retrieved from my car. I asked one of the valet employees to retrieve it for me out of my vehicle and he did so rapidly. \n\nI will not be returning to this hotel. There are some things that can be overlooked but a common denominator of poor service is not one of them."
0,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.\n\nAside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!\n\nWe had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.\n\nWe started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWe ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).\n\nDaniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be \""more than a pile of onions,\"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.\n\nSo much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...\n\nThis time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that \""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell.\"" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!\n\nAnd the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.\n\nSad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
1,we went for brunch w/friends a couple of sundays ago i had the tasso ham benidict w/a small ramican of sausage gravey on the side (usually over the top) it was fabu the service is always great and lunches/dinners also great good beers on tap and good cocktails
1,"Love this place! I don't go often enough because I never pass it. It's close to my neighborhood but I rarely drive in that\ndirection.\n\nNonetheless, I'm a big fan! Prices are amazing compared to the quality for \""fast food.\"" They prepare the food to order.\n\nTheir tender and delicious teriyaki chicken and their garlic shrimp are must-haves for my fam! The BBQ ribs are a hit for the kids too.\n\nFriendly service. Happy place. Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Try it."
1,"The energetic, off-the-wall, and endlessly entertaining environment at Marquee Dayclub may have just been the most fun I've ever had between the hours of 11 AM - 5 PM: \n\nMy girlfriend and I had Double Date wristbands for Kaskade's Summer Lovin' series - meaning that we had access to both the Dayclub and the Nightclub within the span of the same day. We really just can't get enough of Kaskade. \n\nThe first of the two shows took place at Marquee Dayclub, where we had no problems at all as far as finding the correct line to check-in and claim our wristbands at. The girl who put our wristbands on even went so far as to cheerfully make sure that they weren't too tight on us - a gesture of kindness that I don't witness too often in the clubbing scene.\n\nI've learned some handy tips for those not familiar with Marquee Dayclub: \n\n- I'd advise getting to Marquee Dayclub early - that's your best bet for getting a pool towel to use. That towel, in turn, will allow you to stake your claim somewhere near the pool area (assuming you don't have a chair/cabana on deck, of course). We had little trouble getting a great spot near the main Dayclub pool, being that we arrived at around 12:30 PM or so. This being said, we may have arrived at this day party a bit too early - Kaskade didnt come on until almost three-and-a-half hours after we arrived (although Amtrac had the party rocking all day long!).\n\n- Free water is provided for on both sides of the bar towards the back of the venue, behind the DJ decks. It's got hints of cucumber and is consistently nice and chilled (and never empty), so you've simply got no excuse for paying for bottles of Voss water other than for the sake of looking bougey. \n\n- There are blackjack tables at the ready, all prepped to take advantage of drunken passerby. My advice - don't be that guy. I didn't see a single soul walk away from that table with any look on his face (only the fellas bought the bait) other than that of complete and utter defeat. \n\nOne rather sketchy transaction took place after the lady and I bought a Daiquiri from the bar stationed at the back of the Dayclub. My girlfriend paid with a $100 bill, and it was a good thing I went through the trouble of counting our change back - our bartender shorted us on change by twenty bucks! You would think that it's a common practice for someone working in food/beverage service to count cash back for a customer (especially with larger denominations), but this server made no effort at all to do so. Of course, after her mistake was identified, our bikini-clad bartender was happy to correct things (\""Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie!\""), but I was still suspicious. Frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised if she would've contested this claim, had we not caught it right then and there. \n\nOn the flip side of things, the overall vibe of Marquee Dayclub is laidback, sexy, and irresistibly fun. For me, dayclubbing doesn't exude as much of a pretentious sort of vibe as nightclubbing does, and this was certainly echoed at Marquee. From the group of Asian girls proudly parading around with a massive Kaskade cutout head (which they were repeatedly lending out to other groups of attendees for photo ops!), to the group of gay guys that couldn't stop complimenting my girlfriend and I on how great we looked with one another, the place was filled with folks who just wanted to have fun and take in the experience of a complete departure from the real world. \n\nCoolest of all were the lucky partiers who had booked VIP cabanas that day; in addition to spraying the crowd with bottle upon bottle of Cliquot (we're talking like a college tuition's worth in champagne here, folks), the dayclubbers in one premium cabana kept providing my girl and I with free Heinekens - all in all, I must have anywhere from $30-40 thanks to their generosity! I felt like I was on the set of an episode of \""Entourage,\"" or something to that effect. Needless to say, the crowd at Marquee Dayclub made the \""Summer Lovin'\"" feeling seem all the more real for us. \n\nSpeaking of, Kaskade himself delivered a set that was perfectly geared for a hot Las Vegas day. While it wasn't as diverse as his Marquee Nightclub set later that night (review coming soon!), I nonetheless enjoyed his mix of melodic build-ups and electro house breakdowns. Per usual, everyone's favorite funky Mormon DJ exceeded expectations. \n\nNeedless to say, Marquee Dayclub was a bit of a departure of the norm for me. The Dayclub bug has bitten me, and I'm downright addicted.  \n\n(After a quick power nap, and with hangovers still in tow, my girlfriend and I made our way to Marquee Nightclub later that evening...but it looks like I'll just have to fill you all in on that next time!)"
1,"Get beyond the occasional pretentious d-bags and you will see one of the more beautiful resorts in the valley. Tucked on the north side of Camelback Mtn (or hill, in my eyes) the Sanctuary has one of the more beautiful views in all of PHX. The spa has a clean contemporary feel and is a great way to set the tone for your visit here. Head out to the infinity pool which has amazing views of Camelback and the Phoenix Hills. I haven't eaten at Elements (Chef MacMillan), but I have heard nothing but rave reviews for the food and obviously views. Now, the Jade Bar, this is one of my fav watering holes when I have out of towners in. Perfect way to show your guests all of what PHX has to offer, beautiful scenic views and endless flowing cocktails! The prices seem reasonable for a high end resort and if you can serve my Moscow Mule in a copper mug I will pay a little extra. If you visiting Phoenix, take a little time out and make your way to the Sanctuary, just make sure you bring your camera!"
1,Hands down best Pho in town. Also try the beef salad and tom yum soup. I have yet to try the sandwiches and rice dishes. Definitely coming back to support the business. I found my new spot!
1,"This is my go to spot for car washes. Once upon a time I used to hand wash my car all the time. I don't have time for that anymore. I also don't have a bunch of cash sitting around to pamper my car with fancy car washes. \n\nI've heard from plenty of car wash owners and friends that the brushes at the cheap automated car washes such as these are not too good for the finish and paint of your car. So as awesome as these reviews are, if you have a newer car  or your Honda rice rocket is your pride and joy, pay the extra money. For everyone else, like me, this place is the best. \n\nMy car is always looking fly and my friends always compliment how the inside is so clean. This location will always have a special place in my heart since it was the first time I even ever did an automated car wash, I'm like a little kid looking around and watching everything."
0,"Very bad all the way around. First and only time I will ever go. A bunch of younger people that have no concept of customer service. After ordering our food from a snooty girl, we sat and waited for our food for 25 minutes. While waiting, the employee in the back cooking and the girl preparing the take out and eat in orders were cussing and angry at each other. I heard 4 f bombs and a few b words. Horrible atmosphere. Btw the food was mediocre at best. The food was very greasy and tasteless. Do not recommend going unless your a teenager. Very disappointed."
1,"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!"
1,"This is my families favorite fast food Mexican place! I pick it up about once every 2 weeks. Drive thru is very quick. Family owned. I love the bean & cheese burritos. My husband loves the carne asada burritos & shredded beef tacos.  The cheese crisp is yummy, huge but good for a child for 2 meals. \nFor the price/speed/convenience you can't beat it!"
0,"I'd go to fox only because they were pretty dirt cheap. $25/day for our one day rental during spring break. A taxi would cost upwards of $50 so I can't complain too much. The cars, however, were disgusting. I had an experience with fox in LA. all they had were shitty PT cruisers.. so my expectations for the LV airport weren't too high. THe first day, we got a chevy economy car that was actually decent. On out last day, we had several cars to chose from. The first one my husband jumped in didn't start. He jumped in a couple others.. they were all disgustingly dirty. He settled on a kia. It had stains on the passenger seat and back seat. The odor of coffee was stroooong... It could've been worse, I guess. So although I can't rave about this place, I'd use them again since we only needed the car for a couple of hrs to get to my parent's house/car. If we were going to be using the car for a few days, that'd be a different story. Oh, you know that free shuttle that takes you from the Mccarren airport to the car rental center? You need to wait for another shuttle to take you to fox since fox isn't in the car rental center with budget/enterprise/etc."
1,"What a fun adventure ! Today we went out the gorgeous Cave Creek recreation area  and rode horses with the Cowboys..This has to be one of the best experiences of horseback riding I have had. The horses were healthy and energetic, the trails was breathtaking, the crew very helpful. \nThe horse back operation is ran for the \""winter \"" season by Jeff and Debbie who have this down to a science.

1,"We ate here May 4, 2011 for my daughter's birthday. Before you even go up the elevator, a word of warning. There is a metal detector and weapons are prohibited, so if you have a concealed carry permit and you carry in Vegas (you should), you have to leave it in your car as they have no storage lockers available. Luckily the valet hadn't moved my car yet, so I was able to leave my Glock hidden in there. Not the most satisfactory solution, but there were no problems. \nFood was excellent, service was great, prices were expensive. I would certainly return for one of those \""special occasion\"" dinners."
1,"The employees and owner here are very skilled at what they do. Santiago is the best man to do tint, and the sales reps will do anything that can to help you with you custom auto needs. I do recommend!"
1,"AWESOME!!\n\nWe were looking for a late night dinner and luckily, this place was right across the street from our hotel. We walked by and peeked inside. Everyone was dressed nice. We decided to go in anyway and see if I could get some food to go. A manager spotted us and said hi. I thought he was going to kick us out for looking like scrubs, but instead he escorted us to some tables. He seated us at a table with a little \""occupied\"" sign and took the sign away. Sweet concept. I felt like a VIP even though I was in sweats at a posh lounge. It was as if, the lounge was whispering to me \""we were expecting you, Mr. Elite Yelper\"". \n\nWe ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich and a prosciutto/apple pizza. Both entrees were freakin' awesome. The sandwich had tender slices of roast beef, thick slices of smoked bacon, and a fried egg, blanketed in a soft ciabatta roll. It had a side of onion strings and some sort of phenomenal slaw. The pizza was fantastic as well. It was a white pizza, with Fontina cheese, thin slices of prosciutto, and apples. Odd combination, but it worked really well together. \n\nThe thing I like about this place is the character. The building use to be an old department store, but they managed to convert it to a lounge. The crowd here is very trendy/hipster. They had a DJ spinning some techno/hip-hop and some really trippy (but classy) d\u00e9cor. I like the gutted elevator shaft and the high ceilings. What kind of grossed me out is the fitting room, converted bathrooms. They're uni-sexed, but pretty disgusting. Just think about what it's like to take a dump in a fitting room with no ventilation. Yup, it's exactly what you are probably imagining. \n\nOverall, I really liked this place. The kitchen is open pretty late, the food is excellent, there's no cover, and the food/drink prices are reasonable. The wife and I dropped about 50 bucks post tip/tax on roast beef sandwich, pizza, and two cocktails. This a great place to to start your night, but I would recommend using the restrooms at your next stop. I would definitely come back again. \n\nA little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food."
1,"I was out in Phoenix for a conference and came here for a happy hour. It's a cute little restaurant with great outdoor seating around a firepit with plenty of heaters around. They even had old episodes of Gilligan's Island playing at the bar. \n\nThe drinks are good, and the appetizers are fantastic. I'd recommend the ceviche, the sweet potato fries, and the crab cakes. The waitress was very friendly and felt comfortable joking around with us. \n\nGreat location too, it's just right off of the Light Rail, so if you're staying at a hotel by the airport like I was it's very easy to get back from."
1,"I've been to 5Church both as a bar and for dinner. It is a really fun addition to uptown. Very cool decor and atmosphere. When I went as a bar the first time this summer, it was the weekend and pretty crowded. When I went more recently, it was a Thursday night and not very crowded. Some of the bar managers were sitting at the bar and treated me and my girlfriends to our first round of beers. It was a pretty fun time. I decided to go there for my birthday dinner with my parents and sister, and it definitely didn't feel like the appropriate place to dine with my parents. It was pretty loud in there and just a bit too trendy for a family dinner. However, the food was really good. My sister ordered the lamb burger and said it was delicious. My dad and I both ordered the chicken with sweet potato mash, and it was delicious. My parents both ordered the bibb lettuce salad to start. I tried some and must say it was really good but doused in dressing. I couldn't eat part of it. Overall, would definitely recommend for a weekend night out or dinner with friends or a date."
0,"I hate to give any business a one star rating, particularly if the staff has been friendly,  but the quality of the food here is pretty bad.\n\nMe and my partner went for dinner the week before Christmas.\n\nWe were in town for a week.  This was the worst meal we had.\n\nWaiter was very enthusiastic.  There were no service problems.  The hostess out front was charming.\n\nPartner had the oysters.   He's quite the oyster eater, almost always ordering them in any seafood place.  He says they were among the worst he's had.  By and large for him it was a temperature thing.  Oysters are far better if they are really cold.  Some of his were pretty much room temperature.\n\nI had the calamari appetizer. It was piping hot, if somewhat bland.  Large chunks of calamari, in a very light and tasteless batter.\n\nHe had the fish and chips entree.  I had the bacon-wrapped scallops.\n\nHis was, as he put it, frozen Mrs. Pauls fish stick quality.  Bland.  Unfresh (if that's a word).  \n\nMy scallops were possibly the saltiest things I've ever put in my mouth.   And they had a slightly funky 'maybe they sat out all day' sortof taste.   The side vegetables were overcooked and bland.\n\nThe bathroom is pretty dirty.  A dirty bathroom in a seafood restaurant doesn't instill much confidence.\n\nI honestly wouldn't have been surprised to wake up the next day with food poisoning.\n\nDinner for two (no drinks) was around $70.  FAR too much for substandard seafood. \n\nIn a normal mall in a normal city maybe you'd just say 'eh' and consider it a lesson learned.\n\nBut this is Vegas, with literally unlimited dining choices.\n\nYou can do far, far better.  \n\nThe funny thing is, when we sat down we had an uneasy feeling about the place, so we checked the Yelp reviews.  But we didn't heed them.  Our mistake.\n\nRight down the corridor is Pampass, the Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse.  I didn't get a chance to try it, as I opted for Oyster Bay instead.  I regret that choice.  If you are reading this review outside Oyster Bay, check out Pampass instead."
0,"I've never posted a review but this place really left me with the urge to do so.\n\nTotally incompetent staff, everyone seemed to have a different idea of what the happy hour was, service was well below average, although the prices are ridiculously cheap. But I am not sure if this winds up being a good thing. It seems to reflect upon the quality of people and we are suppose to be in town square! My food took way too long to come out, and somehow it arrived warm at best. The food runner appeared to be overwhelmed. The bartender told me they were out of one of the beers I asked for but later in the night I saw another bartender serve one. Seemed very unorganized and lack of communication between bar staff.\n\nDrunk bartenders and servers, with no sense of urgency to serve customers especially once the DJ starts going and it starts getting messy. This bar really brings the classy out, ( sarcasm ) come see for\nyourself and you'll be in for quite a scene.\n\nMy bartender had to get a manager to take care of something on my check and this became a task. Two different bartenders had served me and I got charged two totally different prices even though happy hour was suppose to be all night. \n\nApparently having a responsible manager readily available is not something this place values. The bartender seemed lost in his attempts to find a manager like he didn't even know where to look. Finally a small girl appeared in plain clothes and a less then professional demeanor to take care of it. \n\nLooks like this place is well on it's way to another failed attempt at making this cursed location a profitable good bar."
1,"Next to the Esso station, atop a little Montreal-staircase, the \""herbs' ankle boot\"" as it is called, is a little wonderland of leaves, teas, tinctures, home-made soaps and the like.\nIt IS really little, teeny-tiny little. You have to zigzag carefully between the pots, and jars to find what you want but chances are their friendly staff has already offered their help by now. Their selection is huge, and they usually recommend stuff I've never even heard of, but always on point. For your DIY needs, they have recipients and jars specially designed if you want to go all-natural and make your own medicine or beauty products.\n\nIf making your own tea for whatever ailment you may have doesn't tickle your fancy, you might dig their courses: they have anything from recognizing the herbs around you, to curing your pets using plants, I recently I noticed they offered \""how to make your own lipbalm\""! \n\nYou don't need to be sick to appreciate all the goodness they have there: they have a lovely selection of organic beauty products from Quebec including shampoo, moisturizer, scrubs, bath salts etc..  That or a simple freshly-made chai tea brew wins me over every time..."
1,24/7 weekdays & long hours on the weekend. Plus if your with a Black Card member it's free. This place leaves little margin for excuses not to get/keep healthy. It's a full blown no brainer & if your not getting busy live'in ... your getting busy die'in
0,"Just a little disappointed with this restaurant... The last time we came here was about 2 yrs ago, we ordered take out and the server decided to add a tip on our bill without our knowledge then we caught it later.  So we eventually received a gift card and we didn't use it until tonight.  We must have had the slowest waiter who made us wait super long for our bill and then gave us big bills for change.  So sneaky, then I had to wait up front to try and get change then low and behold it was the same darn waiter up front who ended up giving me the change.  So disappointed because we tried to give them another chance with no prevail!!!"
0,"We were in South Pointe a little bit ago and when we walked in we immediately felt a weird vibe. Instant paranoia and had a \""look over your shoulder\"" type feeling. We went there for a little gambling and a dinner special they were having and due to their limited availability we did not get the special. We decided to just gamble a bit. After finally looking for someone we ordered a coffee at the bar.  It was 11pm at night and we were told the kitchen was closed. They actually told us its too late for coffee. We gambled a little more and this place just gave us the creeps. Here is the thing... We came up with friends recently (a few weeks after our  original encounter). We never said anything about our experience and our friends asked if we could go to another casino because they didn't like the \""feel\"" of the casino. It was then we told our story and took off."
0,"The waitress was great, the food was ok, and the hostess was terrible!  The manager and hostess sat 2 groups ahead of us that came in after us!  The manager gave an excuse that she can't sit too many people at once in one section.  There were only 2 in our party!  No true apology nor did they offer to make up the inconvenience.  I would never go back!!"
1,I am a very picky restaurant patron and this place won me over! It's a total hole in the wall where the chef is right in front of you preparing really amazing meals. The wine suggestion for me was spot on and the chef made some changes to help with foods I could eat. Don't expect a overly decorated Scottsdale like place. It's very much self put together. But the food is to die for!
0,"Terrible food! Terrible!!! Over priced diner food. Dry, chewy, garbage. Super suburban restaurant that tries to be silly and fun but it's just generic and terrible. If I had 20 thumbs they'd all be down."
0,"WORST PEDICURE EVER. I was just there this morning for a full set and a pedi. The man that did my full set was patient... he had to pry off an old set as I wanted a new fresh one... and I had just gotten a fill so it took a little bit of work. My only complaint with him is that he cut me pretty good with the drill and if it hurts this much now, boy is it gonna smart tomorrow. But I do love how my nails look. Thin and shaped perfectly. The pedi however is where things really head south. She did an ok job on the scrubbing, cutting and filing but that's where it ends. When it came time for the best part, the massage, it's like she was a zombie. She barely rubbed my feet, she rubbed my shins a little bit and my knees (???) but would NOT rub my feet. Thats the part that hurts after being on them all day!!  She squeezed them, pinched my toes, slapped the bottoms of my feet but still no massage. It was like she had no clue what she was doing. Definitely the strangest experience at a salon ever. The polish job was sloppy, polish on my cuticles that she didn't clean up. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  Won't be going back."
0,"My wife and I usually go out of town to see cultural events.  Over the last few years we have attended performances of the San Francisco Ballet,  Los Angeles Philharmonic and Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  We have been to the Disney Center,  the Hollywood Bowl, Ravinia, Chicago Orchestra Hall and the War Memorial Opera House. Now we wanted to see if we had been giving short shrift to the town we live in. Attending a Joshua Bell performance at a brand new venue, what could go wrong?  The answer is a lot.  Granted, this was one performance and I was sitting in the balcony. That caveat said, the Smith Center has problems in three areas: audience behavior, acoustics and staffing.\n\nI have been in better behaved audiences at death metal concerts.  The woman behind me kept tapping her toes, crossing and uncrossing her legs and occasionally kicking the back of my chair.  This was a problem because of the steepness of the seats in the balcony, all the noise and kicking was right by my ears.  The patron next to my wife decided to crack her knuckles and joints during the third selection.  Another patron was rustling her program so loudly (even though she could not possibly have read it in the dark) that I could hear it twenty seats over. But most of all was the incessant coughing, throat clearing and crinkling of plastic water bottles. There is less background noise when a train goes by Ravinia than in this concert hall.   I am always glad to see children exposed to good music and attending a concert is a great way for young people to be socialized.  However, parents control your children or remove them from the hall quickly.  Other venues restrict attendance to children over 8 years of age.  The Smith Center should consider such a limit.  To my fellow audience members: you should applaud at the end of each piece, not between movements.  If you do not know when that is, remain quiet so as not to disturb your fellow concertgoers.\n\n Dear Smith Center Management, Please make announcements about remaining quiet and turning off cell phones and pagers at the beginning of each performance.  Your audience does not know any better and it won't learn unless you tell it.  I silenced my phone for this performance but its ring would have gone unnoticed in this circus.\n\n The staff obviously felt the audience was not making enough noise while the music was playing.  While the music was playing, we could hear slamming doors and items being dropped.  The noises seemed to be coming from backstage.  I was wondering what would come next.  Perhaps the beep beep beep of a trash truck backing up or maybe a backdrop falling over on the stage. There was definitely no way to just lose myself in the music and enjoy the performance.\n\n The staff in the front of the house was courteous and excited to be showcasing the new venue.  However, they did nothing (and I expect this is from inexperience and lack of training) to deal with all the audience noise.  A question I have is, why ask people to arrive an hour before (6:30) the performance but not open the express elevator to the balcony until 7?  Furthermore, the doors to the hall were opened later than that. This really is a quibble, but what is blogging for?\n\n I cannot speak to the overall acoustics in Reynolds Hall after hearing one performance in one seat and I am not an acoustical engineer.  My experience does raise questions about the acoustics at the Smith Center.  First of all, there is no carpeting on the floor of the balcony seats.  It seems to me that this would help dampen the noise emanating from the audience.  The fact that I heard noises from backstage points to a design flaw.  You know people have to work during the performance.  You know you do not want that noise heard out front.  Your design must incorporate things to isolate the backstage activity from the front.\n\n Unfortunately there is no way to tell if all the noise was because of the audience or if the volume of the music reaching me was lower than expected.  In other words was I sitting in a dead spot?  I cannot be sure.  Perhaps my criticism is more properly leveled at the balcony seats.  To know for sure, I would need to attend another performance and sit in another location.  But, after this experience, that is not likely to happen for years."
0,"I keep going back to Tammie Coe because I love their food!  From the quick grab and go small sandwiches and sides (that are really inexpensive actually) to a delicious prosciutto and Parmesan baguette - it has ALL been good.  The cupcakes, the muffins, the coffee.  \n\nThe reason I seriously think today was my last time there is because of the staff. I go there on average once a week, but each time the staff has been rude and each time I think 'well, maybe they were having a bad day'. But since it has happened consistently for nearly a year, and numerous other posts mention the same thing, I'm certain its not me or their bad day. It's their very unprofessional attitude.  \n\n8 out of 10 times the male cashier has had a dirty shirt on (that was way too tight and downright gross) and a two times I was there, the staff in the back were cooking without shoes on.  \n\nAs I write this it appears to me how ridiculous it is that I keep going back, but the convenience and the quality of the food is really hard to find so close to my office.  \n\nI hope you all have a better experience. But Tammie Coe - if you are reading this... Fire the dark haired extra moody barista and the incompetent, dirty-shirted young man.  The manager (I'm assuming) is a really nice guy, but I can't understand why he is allowing such a potentially amazing store be handled so poorly.\n\nMy hope is that those people are gone the next time we're there, replaced with helpful, competent people that are welcoming and fun...otherwise I fear Tammie Coe might be another empty downtown storefront."
0,"Takara is one of the worst sushi/sashimi restaurants in town. Not only was the food disappointing, but the ambiance was rather lackluster, with cheesy 80s muzak playing in the background. The biggest annoyance were the prices; without question, you are not paying for the quality of the food, but rather for the high rent the owners are forced to pay at Les Cours Mont Royal.   \n\nI cannot comment on the entire menu, but I can comment on the dishes that my friend and I ordered:\n1. Seaweed salad: rather bland with a thick tasteless \""ginger\"" dressing on the side.\n2. Soup (don't remember the name): the taste  of the buckwheat noodles and a single tempura shrimp in broth was actually not bad, although not worth the price. \n2. Sashimi: too thin and poorly sliced with a few bones here and there. Some of the pieces looked as if they were torn off of the fish -- which goes against traditional the Japanese art of food preparation .\n3. Hand roll: fell apart upon carefully picking it up.\n4. Green tea: tasted like the cast iron pot.\n5. sake: well, can't go wrong here (thank goodness)\n \nIf you want to pay the same high prices, I would suggest  Zenya, located near La Baie -- it's less traditional, but you'll pay the same price for better ambiance and delicious, well prepared Japanese cuisine.  If you\""re not limited to the downtown core, Maiko on Bernard and Mikado on Avenue Laurier are also very tasty."
0,Sadly I have to say not to much of a fan. I always go to the Green Valley Buffet and love it and we wanted to change the scenery so we thought to try them out. We went for breakfast. The staff from the Cashier to the waitress were very rude. The Cashier instead of handing my husband back his debit card and player card she smacked it down on the counter. We never got refills on our drinks and in fact only saw her twice. \nMy blueberry muffin was HARD. I tried the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese. YUK!! Hard as a rock and the cheese did not taste right. No one cared to listen to us regards to it so we left. NEVER to return
1,"Everthing here was delish. The resturant was cool and minimal. It's byob with cool glass bottle sodas. We brought a 6 pack of Stella which paired well with the spicy flavors we enjoyed. We chose a level 2 on the 1-5 chart for everthing, which was still pretty spicy.\nWe started with the belly buns, pig wings and Thai fried chicken. The belly buns were wonderful and flavorful. Soft buns with awesome pork balanced with clean crisp radish. The pork wings were great to spicy sweet tender the are worth going back. The Thai chicken was good but couldn't compete with the more flavorful \ndishes.\n\nWe had the loveboat soup, which was the most spicy dish of the night. The thin spicy broth and thin rice noodles with ample veggies is the type of soup that builds in heat as you eat but is too good to put down.\n\nWe moved on to the street noodle 1, chaing mai curry, and the yee saw. Street noodle 1, with its generous portion of Thai fried chicken was clean and spicy. The chaing mai was my favorite dish of the night. The tender chicken and twisting noodle were lovingly drenched in a warmingly hot, creamy delish yellow curry sauce. The yee saw was very good spicy sweet and I loved the big chewy noodles.\n\nI would say this place with its great atmosphere, great food, and great service is a great date spot. The above meal ran 70.00 but the portions were large and easy to share. As far as beer I would suggest stay away from IPA'S and Stouts. Any clean belgain or American lager, euro pilsner or even a light corona would work well."
0,"Very disappointed at the service provided by the store!!! Even Wal-Mart has better customer service.  You cannot return anything there!!! I have the following when I try to return my Xbox One:\n\n*Gift Receipt\n*Xbox One (unopened)\n*It was purchased on 11/22/13 so it was well with in the return period\n\nI got an Xbox One as a gift but I already have one, so I try to return it at the store (Unopened and with the receipt). They said I have to call to return it because it was purchased on their website. I called their supposed \""store phone number\"" but is a call center in India that handle their store phone call. They cannot transfer you to someone at the store at all!\n\nWhen I told her I want to return my new Xbox One, they told me I have to get the credit card number and email address of the person who give me the gift!!!! I explained that it was a gift but she said she cannot help me without that info. After going back and forth with her for 10 minutes, I ask to speak with a supervisor. She put me on hold for 15 minutes and told me that because I don't have the order information (I guess the receipt and order number isn't good enough) they cannot escalate my call to a supervisor. She pretty much told me she cannot help me. I asked to see if maybe someone can call me or I can email someone she said they don't have that! What? Microsoft does not have a customer service email?\n\nI'll probably going to sell it on craigslist or something and get me a playstation 4. At least if I buy something from the Sony store or Apple store I can return it.\n\nBottom line - if you are going to buy a Microsoft product, buy it from Amazon, BestBuy, Wal-Mart, etc... because at least you can return it!"
0,"I'm used to every chick Fila I go to gladly giving law enforcement, military police, and corrections officers 30-50% discounts. I visit the ones at stapley, university, and ray road weekly due to this, with much appreciation to chick Fila for their support and understanding for those working in this industry. I was shocked to find out that this independently own and operated chick Fila not only refuses to offer this discount but also waters down their beverages more, decreases their weight/portions more and Frys thier chicken more deeply.  I will not be revisiting this chickfila and will gladly share with other law enforcement that unlike other supportive chick Filas through out az, this one stands out in a negative way and does not do justice to other restaurants baring its name."
0,Very unhelpful and rude. I sat down with Francisco Ramirez to go over details of my account. I didn't have a debit card so he asked for two forms of ID. I handed him two STATE issued IDs and he said that would not work (iv never heard of that) it was an Arizona ID and my state drivers license. I has to go to my car and get my business license. After that he was rushed and very short and rude and my problem wasn't resolved. He just told me to call the number on the back of my card for better luck. Never coming back to this branch again.
1,"Happened upon this place while waiting to watch Zumanity @ the NYNY. I was actually pretty surprised by this place. It has a nice atmosphere and really decent prices for an in casino restaurant. The chips and salsa were perfect and the carnitas tacos I had were moist and juicy. Everything served hot and fresh with great ambiance. The beans were pretty tasty, and something most restaurants mess up. If your on this end of the strip its not a bad place to stop before heading to the club."
0,"Slow service, very small pour for overpriced wine.love the rustica pizza. i like to carry out garlic knots and a rustica from their tatum location. for some reason no garlic knots at the location on indian bend."
1,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. \n\nWas well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)\n\nThe menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) \n\nWe started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):\n\n- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.\n\n- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.\n\n- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.\n\nWe were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.\n\nThe chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm\nCame with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. \n\nWould definitely come again\n\nFYI: \nhappy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"
1,"When we moved from CO. we weren't sure if we were going to find a water park for our Dane/Lab mix to enjoy...We were wrong..Just Like Home has a doggy waterpark that she loves, the staff has been great with her showing her all the attention she deserves. We have use both the daycare as well as the boarding. Great pricing..\n We are big fans of JLH and will be coming here for as long as Matilda can keep up.."

1,"I never thought I'd spend more than $10 on a carwash until I stopped at Autobell.  I thought to myself, $25 for a carwash?  Really?  And an automated car wash at that.  I've since changed my tune after having my car washed there many times.  The extra $$ isn't so much about the car wash itself, its the service provided after the car has been washed.  I've never seen a harder working group of people.  Depending on what you get, they will completely towel dry you vehicle, wash the inside of your windows, shine your tires, and wipe down your dashboard with Armor-all.  What I can tell you is this - I've paid $200 to get my car detailed before at Honda.  I've been happier with the $25 car wash at Autobell.  I should have saved myself $175.  That being said, they do have a $4 ride through option that I also used in between the more thorough washes I described.  The $4 ride through is more of what I was initially thinking when I thought the $25 options were over priced.  You don't get any frills.  You sit in your car while it goes through the automated wash cycle - thats it.  No towel dry or any other service.  This is a great option most of the time for me.  Great job Autobell!!!"
0,"I don't understand why everyone is so positive about this buffet. We've eaten at the wicked spoon with the 6 of us today and all of us think that this is one of the worst buffets in Vegas.\nThe quality and choice of dishes does not meet up to the high price of this buffet.\nThe salmon was far from well cooked and had been on the warm plate much to long, so was the shrimp. \nThe carvery was pretty much the same as most low budget buffets and there was no steak or lamb chops or something like that which I think you may expect for the price they charge.\nAlso meat and fish stand right next to eachother which ruins the meat for people who don't like or can't eat seafood. \nI will never visit this buffet again, I'll go to Spice Market at PH or the buffet at MGM instead."
0,"I've shopped at this location several times now and at first I had a great experience and thought the staff was friendly and helpful. I now have mixed feelings about the place. The salespeople are still helpful but apparently not to everyone. My wife, who is not athletic, is mostly ignored by the staff whenever she shops there for gifts. When I went there today to try on shoes I researched online, the guy that helped me barely answered any questions and was so uninterested in the sale he only looked me in the eye once or twice. It's not that he was in a hurry or anything, because the store was barely occupied and I had already waited through their 15 minute queue. I noticed that he was fully engaging with other shoppers on my way out, though. I would like to give them a better rating because they do know their stuff, but in my experience if you don't look like an athlete the level of service you get will be hit or miss. If I shop there again it will be online purchases when they have better deals than Amazon."
0,"I believe that Cream Stereo Lounge claims to have the loudest sound system in the Valley. That might be the only credit I give them because after living outside of this bar for a year, I can attest that their stereo system is loud...and when I say loud, I mean it in a delirious-I-didn't-sleep-night-after-night-because-of-their-sound-system sort of way. But this review will not be solely based on my sleep deprived nights. \n\nI swore I would never enter Cream Stereo Lounge mostly because I knew it wouldn't be my scene and mostly because of my lack of sleep thanks to this Old Town spot. However, after years of avoiding Cream, I've been dragged their now twice and can say that it was everything I expected. \n\nI did the clubs. I can still do the clubs if the night calls for it. However, Cream Stereo Lounge is not quite the club for me. It's tiny, it's loud, it's normally not very crowded and the crowd that frequents this bar isn't for me. The drinks are pricey, the music is mixed and there isn't a ton going on there. They charge a cover which is rarely the case for a bar in Scottsdale and I don't think it would be worth it for a guy or girl to pay a cover to go to this bar."
0,Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8am\nWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone \nVery disappointing
1,Skyler the bartender was outstanding. Should be nominated bartender of the year!!!! Great drinks and service.
1,"Had a great breakfast here today. Their pancakes are wonderful! My daughter loved the Mickey Mouse pancake and ate nearly everything on her plate. My friend had the Eggs Benedict which they said was delicious and I tried the bacon, eggs, hash browns and pancakes all of which were very very tasty. Also the fresh squeezed orange juice is very good. Service is great too."
1,"I was surprised to discover this was the first Mexican restaurant to open in the whole of Scotland. Ever since 1984 they seem to have been refining their speciality frozen margarita as it's a crowd pleaser. The concoction of lime juice, tequila and triple sec seems to be just right, leaving you willing to delve into their Mexican fare.\n\nThe food offerings are decent enough with the nice touch of a real salad instead of the usual carrot shavings and a wilted leaf. \n\nTop stuff!"
0,"We were recommended this hotel by a local.\n\nWalking in, I was delighted. Fun to look around (as we waited an hour to be seated).  While waiting we were approached and asked if we'd like a drink. When we asked what they had, we were told 'there's a long list on the table behind you' - the table with people sitting at it.  FYI - they have a full bar, but nothing on tap.\n\nSo, the food. Great salad and a yummy hot chocolate they call cappuccino.  The garlic bread and wine that also come with the meal were mediocre. The food was...just ok. I guess when I pay $30 for a bowl of spaghetti I am expecting to get wowed!  Not the case here - and the portion is not a family style portion which would have helped explain the cost.\n\nWe were entertained by the accordian player - sweet, little old man who made us smile and enjoyed the overall ambience of the restaurant. Not sure I would return, or even suggest to it a friend though."
0,"The food here is mediocre at best and the wait is horrendous.  The only redeeming perk is that they provide free wine at dinner. Granted, its not great wine, but its palatable and its free. My boyfriend likes to gamble at GVR and usually gets several 2-1 coupons during the month; so we eat here quite often. I know it'll take 45 minutes to an hour to be seated, even if there's less than 30 people in line, so I usually bring a book and read in line while he continues to gamble.  I once asked the cashier why it took so long and she said they didn't have enough servers, so they try to stagger the diners.  The food at Sunset Station is the same and the lines move 10 times faster."
1,it's a pick-up taco stand inside a bar-about 10 person seating-with nice murals & bar decor. kinda of skanky dirty dive\nsuprise! suprise! very spicy & super tender meat almost like pot roast. mex mix(pico) was spicy!! hamburger was like you bbq it yourself-yummy. mushrooms a little overdone & greasy. chimichanga & bean tostadas were delicous!!\nreal good food for a bar. especially if your inebriated!! Did I forget to mentio they deliver 24/7!!!\ni wish they would get rid of the styrofoam container all ready-it just kills food!!
1,Love to watch movies and I love this theatre.  They have tons of options all of the time and really large theatres which makes it nice.  Always clean and lots of variety.
0,"I came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch. The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights, CA or San Gabriel, CA. My friend and I are hardcore dimsum fans, so we have been to this dimsum a few times, until we decided to change to the one across the street called Phoenix Palace Buffet. \n\nFor some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!"
1,"I don't come to Dillard's expecting a Nordstron-like shopping experience. If I need to be pampered, I go to Nordy's. Dillards is where I come when I already know generally what I want, and I know no one is less expensive. IMO, Dillard's strength is their competitive pricing and their unbelievable sales. For years, I assumed this was only temporary, the Arkansas-based retailer will randomly go upscale. They've never done this and as a result, I still love shopping at a Dillard's.\n\nThis isn't to say the service is bad, it's just that store employees do not out-number customers and sometimes this can \""feel\"" like it's the case in a Nordy's---especially in Men's suits."
1,"I finally got to see what all the hype was about. Went there an night about an hour after they set up. They were out of their specials so (kalbi and pulled pork sliders) so I had to make due with their angus burger sliders.\n\nThey were pretty good, similar to what you expect from an angus slider at a place like burger bar at Mandalay bay, but probably a bit cheaper. The main thing is the novelty of the idea of following around their truck and eating on a curb side with your friends.\n\nThe only downsides were they were out of their specials which I wanted to try since while their angus sliders were really good, they're also good everywhere else you go to get a gourmet burger. The other was the really long wait (about 30 min) to get the food which in my opinion is a bit long to be waiting to get food from a truck."
1,Went there 3 times. Takoyaki is highly recommended and there is real octopus in it. The shrimp dumplings are so delicious! I like the black pepper noodle. But make sure you avoid Ten Shindon Rice unless you know what it is. Also the Chinese translation to Ten Shindon Rice is incorrect. The Japanese Udon is insipid. Will try more kinds of ramen in the future. Plus I really like the street shot of Tokyo on the wall.
0,"I get it its a free show . Yes you don't have to pay. But just because its free doesn't mean we have to watch this GARBAGE! I watched it last night and  boy I am glad I want waiting like the rest of the people there. I just so happen to be walking by. The show IT IS NOT FOR KIDS! It is full of sexual innuendos just gross stuff. The sirens aren't sirens they are just girls wearing close to nothing outfits rubbing they breast against ropes and just ZERO talent. The impression I got was that the casino HAD a good pirate theme production but had to turn this into a grouchy show to attract men to come inside to see all this girls. The show was so bad I walked away and  many people walked away too. Many people felt offended and just walked away very disappointed . DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. If you do decide to go the only exciting thing is the few fire flames from the \""explosion \"" and maybe the pirate ship. PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS ."
1,"I really dig the rhythm room! I went to a concert here on Monday night. \n\nit was cute.\nit was quaint.\nit was CLEAN.\ngreat bartenders, love the option to sit or to stand. \n\nthe sound guy was a bit off and im pretty sure my ear is still ringing from the high pitched squeel when the microphones got too close to the speaker or something. but hey, it happens i guess. \n\ni had a blast at this sweet little spot."
0,"Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here!  The food at this place is absolutely disgusting!  The soup was so salty and tasted like muddy water.  The rib appetizer wasn't even edible!  It was like it had been made a week earlier.  The foil wrap chicken app was some mysterious pieces of chicken stuffed in foil with salt!  Disgusting!  The sweet & sour pork was seriously like chewing on shoe leather! It had no flavor whatsoever....like it had been boiled to death.  The lo-mein wasn't any better.  It was so salty that you couldn't even eat it!  I hadn't been to this place for about 10 years, due to the last experience I had here.  Made a huge mistake thinking it got better after 10 years.  Not even a little bit better!  Save your money!  Panda Express blows this place away!  And I'm not a big fan of that place either....but at least the food is fresh!  I don't know how China Inn even keeps it's doors open!  Very strange cause there is rarely cars there...hmmm."
1,"I felt like I was whisked away to San Francisco or San Diego when I stepped foot in here. The line was nearly out the door for lunch but it moved quickly. I took my order to go afraid I wouldn't find an open spot, but tables did turn over quickly too. I love the concept happy and healthy, it ought to please everyone. I opted to stay on the healthy side TBLT with sweet potato fries. The sandwich packed a lot of flavor and it was quite good. I'd definitely get it again. They also make a tasty sweet potato fry. The were a bit limp by the time I got them back to the office so next time I'd like to try them fresh. I'll take my chances and dine in."
0,"Generally speaking, I am a big fan of the burger.  I'm also a big believer in (and a fan of) good service.  To that end, Dotty's both delivers and disappoints.\n\nThe burgers are great.  A small group of us wandered to Dotty's over the weekend; I had been there many times before, while the rest of the group had never been to Dotty's before.  We were promptly seated in a large booth - Dotty has some great booths... not gonna' lie.\n\nAnd then we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  Eventually a server came by and said he'd be \""right back to take our drink orders.\""  We waited some more.  \n\nIt wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't been visiting at 2:30pm on a Saturday, and the place was virtually empty... but we waited a good 15-20 minutes to place our drink order.  Then we waited another 10 or so to get our drinks.  Then we ordered the food, which took a long time to come out as well.  \n\nAfter receiving our food, we never saw the server except for when he dropped off the bill.  No follow-up, no \""how are things,\"" nothing like that... just crappy service.  He never noticed that our drinks were empty; he didn't offer to bring us another round - we had to find him and ask for another round.  And it took a long time to get those drinks...  If the service would've been even the slightest bit decent, we would've sat at Dotty's, drinking and eating all afternoon.  But thanks to the horrible service, we paid and left far earlier than we would've liked to have.\n\nHorrific service aside, the burgers were excellent - we had an Ostrich burger (with muenster, grilled onion, lettuce and tomato), a Heart Throb (not really \""hot\"" but it had a good balance of flavor/heat), a Melting Pot (if you like cheese, look no further), and a Honey Dijon (tasty).  The burgers were perfectly cooked, perfectly sized, and simply delicious.\n\nWe also ordered a sampler basket, which included onion rings, deep fried mushrooms, fried mac-n-cheese, cheese curds, and fries.  All were solid.  A tad greasy, but solid.\n\nIf the service didn't suck so bad, I'd give this place 4.5 - 5.0 stars.  The dude who waited on us should consider a new line of work... that's how bad it was."
1,"The wait staff was nice, and the guy who works up front (owner?) looks like Seal's little brother.  The \""Kiss by a Rose\"" guy - used to be married to Heidi Klum.  I think my favorite dinner dish is the Grilled Lamb Chops but if you go for lunch, get the curry!  I might actually cheat on my girlfriend for a bowl of the curry.  I'm not sure if that's an indicator of my character, or an indicator of how good the curry is.  But I digress...  If you like bad food, don't go here, you won't find it. See what I did there ;)"
1,In a pinch you can always count on Ace Hardware!\n\nI needed some stake tape for my tomato plants and it was a tomato emergency so off to Ace I went.. being that its my local neighborhood store you'd think I would have been in here before. The Mr LOVES this place and is constantly making up reasons to go here.. I think he just likes the Ace points for discounts on future purchases.. anyhoo.. they had the tape and my tomato plants were saved from ruin! \n\nThank you Ace!! You're my neighborhood hero!
0,"We were looking forward to a yummy lunch, and we were more than disappointed. The food was nearly inedible and the waiter never inquired as to our satisfaction. The sandwich was ten dollars and there was almost no lamb to be found in the wrap. When the bill came, there was an extra charge for the fries that the waiter told us came with it!  The owner came over and kept telling us that the menu showed the side was not included. After he said he would take off the extra charge, i told him that the food was not good, his tone became menacing. Then he put the charge back on the bill. We didn't argue further because we felt threatened. DON't go here. This was about the worst dining experience we have ever had!"
0,Sat at a mostly empty bar took the bartender Nikole about 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge me and had a rude attitude and large use of continuous profanity. \n\nFood was good I ordered from the restaurant with decent prices but ate my food and went elsewhere due to that bartender
0,"Don't go here!\n\nMy wife and I bought gift certificates for our mothers to go here as a thank you gift for setting up our wedding shower. Unfortunately they were very busy after the wedding working to pay for everything so they couldn't make it to the spa before the gift certificates expired after six months. I realize this is a long time, but the spa still accepted our money, so they should return a service. \n\nThe moms finally tried to set up an appointment and called to see if they would still honor the gift certificates even though they had expired, knowing they would probably be spending additional money on things beyond what was covered by the $15.\n\nApparently the spa decided they were going to keep our money and not return a service and just said \""sorry, those are expired\"". \n\nSo, I can't even review their services because they chose the path of greed over friendly service."
0,The worst customer experience we have ever received! My family and I were going to purchase some new books like we have done many times before but the way we were treated by a B&N employee (older women wearing glasses) was anything but family friendly! If you're a miserable person please refrain from dealing with the public. Looks like Amazon will have to be my new book source.
1,"This is an inviting and interesting antique shop in Newington which offers high quality furniture, ornamnets and rugs at reasonable prices.  Although the owner doesn't stock the highest quality stuff and most of it is second or third hand, it's all in relatively good condition and priced accordingly.  The shop has a cool ambiance and feels like it's in its own little world.  I didn't buy anything but after a look around you feel inspired to surround yourself with old stuff.  \nThe owner told says that he get's new stock in frequently and he can reserve certain items for interested customers.  Allan K L Jackson is definitely a place to visit either for furnishing things or just a look round."
0,If there were an option for 0 stars that's what I'd choose. This place should be shut down. Years ago I made the mistake of taking my puppy Lucy to get spayed here and from the get go the staff was very rude and acted as if they were put out answering any questions I had at all. Later that day I picked Lucy up and her incision looked like a giant sloppy wound you would see in a horror movie. When I asked about it they assured me it was fine and would not send home any pain meds for her. The next few days Lucy was in extreme pain wailing and crying all night which shouldn't be the case. I thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother's. Just yesterday my brother took his puppy Leo here to get neutered when they picked Leo up he was bleeding everywhere. When they brought it to the vets attention they assured them that it's normal to stop worrying. So they took him home. Well the bleeding wasn't normal he kept bleeding profusely to the point that his scrotum was completly filled up with blood and swollen up huge. This is the point they took him to the emeegency pet clinic where they gasped and said it is definatly not normal. They kept Leo overnight and good thing. They said if he wasn't brought in there was a good chance he would have bled out overnight. They also informed him that they get quite a few emergencies that come in after going to this hack shop North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic. So take it from me if you can avoid this place at all cost if your pet means anything to you. I will never step foot in this place again.
0,"After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate, here it goes. \n\nWe approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair. When she jokingly said \""no\"" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied \""no\""! I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.\n\nSo, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. \n\nOh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled. \n\nWhile I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here. \n\nThey'll be hearing from me soon."
0,I did not like the food. I see a lot of oil in curries. I don't recommend this to anyone.
1,"Our waitress was a complete doll. Very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I gave 4 stars due to two things. First, although my calamari appetizer was delicious and my gyro pita the same, I don't like finding broken toothpicks in with the cucumber (yes, I had already pulled the other ones out completely). Second, my father's blackened salmon was waaay overcooked. I understand one usually doesn't go to a Greek restaurant to order blackened salmon, but cooking fish is pretty basic. In the restaurant's defense the waitress was extremely apologetic and offered to bring him a new plate, but he declined. I didn't mention my toothpick to her, since otherwise the food was delish.\n\nStill the best Greek food I've had in a long time and I will definitely go back."
1,Amazing food! Some of the best curry we have had! So craveable & authentic !!
1,"Went to the Gyro House for lunch today.  My sister has been telling me about this place for awhile.  I wasn't disappointed.  Family run business.  Marlene (I hope I got your name right?) was awesome!  The beef gyro was excellent.  The pita bread warm and so fresh it must've been made this morning.  I used to by Pita Bread back in Oxnard from a greek bakery so I know good pita bread!  Anyway, the gyro had just the right amount of meat with a great sauce, lettuce, tomatoes etc. It came with big fat fries cooked to perfection.   Ordered the baklava to go and it was delicious!  My only regret is this place isn't closer!"
0,"My family went to this Outback for Sunday lunch.  We usually go to the Sahara location but they do not open until 3pm.  Anyway, when we were seated we were not given a kid's menu.  No big deal by itself but then:\n\n1) 10 minutes before being greeted by \""I will be right back\"" by the server\n\n2) Server told us kids cannot order steaks any way but well done.  We told her that could not be true, we order the same thing for the kids every time, so she accepted our order for a medium steak for our daughter.\n  \n3) 5-10 minutes later, and we still do not have our drinks, we are told by a different person that children absolutely must have steaks cooked only well done.  We are offered no explanation.  We finally just left and went somewhere else.\n\nWell done meat has more dangers than eating meat rare in the longterm.  There is no real explanation for this if the kitchen is using proper sanitary practice so either they are admitting they are not or the Outback employees are just so lazy they wanted us to leave so they would not have to work as hard."
1,"I like this place a lot! It's really close to my house and they are open late. The atmosphere is nice, music good and staff are friendly. The drinks are a little pricey but I think it's worth it. As I am writing this review, I have only been here twice. I got the Pistachio Latte both times because it's amazing! Not overly sweet which is a huge plus. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the last time I was there, I was sweating heaps because their heater was on really high. It didn't help that I had a hot drink to make it worse. I was dying to get out of there asap but pushed through, although, complaining about it the whole time.  I am hoping it isn't always like this. I like being warm but not to the point that I can't wait to get out of the place!\n\nI'll be back again. I really wanna try their dessert. I've seen pictures of their waffles and toast and it looks delicious!"
0,"My friends and I always meet up here when I am visiting from out of town. The service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible. One of my friends got there first and a soon a he sat down at the table in the bar area he was presented by the blonde female bartender with a $150.00 tab. He politely told the girl this wasn't his tab and she proceeded to literally scream at him and fly off the handle.  Luckily the tab owners had just stepped outside for a moment, but from that moment on we had the most terrible service from her. I ordered a margarita and it was disgusting with nothing but mixer and a few cubes of ice. The guys were ordering beers and they literally had to approach the bartender at the bar for two different rounds of beer because the bartender would not return to service our table like she was servicing the rest of them. We had to ask for menus because we were not offered any and anytime we attempted to speak with or get the bar tender's attention she just glared and smirked and acted like everything was just a big inconvenience to her. She was literally snatching money out of out hands while we were paying. Ridiculous."
0,Busy airport eatery.  Nuff said.
1,"I have been to Rosemary's for Lunch (now only on Fridays) & Dinner multiple times in the last four years.  They always provide great food, service & value.  I like that they provide wine & beer pairings with each course.  Nice bar/lounge area where you can get a \""small plates\"" menu or anything off the regular menu.  I recommend the BBQ shrimp & salmon tartar apps.  They also have great seasonal soups.  For entrees I like the scallops, crispy skin bass & the steaks.  Sunday nights they have half off bottles of wine.  They also have many beer & wine dinners during the year."
1,"The service was spot on.  They have a very small bar section (three seats) but for someone often on the road it was perfect. The alcohol selection is very limited (primarily beer and wine) but they make this up with wonderful food. I tried the mild yellow curry with chicken.  A lot of sauce (it could have used some more potatoes and onions) but a strong flavor. Far from fine dining but a great local, casual dining spot."
0,"No too bad of a place, bit a bit pricy for what you get. Atmosphere is fairly decent, but parking is terrible for that entire plaza. I probably would not go back unless I was meeting friends there that I really wanted to see. Decent selection of craft beers."
0,"Curt and abrupt management.  Turned away on Mothers Day because, in fine print, my gift certificate had expired.  In my mind, along with a good massage should come quality customer service.  Though I had frquented other locations, I will never return and will relate this experience to my friends."
0,"Ugh. Outside of getting our order wrong, their \""extra large\"" pizza was not so extra large. In addition, it was gross. Not nearly enough sauce or cheese, and scant toppings. Wow....super disappointed. The wings were passable, but barely. Also, no carrots or celery. Amateur league, guys. Seriously..."
0,"I have fond memories of the 'wichcraft in Bryant Park from a few years ago.  Maybe it was the sitting-outside-and-actually-being-outside that made the experience so enjoyable... but no, I really think it was the fresh, hot sandwiches that made it such a memorable lunch spot.  It's too bad Vegas has Vegas-ized it into mediocrity.\n\nThe line was to the door at 4pm on a Saturday.  I was surprised, but I guess I shouldn't be - I forgot how time means nothing when you're in a casino.  Considering the sandwiches were pre-made and just needed to be plopped onto the panini-griller, it seemed to take a while - but I wasn't in a hurry, so I can deal.  \n\nI ordered the ham/cheddar/apple on pumpernickel and got it to go.  I was so excited to savor the awesomeness remembered from Bryant Park that I ripped it open in the car to take a few bites.  \n\nOooh, messy!  I don't know what happened - maybe the water content of the apples was too much? - but half of the sandwich was so soggy, it was like it had just been bathed.  The other half was just fine - so strange.  I think cheddar was the wrong cheese choice on their part - it made the whole thing so bland, like it zapped out any flavor the apples and ham had brought to the table.  I hate to say it, but I've had a Subway sandwich or two more exciting than this.  Maybe their other creations are better?"
0,"I really didn't want to write this review since Chica Loca Taco is new. I know how hard it is to succeed in the restaurant business and I think there are very good intentions behind Chica Loca Taco but there could be improvements with the food. I was very excited to learn that this place would be serving Mexican street food so have been eyeing the place throughout the entire time of construction, awaiting for their opening. I haven't tried the gelato but I don't get the connection with the Mexican food. \n\nAnyway great that there are fresh ingredients but the fresca and green salsas needed salt and pepper. Chips were okay. Al pastor and chorizo had some flavor but needed a little more of something - perhaps again salt and pepper or even hot sauce. Chorizo looked kind of like minced dog food...\n\nI left the place with the right amount of full in my belly but not the right type of satiated full. Price is reasonable and the service was incredibly friendly."
0,"It's so unfortunate about how bad this place is, because it's so close to my house. We go in there about once a month hoping it's better and it always disappoints. The food is horrible. I've had 1/2 the items on the menu looking for something good, and there's nothing that brings me back, and what's worse, most of it needs to be avoided. They tout their burgers, and then ask you how you want it cooked, which is really funny since they cook EVERYTHING well done, no matter what you ask for. I don't mind places that cook to one temperature, but don't ask me how I want it cooked if you're not going to cook it that way. Two of the three times I had a burger I was with a friend that got one as well. I order Med-Rare, he gets Med-Well and they both come out the exact same. \n\nThe place used to have the coldest beer in the area, but even that's gone. Went there the other night because I only had 30 minutes to kill and didn't want to drive a little further to my favorite bar. I just wanted to watch the baseball game, but they wanted a cover charge because some UFC fight was on.\n\nThe waitress can be cute, but the service is poor unless you're at the bar. They have one bar tender (not sure his name, has a shaved heard) that has great service, but that's it since Megan is gone. \n\nIt's not bad enough where'd I say avoid because their happy hour prices aren't bad for drinks, but we only go there when there's no time to go anywhere else."
0,This was sad sad place. Even being the weekend the place didn't have many patrons. Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.
1,"Had the most amazing dinner with my wife on her birthday!\nThe sirloin was the best I've ever had, and I recommend the cheesecake for a after dinner desert."
0,"Wow. The receptionist here is RUDE. I am not even visiting the doctor. I'm here with my grandma who is seeing the doctor. They were rude to her on the phone when she called, telling her that she would probably have to wait a very long time because Mondays are horribly busy in a way to make her feel bad. That rubbed me the wrong way. Why not inform her that there might be a wait rather than make her feel bad about it? \n\nOnce we got here, she didn't even have to wait. The only people in the waiting room were waiting for their wives who were seeing the doctor, not actually waiting to SEE the doctor. \nAs I'm sitting here, I heard the receptionist \nmake an outbound call to someone then complain to someone else in the office, threatening about how \""it's okay, they will just be sent to collections\"" as that will be his revenge on the client for whatever reason- all within earshot of other patients. \n\nI hope this doctor is worth the piss poor receptionist sitting behind the desk. \n\nI'm giving 2 stars since I've never seen this Doctor. I'd like to give one just for the guy behind the desk."
1,"My cousin showed me this place a few years ago when I turned 21, and it was a place I would have never taken a second glance at. It's on Grand Ave, a shady area, so during the week you definitely get the odd/scary crowd. Mostly homeless people or day laborers. I avoid the bar during the week, but Friday and Saturday nights are where it's at!! They've been having the same DJ who plays an amazing mix of indie music, electronic, and even oldies that have a beat added to them. On the weekends towards the tail-end of the night this place is always packed! I usually hate bars that are super crowded, but this is one I actually like. It adds to the whole Bikini experience. Usually it's a bunch of young hipsters, drinking, dancing, singing, and not giving a f*** about what anyone thinks. Bikini is awesome because everyone is usually super cool, and the drinks are super cheap! Like $3-$4. The bartenders seem very moody at times, but it's not a huge deal to me. I love the neon pictures and totems, and the streamers hanging from the ceilings are very fun."
1,"I think I've found a new favorite restaurant! The food is very fresh and flavorful, atmosphere is quiet and clean, service is outstanding... the owner is so welcoming that it felt more like I was dining at his home than a restaurant! A1!"
0,"I went here for happy hour at 5:30pm on a Thursday and it wasn't too crowded. We sat outside which was a mistake because it was SO loud with all the bikes across the street. The drinks were just ok, and the brie appetizer was kind of a joke. Only served with 3 small pieces of bread? Most people order appetizers for at least 2. We asked for more and they brought it out free of charge. The service however was great so that kind of made up for the mediocre drinks and appetizer."
1,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a gambler.  I'm not into giant buffets.  I'm not into smoke-filled casinos.  I'm not into Elvis impersonators.  So, the fact that I could have enjoyed my recent stay in Vegas at all is a testament to Aria.  It's one classy, non-Vegas, well-designed, stunning place:  a city of steel and glass.  If you want Vegas cheese, go elsewhere.  If you want a place with a little class and fewer drunks, I would recommend staying at Aria.  \n\nMy suite was a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall glass, apartment-sized pad with everything electrified.  Wake up to your curtains automatically opening throughout the room.  Enjoy your well-equipped bathroom and your Toto Washlet.  Then make your way downstairs to one of their elegant dining spaces.  \n\nI wish I had more time to have shopped at Viceroy.  I managed to be actually inspired by the men's clothing they had.  In 15 minutes I nabbed a pair of John Varvatos pants at 65% off, and got them hemmed for pick up later that night.  Now that's Vegas!\n\nIn addition, the conference facilities were clean, generous, and well-equipped.  Nothing too elaborate, but everything you would want for a large-scale conference or meeting.\n\nMy only complaints, which are small, are:\n\n- The bathroom sink faucets splash back at any water level.  Did no one on the design team actually notice (or get soaked by) this design flaw?  \n- No in-room coffee maker...even in a suite?  Really?!\n- The Aria limo picking me up at the airport was an hour and 15 minutes late.  However, they made up for it with a beautiful cheese and wine service in my room.\n\nIf I find myself going to Vegas again, this will be my stop."
1,"We came back to visit Montreal in large part because the food experience is so high quality. Within this city setting, Cafe Via Dante is a jewel. The generational evolution from corner-coffee/community-center to fine dining is authentic - as is the prosciutto slicer on display. The knowledgeable staff lets fresh and artisinal ingredients speak for themselves. Sure, there are fancier decors and chandeliers to be had elsewhere, but it would be hard to find a more delicious and delightful dinner experience."
0,Overall just not that great.  I got the fajitas and was not impressed.  Service was slow even though they only had about 3 tables to wait on.  I won't be going back - wish there was better Mexican food in Gilbert!
1,"Hubby and I had $100 food credit so we ate here twice.  The portions are huge, the service is good and the menu was quite good. I especially loved the chicken corn chowder (So yummy). I did think some items were missing. I would have loved a tuna sandwich or a quesidilla. The prices are on par with other 24 hour cafes in vegas and the quality was way better than most."
1,This is the best Target in Vegas. I've been to 6 and this store is great. Staff are friendly. Returns are easy. Clearance is regularly cheaper than other area Targets. The only thing missing is a Starbucks. Please please put one in!!!
1,"This is not your typical Catholic Church!\n\nConsider St. Sharbel as an Eastern Catholic Church, where there are still main components as the Roman Catholic Church, the only difference is that the language that is used in some of the responses are in Aramaic (Jesus' language).\n\nMy grandma brought me here, as she has been visiting this church since Easter. She loves the sermons and the fact that this parish uses Aramaic within their masses. The church is nestled within a neighborhood, where there is still development going on. The hall is quite large, while the church is somewhat in transition as it is just a huge bungalow (the parish is raising money to build a nice church). But the decor of the church-bungalow was not your typical Roman Catholic design. The stone work reminded my grandmother of Jerusalem (where she happened to travel back in the day for a pilgrimage), while the use of incense was abundant throughout the mass. Most of the parishioners were Filipino, Italian, Lebanese, Hispanic and Indian. \n\nIt was my first Aramaic-English mass that I've ever attended. I liked how there was a flat screen so you can read-along to what the readings and the responses were. Overall, if I lived in the area, I wouldn't mind attending mass here as it is quite different than your traditional Roman Catholic churches!"
0,"Was at the Excalibur for Memorial day weekend (5 days total). Check in easy enough, however we were told we were getting a free upgrade! Lol carpet stained, smelled bad, beds were hard as rocks! Could have sworn it was a box spring. Sheets and pillows were filthy stained as well as the towels.  View was of the roof. Staff still enters room with privacy tag up to change linens with more stained linens. And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.\n\n    Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting\n\n     We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. \n    \n     Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. \n\n     The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool. \n\n     I will probably never stay at the Excalibur again it is out dated and under staffed to keep up on the hotel and casino. This will contribute to further deterioration of the casino. (Resort fee?) Ha what resort? Small uprade to motel 6 but with a casino inside."
0,"If you are a human being and thus may at some point after midnight need to pee or poop, don't eat here. The restaurant is open until 3 or 4 a.m. and is quite willing to take your money and serve you food and biiiiiiiiig giant sodas, but beware...their restroom closes at midnight. \n\nI couldn't believe that as a customer, eating in, I was not allowed to use the restroom. Is that even legal?? \n\nI asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go \""next door to Fat Tuesday\"". \nThere are 2 MAJOR issues with that:\n1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders.\n2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.\n\nI'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me. So...lucky for you Jimmy Johns...I was born without a penis. You win the prize of no pee on your floor, but you will never win my business EVER again."
0,Messed up my order not once but twice. Food was decent but I probably won't be coming back
1,"Simply put, this store is amazing. Stylish, classy, and comfortable clothing at VERY reasonable prices. They have a lot of workout gear, in addition to everyday clothing. My parents sent me several things from here for my birthday last month, and my mom wanted to take me on my recent visit since I loved everything they sent. They had a great sale going on, and I can tell you I did not leave empty handed (good thing I had half of an empty suitcase to fill)!! All of the clothing sold here is incredibly comfortable and is good for the young and not-so-young. The employees are super friendly and give honest opinions on what looks good- or not.\n\nI hope they open more of these stores across the country!"
0,"Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw ,toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh, but bland bland and more bland !! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back."
0,"I probably would have given this place a 3 star for their AVERAGE food, except the service was REALLY BAD when I went. Just a tip for the guys @ New Shanghai, do not argue with your customers in front of other customers and expect to get a nice tip. Hey server guy, do not expect to vent to your customers about your stupid boss and expect my sympathy. No bueno.\n\nThis place gives Chinese restaurants a bad name. SHAME ON YOU new shanghai! Never again!!"
1,"Great place to shop, the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better. The outside patio is a nice place to read the paper in the morning.\n\nThe staff is top notch and cares about the customers compared to other markets in town. For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent, so is the salad bar, and deli selections.\n\nThere is no negative to shopping here, unless you are using it as your main supermarket, then things can get pricey."
1,"As a recent transplant from Chicago, I was looking for a great handyman and Chris is just that. He's thoughtful, funny and very thorough. I'd hire him again in an instant and recommend him to anyone needs a hand"
1,Still the only place in the world I have been where I can get hot milk tea infused with red bean and mung bean flavor. Heaven
0,"This place is just absolutely horrible. Went in to check it out and have some dinner. 45 minute wait not a big deal, decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. I was looked at and past over by 3 different bartenders (presumably because I am a female). Word of advise ladies- we will tip you well also as long as you give good service. Two gentlemen at the bar had to ask the bartender for the drinks I wanted because I was being ignored. \n\nBuzzer for table goes off right as I got the drinks.  Get shown to the table (good thing I got two drinks at the bar), it took 10 to 15 minutes for the server to show up.  And talk about stupid.  I understand the concept of the restaurant but seriously train your staff better.   We were going to order a bunch of starters (what they call teasers). There menu is not that big.  Ordered soft pretzels,  they wes out.  Ordered pulled pork sliders,  server said I think we might be out,  can you go check so we can make a decision.  Yep, they were out. Asked the server,  what do you have?  She says everything else. Ok.  What kind of fish is used for the fish tacos,  oh we are out of fish, but if we had it tilapia.  (How do you run out of half the items in your menu? ) Do you have any wine?  Yes,  chardonnay and white zinfandel.  Do you have any red wine?  Yes, it's a cabernet, I think.   Food was so so. \n\nTime to pay the bill, have her $32 in cash asked for the rest to be put on a debit card.  Only puts in$22 in cash and the rest on a credit card.  Called her over,  told her the mistake and she gets mad at us.  Sorry darlin' you were not worth the $10 you tried to pocket.  \n\nAgain ladies,  just because we are not interested in your Twin Peaks doesn't mean that you have to ignore us and give us crappy,  no horrific service.  If you givegood serviceyou willbe tipped well.  Gengerally 20-30%.  We are all in the industry and if you worked for me you wouldn't have a job."
1,"I love this place too, I also want to support them.  Best service and delicious food"
0,"BEWARE!!!!\n\nI HAVE BEEN TO BEAUTY BRANDS SPA SERVICES TWICE AND HAVE BEEN OVER CHARGED BOTH TIMES!!!  That's 100% of the time!!!  The first time, my mother-in-law took my daughter to get a haircut, I had called twice- once to check availability and once to book the appointment, and both times I confirmed the price.  When my mother-in-law came back I saw the receipt and saw that they had overcharged us by $10.  I did contact them and they refunded me the $10.\n\nI decided to give them another chance and took my daughter back there to get a manicure a few weeks later, again I confirmed the appointment and price when I called.  We arrived 5 minutes before the her appointment time.  She was checked in, and then we waited.  The staff walked by us numerous times, two of them including the manager, were chatting at the desk behind us most of the time.  Finally, 15 minutes after the appointment was suppose to start, I went back to the desk, to confirm the appointment time.  The manager who had checked my daughter in acted like she had never seen us before.  I confirmed that her appointment was at 1:00pm, she said yes.  When I mentioned that it was now 1:20, she said she would check on things.  My daughter was taken back at 1:25.  When she came out, her nails were completely wet.  She said they didn't have a dryer- kinda surprised since they say they are a spa.  She also had hang nail, that they didn't even clip.  As we were checking out I noticed they had charged me $29 instead of the $17 they had quoted me.  Then the girl checking me out, pulled out their brochure and showed me where it said $29, but the brochure said that was for a pedicure.  I pointed that out to her, and she changed the price back to $17. \n\nWe then went home where my daughter waited 2 hours before doing anything so her nails could dry.  Then at 5pm, ( 3 hours after we left), she went to reach for something and the polish came of the center of her thumb nail!  \n\nI won't be going back.  If they overcharge the same customer twice, it's pretty obvious this is their usual standard of operation."

1,"We got there around 10 am on Sunday.   We were seated right away and got a booth.  Our waitress was most delightful.  Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive. \n\nFood came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large. \n\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait."
0,"Worst club ever. We were in the front of the guest list line and still had to wait a whole hour to get in to the damn place. Being a girl in heels, this was miserable. Then, once you get in, more lines. What is this...Disneyland?? When we finally made it in, we had to sit down because we had been standing so long in our heels. Problem was, no place to sit. Just stairs and open floor. What the hell kind of club is this? So we tried sitting on the edge of a booth and immediately got kicked off. Seriously? Dont you want girls to like your club? Dumbest place ever. They have a huge ego or something. Its all hype. You'll have way more fun anywhere else."
1,"I dined here with several colleagues earlier this year.  I have little to say other than the service was flat-out fantastic and the food was top-notch.\n\nThe owner went out of his way to help us obtain some wine for the table since all the stores were closed (my working assumption is that someone working at the restaurant \""dontated\"" it), as well as some very special personal assistance in helping us get back to our hotel when taxi service was unreliable.\n\nThe food, wow.  I have not had calamari quite like they did it before or since, and it was fantastic.  I don't remember what I ordered for my main, but do remember not being disappointed.  Our table got quite a sampling of things and everyone was pleased, so I'm not sure you can go too wrong with the Italian fare.\n\nHighly recommended."
0,"Oh, and if it doesn't bother anyone, they raised our rent over $100.  I would be fine with it if the value went up since I moved in, but the value of the property has not only gone down with depreciation, it is now a 15 year old property, and we do not have an office, a gym, nor a pool. So, my husband and I, who have just graduated college and barely could afford rent anyways, now have to figure out how to pay more.  Their pricing model has changed on the property in that they are now a competitively-based pricing model.  Once they match with the surrounding properties, they only thing to differentiate them will be the value of the property and the \""extras\"" they offer... Which is none.  So, good luck keeping up your vacancy rate when leases are up.\nMozel Tov."
0,"If you live in vegas, the best place to shop is NOT the forum shops. Sure they have an Apple Store, but there is another one, not too far away at Town Center, that has a friendlier staff. This whole mall is just a big tourist trap.\nFirst you go in, depending on where you enter at, and it feels like you are being herded around like a flock of sheep. You literally have one of two directions you can go, forward or backwards. There is no way to get from one store to another, unless you pass every store between to get to it, unlike a regular mall which has \""branches\"" of hallways or interconnection hallways that run parallel to one another.\nOn top of that, the prices here are RIDICULOUS. Who can justify paying $12 for coffe, when at most, when you hit Starbuck, you are looking at $5. And not even gourmet coffee, crap coffee. Even the Apple Store has higher prices here, for the same computer you can get 4 miles away. Don't even get me started on clothing. If you really want to spend.... your life's savings, on your next shirt, go for it. More power to you. I mean I make a decent pay, but this whole place is a joke when it comes to pricing. \nThe only saving grace about this whole place is the cool statue guys that stand still for hours on end for tips. You can literally fake punch them, tell them jokes, dance in front of them, fake fall in front of them, and they won't move. They are great. Besides that this place is basically just another location for tourists to throw money away."
1,"When it comes to window tinting Dan is simply the best. He uses high quality film unlike other tint companies. \nEven if he's not close to your home or office, he's worth the trip to get it done right at a competitive price. I've been a car broker for over 20 years and he's my tint guy. \nThanks Dan !"
0,"I used to come here weekly, and always when my dad was in town.  Their food was incredible (almost anything on the menu made dad sublimely happy and he's a mega-foodie), their service was so... Greek-like, and the ambience was perfection.\nA couple months ago, Dad came to town and insisted we go, it had been too long for him and he was craving it. A big fan of the Moussaka and Oso buco, he ordered what they had on special... and was gravely disappointed.  My salad was bleh, and I mostly just picked at it.  Their whole make-you-feel-like-family vibe had vanished, apparently it was renovated with the interior.  Speaking of, the interior renovations... they did a great job making it look like every other place in Old Town.\nI have no idea who is running things, but a pink slip is on order. Pronto!"
0,"So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  \n\nLunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.\n\nCo-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.\nTM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??\nMe:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.\nTM says she'll be back, and walks away.\nMe and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)\n\nWe finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response."
0,"About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid."
0,"I've been there a few times and I just don't understand? \n\nThis place has potential with location,ambiance and staff but the food is horrible.\n\nI wanted to like this place as it's in a great and convenient location. I've been here 4 times and still have not found one thing that's decent on the menu. This last time I was there I had the chicken sandwich on their homemade bread. The chicken was over cooked and the bread was not good either. Everyone in our party did not like their food. For desert they had ice cream, that came out melted and served that way. How do you mess up ice cream?? \n\nPlenty of restaurants to eat in the neighborhood and unfortunately this one is my least favorite."

0,"So, we had an offer to stay at a friends house for the night and we now regret passing it up. I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic. Driving in from the Denver area, I asked my girlfriend to look for a place close to the airport. She found this place on Google with very good reviews. I'm not sure why she didn't use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \""Google Knows everything\"" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \""I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn't been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\"" Her response was, \""we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don't have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\"" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it's just one night and I don't feel like driving to another hotel. After sitting on the old, run down, uncomfortable love seat watching TV for a while, I said, we should probably move to the bed as it has to be better than this seat. So, we got ready for bed and pulled the comforter back to find sheets that must have been queen size because they definitely didn't fit this king size bed. Whatever, hey the bed has like six pillows on it and two extra in the closet. Great, not, the pillows were plentiful, however they're about half the size of a normal pillow. Okay, I'm tired of trashing the place. Have a look at the pictures (worth a thousand words.) I'm sure with some true renovations, this will be a decent place to stay. I would guess the very good reviews this place has received are the work of some reputation building company or maybe we did just receive one of the older rooms and they didn't want to relocate us. Not returning anytime soon.\n\nStayed October 2013"

0,"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
1,I tried this place on a recommendation of a friend. Their frozen yogurt is really good. The peanut butter flavor was rich and creamy. They also had a wide array of toppings. The only downfall is they were a bit pricey. I had the small cup whcich was not even full but once it was weighed cost almost 4 dollars. I would still say very yummy and worth trying.
0,"If you're here on business and in a hurry, beware!  The service is very slow.  You can choose the buffet, which is very pricey and doesn't include coffee or juice, and that's a little quicker.  They seem to be perpetually short-staffed in the morning.  I guess that Bally's figures that since this restaurant is the only game in town - or at least in the hotel - for breakfast, they don't need to make an effort to please their guests.\n\nThey are slow to seat guests.  One of the waiters is terribly rude, although the waitress on the last visit was delightful and did her best in trying circumstances. \n\nIf you stay at Bally's, you either need to get up a lot earlier than you normally would or plan to skip breakfast.\n\nThere's a coffee cart near check-in, but there's no information about it, so if you don't see it, you won't know it's there. I wish I'd known about it earlier in my stay."
1,It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.
0,"This place was just ok. The bests parts were lounging by the pool and the restaurant was excellent!\n\nThere were several disappointments though:\n\n- I was hoping to read on the rooftop in the morning, but they were doing construction on it (Saturday and Sunday morning, starting before 7am!). It woke us up and also caused power flickers/outages across the hotel. We never got to enjoy the rooftop, and weren't told about the construction when we checked in.\n\n- The $20 per night service fee wasn't exactly as promised. We learned that you have to explicitly ask at the front desk for everything that fee covers and they'll give it to you, if they have it...\n\n- Part of the fee covered sunscreen, which would have been great for the pool! They didn't have any though. When they run out they should get more, sunscreen would make trips to their pool so much better!\n\n- According to their web site the fee was also supposed to include a $20 gift card (per night) towards a future stay, but we didn't get it. I called the hotel to ask and they said they don't do that anymore. I left a message for the owner (at the same number) and within minutes the hotel called me back. Further proof that you really do need to ask for everything the service fee promises. I took a star off for this, but I'll give it back if the actually send me a gift card. Update: they said I could remind them next time and they'd take $20 off. Fail! I'm taking another star off, and I won't be staying here again.\n\n- The cheaper rooms overlook the pool, which is open 6am-midnight. The pool guests were pretty quiet, but the elevator music for the pool was not! We could hear it loud and clear in our room. Oddly enough I didn't even notice it when we were at the pool.\n\n- We booked through hotels.com, which said the hotel had microwaves in the rooms. Not true."
1,"Thanks Yelp/Siri for helping me find this place. Being a California transplant in Hawaii, I get Mexican food withdraw. Rivas fit the bill. Affordable and freshly made mexican food...with drive thru!\n\nLike others say, the place looks closed but its just uber tinted. The inside is very clean and they have two big screens with sports on. I was just stoked that I got 12 Rolled Tacos/Taquitos smothered with fresh guacamole and cheese for $7.15. WHAT??? Do ya'll know how much this would cost me in Hawaii and it wouldn't even be that good???? Sigh...\n\nAgain, just happy to have found my easy-breezy, Mexican food option when I visit my in-laws in surprise. Until next year Rivas...I hope you don't close down."
0,Not really a fan of anything they offered food and service was not even worth writing a full review!!

1,"Great diner to stop in and enjoy hefty portions of breakfast food while you're chilling in Henderson, NV.\n\nWe stopped in on a busy Sunday morning and only had to wait for about 15 min before we were seated. They're pretty fast and efficient here, and I'm talking about the local customers not just the servers. :P\n\n-Eggs are cooked well.\n-House potatoes were BOMB diggity! I totally thought I was going to pass on these but they're like thinly sliced potatoes sauted lightly with some salt and pepper. I ate them like chips! \n-Pumpkin bread was moist and delicious as well.\n\nDefinitely a diner we will return to if we're ever in this area again. \n\nSide note: If you're sort of a \""health freak\"" but you do enjoy diner food, bring your own packets of Stevia to sweeten your coffee. They only carry the \""bad sh*t\"" here (Sweet'N Low or)."
1,"I really really like Superdrug. \n\nIts has all the things I need to get, to stock up on my make up and get all my beauty requirements and believe me that is alot ! :D. Very central in town I never have to wait long before getting served...also love their vast array of nail polishes.."
0,"I've been talking about this search for the perfect reuben for so long that people are starting to wonder. I figured that I'd better start documenting this search lest people begin to question my dedication to the task at hand.\n\nI hadn't been to Ella's since I relocated to Madison 7yrs. ago. So I figured that this Madison Institution would be a good place to start. So, the sandwich was pretty decent. The corned beef was delicious and not too greasy. I don't know why they don't serve it on a dark rye, like most every other place I've had one (we'll forget the sourdough I had once in the north woods). Loss of points here. My only other gripe would be that they could have spared some fries and made a bigger sandwich.\n\nThe reason for the two star rating is the service I received. I was one of maybe four customers in the whole place (everyone else was already seated and eating when I arrived), and it still took ten minutes for a staffer to bring a cup of water. The server's demeanor was short and far from sweet.\n\nSo, bring the kids to Ella's. That's the demographic they're going for. It's like Chuck-E-Cheese for the pre-teen steampunk crowd. If you're looking for a decent reuben in Madison, get it to go."
1,"If my world were calorie and cholesterol free, I'd dine every day on the trout.  Not to mention the coconut flan!  If you don't try that flan on one of your visits I pity your taste buds.  Food is always hot and fresh.  Server is usually the same and pretty friendly.  The guy will work his buns off to make you happy.  Meals are reasonably priced but worth the bit of splurge.  What to try?  The Ecuadorean tamales, the trout and the coconut flan.  You will love the red onion relish - I could eat that stuff every day!"
1,Banana bread was delicious and the Mediterranean omelet with shrimp and lobster inside was amazing.
0,The weekend crew is good. Tuesday around 7pm not so snappy. Sticking to the weekend program.

1,"Went out wiith hubby and two great friends to Sat to San Tan Flat. I am going to give 4 stars because I am  definitely a fan of this place. I love the fun atmosphere. I love the live music. I also love that it is close to my house. The owner is awesome, could not meet a nicer guy and normally I like most of the staff as well. The last couple visits though, Sat included my visit has not been as enjoyable as it used to be. For those that do not know me, just trust me when I say that I am anything but a hard to please person. I am a very friendly  person as well . I don't know why but the last couple visits the staff there has just not been very friendly. I ordered a drink from the bar and the girl there that took my order did not smile or even look up hardly when I smiled and  ordered a margarita on the rocks with extra salt.I then thought oh maybe she is just distracted so I smiled again and said Thankyou  and she still barely looked up and said mm hmm in a sort of annoyed tone.Even at checkout(we had a tab) she was her unfriendly self.The other bar tender I noticed with other people was not much better. My husband even tipped her well, against my advice since the drinks were lousy. My friends and hubby had beer. Normally I order margaritas they are my fave. The drink was not so good and at $8 a drink it should not taste like it is watered lemonade. I ordered a second thinking maybe it will be better second time. Nope still the same. Maybe the owner needs to talk to his people about the service and the drinks.(I also recall every awesome drink I have ever had he has been there)One of the things I have always liked about the place is that is seems like a good hangout.I am from Oklahoma where everyone is your friend until you give them a reason not to be.I don't like snotty bars. I like real fun friendly places. We love this place though hopefully things will go back to what they used to be"
0,"We had a Groupon...my wife loves Australia...and has family from there. Let's just say...we were excited. We ordered all the unique items: surf&turf (with Kangaroo-loin meat), shrimp-on-the-barbie, and the crocodile dumplings. The dumplings were nothing special...a bit over-seasoned and fried from what seemed like pre-packaged, frozen dumplings from Costco. The main dishes looked great...but the shrimp was a bit \""old\""...the loin was bland and tough...the small side salad was a delicious bit of redemption, however, with a sweet, creamy-in-texture, balsamic vinaigrette of sorts. With all that mediocrity, I must admit that the wine was delicious (we had the Shiraz and the CabSav)...and the bar gave an extremely generous pour for the price.  I hope they up their game, because there is a lot of potential."

0,"This Krispy Kreme bums me out. The stars are for sheer convenience. I've gone 3 times before work because it's on my way, they have a drive-thru and it opens at 5:30, which is nice for us early risers.\n\nThings that aren't nice: \n\nMajor inconsistency. I know it's just opening, but they should have some sort of supervision for quality control..Once my creamer/sugar/stirrer/napkins were tidily put into a little bag, other times they hand them to me like a kid scooping dirt out of a sandbox with two hands. Twice I didn't get anything to stir my coffee with and everything just settled to the bottom.. depressing.\n\nI swear I didn't once get the donut I ordered. Most disappointingly, they once gave me a cake donut. Who orders a cake donut at Krispy Kreme? Cold, hard, blah. It defeats the entire purpose."

1,Stopped by Aria during EDC weekend to aid my hangover from Marquee and WOW this place was rockin! We saw Cazzette performing and everyone seemed to be throughly enjoying themselves. They offered ok deals on drinks. $30 will get you a huge 32oz margarita in a souvenir cup which was  enough to keep me feeling good for another couple hours and they provided free bag checking. I haven't been to any other pool parties so I'm not sure how rowdy other crowds get but security was pretty on point at this venue (almost too much they stopped people from dancing in certain areas.) Definitely will be coming back although I really would like to try Encore Rehab or Wet Republic first.
0,"Probably the worst resort- casino stay. \nUpgraded room was smoking room. :(\nValet parking the car was a nightmare almost every nite. Food at raffles so awful. Tried it 2x. Cking out the worst ever. Uncaring, and uninformed. \nThe room was suppose to be renovated. Not. The only toiletries were shampoo, conditioner, lotion. No newspaper. \nThe pool....agh, what pool?? This is thanksgiving weekend. Open up a bigger pool please. Geeze. And no one seemed sorry or to care. Seemed like the workers didn't like it there either. \nWe go to Vegas 2x a year and always have a memorable stay. This time, the memory is negative towards this Casino. \nObviously never again. \nLow class place now."
1,"I joined Truliant years ago primarily to obtain an car loan.  The process was simple and convenient.  My credit was not so good at the time, but they did give me the loan, as well as a subsequent one, both of which helped to improve my credit.  Everyone working here is super nice as they know that the members own the credit union, rather than a bank where investors own it.  The location is convenient - right off of 77 at Tyvola.  The coolest thing they have done recently is eliminate the need for deposit and withdrawal slips if you make transactions inside the branch.  Also, you can make deposits for other local credit u ions here which is nice.\n\nOn the rare occasions I have to call and talk to somebody, I talk to someone with a southern accent rather than someone from halfway around the world that I can barely understand.  They are based out of Winston-Salem, NC, so it is great to have them in the QC.\n\nMy only very minor complaint is that they don't have one of those machines that counts coins as most credit unions do."
0,Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them.
0,"Seriously? The name says it all! \n\nThis place is like the worst, darkest most horrifying section of HELL!\n\nThis review is for the buffet restaurant only. \n\nMy friend (who I'm not in touch with anymore) dragged me here on our last day of vacation. Oh boy...\n\nThe place is the trashiest, the public are red nacks or white trash old people who burnt all of their money in gambling in the shittiest casinos & therfore dont have the budget or the class to go anywhere else! \nThe servers are bunch of ladies who are the age of my grandma yet they still work instead of enjoying their last days on the beach in Florida! Or they might be young but aged dramatically due to excessive drinking, smoking, tanning etc. \nNot fun, the whole place looks like a geriatric department in a shitty hospital!\n\nFood-  Do not dare!! Makes hometown buffet taste like a gourmet 5 star meal! It's tastless, greasy & the lowest quality it can be, \nI'll prefer any airlines food over this crap!\n\nServers - Slow, rood, tired, ugly & then they just disappear.\n\nHealth - After eating 1/3 portion of eggs & meat, I had to run to the restrooms with a diarrhea & seat there for 2 hours! \nWhy am I abusing my body for eating in those kinda places???\n\nRestrooms - Similar to the ones in India, if you ever been, you probably know what I'm talking about!\nNASTY, Stinky & has lots of shit on the floor, literally.\n\nOh boy, I was happy to get back home!\n\nIf you are into white trash, red necks, old women who can't walk since their so fat that they cant carry themselves anymore, if you want your food to taste like a processed ashtray, then by all means, go for it. I would go just so I could watch this circus!\n\nBottom line, the place is a geriatric department!  \nAnd, You get what you pay for!\n\nYalla Bahhh! Yak."
1,"We went to the Urban Sip after having a fantastic meal at BLT. My friends had been talking this place up, and I wasn't disappointed. \nThere are a ton of really fantastic glasses of wine on the menu. Whether you want an 80 dollar glass of Opus One or a 12 dollar glass of Washington Riesling, the wine menu has something for everyone.\nTry the wine flights. They have some really fantastic options on the flights. We tried the Chardonnay and Pinot flights and each of the wines were unique and were excellent choices.\nCakebread Chard by the glass isn't cheap (25 bucks) but is worth a splurge. This place is so cool that we might go back tonight!"
1,"Of course in Las Vegas you have your choice of wonderful food. It's rare to have a below average meal here. \n\nBOA and Craftsteak really stand out in Vegas as far as Steakhouses go. My experience at BOA was extraordinary. The hostess sat us on the balcony overlooking the strip, including the Bellagio Fountains- we had the best seat on the strip for that show while sipping the most amazing cocktail I have EVER had. Their signature cocktail has won awards and understandably so. The ingredients may sounds strange- namely the balsamic vinegar, but they work so well together I could have had 6 of them (and almost did)!\n\nTheir table side Caesar Salad is phenomenal as well. Of course their Steaks are great, but what really sets them apart is the small things, like the salad and their cocktails. I'll be sure to visit BOA again. Absolutely wonderful."
1,"This is my new favorite store for workout attire.  Not only are the materials of the highest quality (they have made it through several washes and still look brand new) but everything fits perfectly. At 6'5\"" 200lbs I have a hard time finding clothes that fit. Particularly long sleeve shirts with sleeves long enough at the arms without being too baggy around the waist. \n\nAnd the staff here are incredible helpful. I felt like I had my own personal shopping assistant trying her best to ensure I found just the right items.  \n\nThe only downside is that everything is expensive. On the flipside the clothes seem very durable. I have a hunch I may end up saving money in the long run. \n\nAnd lastly - they actually have size 14 socks. And the most comfortable socks I have ever worn. Amazing!"
0,"I haven't been here in a really long time. This place has been in Green Valley longer than any other place I think. It was just terrible.The walls are a dingy yellow, with plaster repair spots all over. The plastic holder on our table was so dirty it stuck to my fingers, and you could hardly read through it. I ordered the crab enchilladas. They used mealy ground up canned crab meat that tasted like crap. Stale old rice and beans. None of the food at our table looked good, my friends said it was OK. There are many mexican places in town, I won't be coming back here. The best part of the meal was the margarita, large is $13, no thanks."
1,"Good food, lots to pick from on buffet.  Great for the kids."
1,"Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!"
1,"Random Mexican food place that's pretty decent.  My Australian friend and I were in Phoenix for a night during our 2 week road trip.  This place got recommended to us by the hotel guy based on pure proximity, but also for being pretty good.  Despite some semi-shady characters chillin' out front, the place was neat and clean.  The staff was friendly.  The food was also fairly decent.  We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it.  You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid.  All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.  If I ever find myself there again, I'll grab a taco or 2..."
1,"I came here as a recommendation from a friend, because I was getting tired of the ridiculous prices the big companies like Firestone and Midas were trying to charge me for work done that usually required more work in the near future!\n\nThey have AMAZING service, it's owned by a Japanese couple, who are very friendly and accommodating. I've take my car here twice, the first was to take a look at the control arm bushings, ball barings, structs, and suspension. They told me all I need to do is replace the control arm bushings, which costed at a fraction of what Firestone quoted me!! \n\nSecond time, was a bit of an emergency, my window regulator snapped and the window dropped. This posed as a safety to my car so I brought it in the moment it happened, they took a look at it, told me what it was and gave me a quote. They told me they could do it that day and finish before the shop closed! Which was a saver because it was Friday and they close on the weekends!!\n\nThey also use genuine parts from whatever manufacture your car is from! Best thing to do is go in for an estimate and set up an appointment for later in the week if it's not urgent. \n\nThe gentlemen that works in the office along with the owner's wife was very helpful both times and remembered who I was, he also speaks multiple languages!"

0,"Beware of the \""Cat nazi Lady\"" my Family and I went there to adopt a cat for our home and she was rude and impolite to us and wouldn't  show us the cat we picked out from the window. This lady should be checked out in a psycho ward lol. Poor cat would've have a very nice home."
1,"The burger was the best I've ever had, had the Poblano. Everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch. Unfortunately I waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period, the service was abysmal. But, I will be back for the burgers. If not for the service, would have been five stars."
1,"Stayed here this past weekend and had a great time. I went to Vegas but only once left the hotel (somehow I ended up on the strip outside the wynn after a night of hard partying...still no idea how that happened). Our daily routine was order lunch via room service at 3pm (waking time) then champagne, then champagne again then have the minibar restocked from the previous nights damage....and  proceed to clean it out again. Around 10-11ish we would leave the room to go to XS and around 4am we would hit the tables. Would have been nice to see more (any) of vegas but we had a great time...until we got the room bill. Our hotel room fee was $700 and room service was $800...we didnt feel so big anymore....we transformed from rock stars to nervous teens who had crashed the family car.\nanyway if you choose to go down the same path we did - get the burger sliders (they are ground beef at its finest) with perfect onion strings, also every bottle of champagne was delish and im sure if you want to save some money (in retrospect, always a good idea) you probably wouldnt be able to differentiate the champagne from the sparkling wine. oh, and they have a room service \""happy hour\"" with corona's $5 each and some of the food for $10 a plate which is not bad compared to the regular price, trust me..."
0,The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though.
0,Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back.
1,"Always a fan of outlets - especially when they carry name branded stores. Tory Burch, Lacoste, Nike Factory, etc. It was really crowded when we went - given it was St. Patrick's day. \n\nFirst time here though. Next time we're going to explore the South one."
0,"Some of the worst service ever.  I called to cancel service and was transferred to retension.  After 53 minutes on the phone and trying to cancel service, I somehow agreed to keep the service for 6 months at a significantly reduced rate.  I then recieved  the bill the next month and the price had no change.  I called and they wrote in there notes some  othert agreement.  I asked to speak to manager and they denied me.  I told them I want my service canceled now and that I was not going to pay the bill.  They said no.  I asked for the manager he said no.  He then said if I ask for manager he will need to hang up.  He hung up.  His name is Jesus and will not give any other identification to me.  He is in the retention department.  If you are the manager of this employee, please review his work."
0,"Air hostesses were nice, but barely attentive during a long flight. Would have appreciated a bit more attention, but okay, it was a red eye and most people were asleep. Did not like that although I required assistance with boarding, when I asked for a set change from middle seat, I was given the absolute last row on the plane. Spent the night listening to two air hostesses talking about their lives. They could have told me that in the first place and I would have stayed where I was, instead of being completely uncomfortable for 4 hours. I don't like them compared to other airlines, but they had a flight that suited my schedule."
0,"Ok this is the way to get to Vegas, and this is the tourist mecca.  It was glitzy years ago but is now a bit divey and not so easy to get around.  I am not sure how else you would get to Vegas unless you want to brave the drive but the airport will not be the highlight of your trip."
0,"The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back."
1,"Love Sir Ed's!  They have the best veggie burger in town.  It reminds me of Cheers....once you visit a few times, they know your name and your drink.  I like their eclectic menu and love that they serve it late night.  Overall, great relaxed bar atmosphere complete with darts and good tunes in the juke box.  Great \""locals\"" spot!  Even better now that it's non-smoking.  That was only thing that bothered me about the place before."
1,"Second large group experience here.\n\nOut with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)\n\nThe wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.  \n\nI was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.\n\n\nEDIT: \nIf you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.\n\nIf you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you."
0,"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South."
0,"This gym is not always packed, but nobody ever bothers to put their weights back where they go.  It's always a mess and usually difficult to find the dumbbell or EZ barbell weights you are looking for, because someone has left them in a different part of the gym.  I've never seen one staff member try and keep the place somewhat organized. It's usually a disaster.  I'd rather drive further to a different location to avoid frustration at this gym."
0,Blueprint needs some work. The feel of the restaurant is all over the place. They need to get one theme and stick with it. The food is average at best as well. Today was the second time I have eaten at Bluprint. The brunch prices are way to expensive for the portion size and quality of the food. They don't use fresh ingredients and charge prices like they do. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros and both were $15. The burrito was very small and had bad store bought sliced sausage and maybe 10 black beans. The shell was so big all you ate was that and nothing else. The hash browns were bad as well. They didn't have any flavor. The huevos were set in front of us and the first thing is saw were un cooked eggs. How the cook sent that out to a table I will never know. The white of the egg was still clear! We mentioned it to the manager and he said he would fix it. After talking about the price and the poor quality of the food we had already ate we decided to get up and leave. We paid for the burrito and left. That is the first time i have ever done that. If you are going to charge $15 for breakfast items they better be great with fresh ingredients or good and big portions. This place is neither. Bluprint won't be around if they don't change and do it quick.
0,"I normally don't like to rag on a place but have been coming here for a while because the food is excellent. Excellent. But, the service has been consistently worse and worse. I'm not one to rag on a family place for bad service -- normally I'm not expecting super fast highway food. But, this place is getting to the point of ridiculous. Took us an hour and a half for dinner the other night. Not terribly busy. One server who was friendly and one busser who was doing... what? We couldn't figure out. Also, as one commentor noted, they'll let the phone ring and ring and ring without picking it up if too busy. Drove my boyfriend nuts and definitely made for a less than stellar meal. \n\nWill we be back again? Likely. The food is fantastic. But we'll probably only go when we have an hour+ to spare."
1,"Benjarong is one of our favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Not only is the food authentic and delicious (their heat scale is very accurate), but the service is really attentive and always consistent. We especially love the Pad Thai, won ton soup, Thom Yum soup and pineapple fried rice. An excellent place for a lunch date or with coworkers or family."
1,Love this place! I'm obsessed with burritos and these by far are amazing. They have many different options and they will make pretty much anything you want. The employees are very friendly and it seems to be a family-owned business. They offer many different options/sauces that you can't get at the chains. I've been several times and recommend trying this place out!
0,"I had dinner at Hawk's while visiting Madison during a conference, and I chose it because it had vegetables on the menu, and those seem hard to find behind all the friend cheese curds in this town (believe me- not a complaint). This place is definitely straightforward, no frills, nothing special with the food. My husband and I both got salads, and they were pretty mediocre.   \nAlso, my main disappointment is that the beer menu doesn't list all the beers! I had the bartender recommend something for me, which turned out to be fine, but a few minutes later I saw  a waitress bring someone else the Leinenkugels Honey Wheat that I had been searching for! I saw it listed nowhere on the menu! Ugh! Sadness. \nHawk's served its purpose in providing vegetables, but nothing special here!"
0,"Don't stay here unless you really have to. There is no internet wifi in the rooms, they give you a short jack to put into the side of your computer... too bad I only had my ipad. Not to mention that the TV channels suck. I would't complain about that if they just had some stinking wifi! I mean why make me pay resort fees for such a shitty hotel? Last but not least, there was a bug in my room my last day I stayed and never been back since. Save some extra cash and go elsewhere."
1,"Best nail place in Phoenix! Mimi did my acrylics, and let me tell you she took her time to do some good work. They are very beautiful despite that you can see the little red marks from my last nails but oh well. I will never go to another place! Ps. Happy hour is Mon-Thurs if u pay cash for ur pedi!"
0,"For the price that the Stratosphere still charges for you to stay here, you would think you were staying at the Mirage, or Treasure Island. I'm not saying those are top notch hotels on the strip but I can far better justify paying over $100 for a nice room in one of those than $139 in the Stratosphere.\n\nThe novelty of this place truly is its view, which I would only really recommend at night because during the day you see Vegas for the kind of dessert it really is. The night view is amazing, but the restaurant should be skipped because at $$$$ I was expecting my steak to dance for me. It didn't.\n\nThe casino is small and smokey, it's kind of old-ish and in need of renovation and the room really transported me back to the Sahara next door which I though the Stratosphere was a bit above. I think if you get this place for very very cheap, it would probably be an ok stay, despite the fact that it is quite further down the strip and you will have to drive.\n\nOtherwise, just come here for the night view and leave it at that."
1,"Being located right next to first year accommodation, Rush tailors itself perfectly to what first year students want to do- to get drunk and have a laugh. The drinks are dirt cheap, they do vodka and cokes at \u00a31, and although you can taste that the vodka is pretty rank and the coke is probably watered down, you can't really complain at a pound. The place could do with a good clean, but when it's dark it is less evident and the fact that everyone is half-cut, means that this little fact goes unnoticed by most. \nThe seats are comfy and pretty long so you can get a lot of mates around a table. They also have a couple of pool tables and a video console. Rush makes a good starting point for a night out before you head on to another few bars or off to a club."
1,Very fresh delicious chicken strips. . The texas toast is soft and delicious with just a slight toasted top .....very well worth the stop in VEGAS before heading home to los Angeles

0,"Dear Hyatt--\n\nIt's time . Phoenix is becoming , or at least trying to become a big city and you need to seriously consider some upgrades. You are looking dated and tired. I suggest getting inspired and moving into the now. \n\nHere are a few suggestions :\n\nGo up to the eighth floor look out onto the atrium look at the tile and carpet It's hodge podge  , stained and worn out. Ick! \n\nRemodel to  a  contemporary look that embraces the southwest feel. \n\nDo something bout the curtains in the suites they look  faded and have strings hanging from the hardware.\n\nScrape off the popcorn ceilings and clean the other ceilings , I can see dust hanging in places. \n\nShow off your elevators with flair and panache. \n\nLove and Kisses ,\nme"

0,"I chose the 4 Queens for my visit to Las Vegas for several reasons, and I'll admit a good lot of those involved the low price of the room. (Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard, the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor.)\n\nHowever, the quality of my room was far below what I expected, or even dreamed was possible.\n\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms; generally I only want them to be clean (not spotless, clean) and relatively safe. Non-smoking is also on the list.\n\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.\n\nThere was hair (of the nether-region variety) in the bathtub. In fact, I don't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay. I don't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself, and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\n\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy. I'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance (humor me) to make myself feel better.\n\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived, and spotted quite easily. This was touted to be a non-smoking room. I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff. \n\nNope; no such luck.\n\nAdditionally, there were cigarette burns in the bedding (which was made of some, scratchy, ugly cheap fabric). Two of the three lamps in the room did not work. At all. The remote did not work. The air conditioner was very, very loud.\n\nI didn't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we're being held in the city the weekend I stayed, and on the 15th floor, I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly. Granted, I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay, but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\nOh, and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay. I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\n\nLuckily, I take Ambien to sleep, and am dead to the world at night. Even with the Ambien, the world's rattliest, loudest air conditioner, still woke me up several times each night. This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having. Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\n\nUpdate! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining. Guess what? It got worse! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow (defying the laws of sound) louder, and played later into the evening. Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am, they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them. This went on until about 8 am. I pounded on the wall twice, called the front desk, and nothing was done! I didn't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\n\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am, five hours early for my flight, because the hotel was just that damn bad, and I couldn't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\n\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breaking-out."

1,"I am so glad I capped off 3 days in a row and 3 shows with Olivia!  She is my father's celebrity crush and when we found out she was debuting her show the last night he was in town, I got tickets during the pre-sale.  We got in line about 30 minutes before the show, which starts at 7:30 PM.  This is the same showroom that features Donny & Marie and George Wallace.\n\nWhile waiting in line, I realized I was perhaps 3 decades younger than everyone else, but what the heck!  We had balcony seats at a table.  We sat with a couple from Ontario, Canada.  Olivia was very conversational with the audience and had a band complete with a percussionist, bassist, drummer, and back-up vocalists, one of which played a variety of instruments including the fabulous flute, saxophone, and even harmonica.\n\nThe female back-up vocalist also helped Olivia with the majority of her on-stage costume changes, which was changing jackets primarily.  She only did one costume change at the end of the show before a 2-song finale, wearing head-to-toe gold sequins.\n\nShe sang songs from all aspects of her career, pre-Grease and post-Grease.  She is an Aussie who moved to England at 18 and sang in lounges.  She sang songs she was inspired by, like \""Cry Me a River\"" by Julie London (in V for Vendetta for my generation).  Olivia sang from Xanadu, from her country hits in her early days, songs from her 90s album Gaia, and of course...PHYSICAL!\n\nThe most excitement for the crowd came from her 4 minute montage of her life early in the show, with pictures hinting at the order of her career, and the nod to Grease.  She started with a tease of \""Look at me I'm Sandra Dee\"" and then broke into songs from Grease with her back-up singers: You're the One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, and We Go Together.  The crowd went wild!  Sure, there were songs throughout the show I did not know, but I did not grow up with ONJ so I was just thrilled to see my dad so happy.  Cool show no matter what generation you belong to, I'd say!"
1,Excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price.  You get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings. Thru also have pastas but I recommend subs they are better.
0,"Hi WALMART.... We recently were shopping at a location in Phoenix AZ. When we got home we noticed we were double charge for two items.\n\nWe then went back to the store and they refused to reimburse us for the double charges until they review their camera! We felt as though we were treated as criminals!\n\nWe waited for twenty mins as they questioned the cashier and \""reviewed the tapes\"" The employee t\nhen told us that the only person that could review the tapes was out and we needed to either wait 30min to see if he was back or come back at a later time!\n\nNow we must pack up our 2 month old and drive another 15 mins to come back and see if we will be reimburse for items we did not receive.\n\nNeedless to say mistakes happen, all well... but poor customer service does not need to. We will not longer seek to be a customer of walmart's."

0,"If your idea of a fun night in Vegas is a crowded, unorganized, dark and dingy club, then Haze is for you!\n\nI was highly UNIMPRESSED with this nightclub inside of the newly opened Aria. Here are some bullet points:\n\n-Try looking around at the queue outside the club. Is it filled with all the rejects of the better clubs around? You bet. I saw a girl wearing a hankerchief top and jean shorts and somehow, SOMEHOW she was let in without cover. That would not fly at XS or PURE. Jesus. The bouncers have absolutely no standards in dress code.\n\n-This place is a horrendous maze. If you're not getting shoved out of a hallway you're climbing stairs to find a bar or a dancefloor. It's like the people who designed this place are making you work for your drunken night of debauchery. F**k that! I want to get drunk and dance in the fastest and most fun way possible.\n\n-Haze is crowded and not in a good way. This is a new club, so people have to be let in, but it's like they let in everyone and their ugly cousin. Gross. Don't get me wrong; I am no supermodel, but I know how to clean up and have at least moved beyond the trashy years of college Vegas trips. I don't think I've seen that much dimpled ass-cheek hanging out in my entire life. . The place was so packed with nasty that I spent half the time rubbing elbows with the unwanted and poorly groomed. Blech.\n\nThank god we got free and VERY STRONG drinks and ditched this place. NEVER AGAIN HAZE. NEVER AGAIN."
1,Went here on a Saturday around 3ish and it was pretty busy. Parking was not an issue though which was good. The store itself is super nice and huge. They have tons and tons of stuff in and of course-at a great $1 price tag. The customer service was nice and I like how you can get balloons here unlike other Dollar Tree stores.
1,"I used to HATE going to burlington because it always looked like\nclothes, shoes and housewares threw up in a giant space and to find anything you had to wade in knee deep.\nWell, not anymore. They have great signage now that makes finding what you want easy peas-y!\nI was super pleasantly surprised. \nAs long as they keep the store looking as spiffed up as it is now.. \nI will undoubtedly be a frequent customer..!"
1,"Lobbys first grabbed my eye when dropping off a Blockbuster movie. The location had been vacant for some time after Extreme Pita left. I was excited to hear this was a burger place. \n\nI finally gave the place a try tonight and wasn't disappointed. I had the double burger with cheese. All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion, large pickles slices and homemade sauce on a sesame bun.\n\nThe meat is high quality (not frozen), seasoned  and cooked to perfection. Topped with cheese and you have a real delight. After I ate my burger, I wish I had more! \n\nI'm a big fan of the crinkle cut french fries. I haven't had those in a LONG time. I found the fries a bit too salty. I like salt on my fries, but this was a tad much. You receive a very large portion of fries (perfect for me). You could probably even split the fries with another person if you wanted. \n\nYou can make any meal a combo meal (fries/drink) for $2.79 more.\n\nThe price of the burgers and hots dogs are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  Based on the size you order, you're looking  at $4-6.50 w/o cheese.\n\nI do wish there was more than just 1 size of drink and not in a styrofoam container. I could go for something a little smaller than a super big gulf size-32 oz.\n\nI hope this place does well as they make great food. This isn't an ideal location unless you know about the place, but I think Lobbys can do well with some more publicity and word of mouth.  The reviews on Yelp are a good start.\n\nIf you like burgers as much as I do, give this place a shot! \n\n4.5 stars!"
0,"EDIT2: They charged my card AGAIN. I have now been charged four times for a one night stay. I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2012/9/4/162713/3521/vegas-travel/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements\n\nEDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.\n\nA representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. \n\nThen we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.\n\nThe employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, \""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.\""\n\nI simply replied, \""No.\"" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.\n\nI am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. \n\nI'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.\n________________________________________ \n\nI wish I could give this hotel NO stars. \n\nThe Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. \n\nThe first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.\n\nThey did refund me but then...\n\nOn August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under \""Specialty Retail,\"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.\n\nI informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she \""had no knowledge\"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.\n\nBasically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.\n\nI offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. \n\nAgain, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning."
0,"What the heck happened here?  I have used this car wash for years and have, for the most part,  been happy with the service.   Today I visited and it was the WORST!  Although there was next to nobody there, I did not get checked in, however when someone pulled in behind me, they got served right away.  I had to get out of my car in order to get someone's attention.   When I walked into the store I was hit in the face with the overpowering smell of Pinesol.  Seriously, you can't clean BEFORE you open?  The car wash was mediocre at best.   Usually the place is packed on a Sunday.   Now I know why it's a ghost town."
1,Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol
1,"Is there a more deliciously sinful cupcake in Las Vegas?  We've had them to our office twice now and each time, we are pleased with the timeliness of delivery and overjoyed by their tastiness.  Highly suggest if you're looking for alcohol infused cupcakes!"
0,"This review is for the location on Elliot only.  My husband and I visited and ordered the root beer float (there is alcohol in this) and a Diet Pepsi (seriously, Pepsi?  Get it together and put some Coke on the menu).  Root Beer Float was good, tasted like a root beer float, but managed to look like a glass of dirty milk.  Pepsi tasted like the fountain used water from the toilet.  \n\nDinner!  Yay!  Wait, noooooo.  Husband ordered the Chicken Parm and I ordered the stuffed rigatoni.  Both of these dishes came out with about a cup of fresh parsley sprinkled all over them.  Like the garnish, and literally a whole cup of it.  They also cut the stems up on it, but I'll get to that in a minute.  Lets start with the CHICKEN PARM.  First of all, it was a big breast of chicken, not a formed and processed patty of chicken asslips and beak.  The pasta with it was cooked only to the point of not crunchy.  And after the first bite my husband looked at me and said \""this tastes like they boiled the pasta in dirty water\"".  I have to say, I don't think it was the pasta, I think it is their sauce.  My rigatoni tasted funny.  The ricotta inside was creamy and tasted good, but I couldn't put my finger on what tasted funny.  Then, just as I had figured it out, I felt something hard and crunchy in my mouth. A HARD AND CRUNCHYTHING IN MY RIGATONI?  Did I lose a tooth?  Was it a bug?  Oh, it was just a huge chunk of parsly stem.  There was so much of this crunchy parsley stem in the dish and the taste of the sauce was horrible, I couldn't eat it.  The manager came out (I hate when this happens, I'm not trying to get a free meal, I just don't like the food.  Get over it).  She offered to make us a pizza.  The Chicago Style I saw at the next table looked good, but I was told that takes 40-50 mintues to bake.  SIgh, we got a small cheese and pepperoni thin crust.  \n\nThe pizza came out and it was just cheese.  The server that brought it informed us that the pepperoni was under the cheese.  I ate a piece and again, their sauce tastes like it was made with dirty tomatos from the garden, not good.  My husband choked down a few pieces of this and managed to find a piece of pepperoni under all that cheese.\n\nNeedless to say, I was upset as this location was not even close to the location in Tempe, or Camelback.  We won't go back and urge you to drive the extra 10 minutes eat at another one of their locations."
1,"The service is is always friendly. I am always able to walk in and talk to an associate and get a quote. This is also a place I trust and will not try to add extra unnecessary work to up the cost. I needed my whole AC unit replaced in my car. Fortunately Dan was willing to change it out for me. I still needed to take my car and get the AC vacuumed and charged. Since it was late in the evening Friday afternoon, I asked if I could just drop it off and pick it up the next day. They had my car ready pretty early Saturday! Best part is they did a great job on charging my AC! It runs so cold! I am no longer melting. I will for sure bring my car back, see y'all in a few months for inspection!"
1,"BoCa7 is an exotic Vietnamese restaurant that offers the traditional specialty of 7 courses of beef and fish.  As soon as you enter the space, you are enveloped in a sea of red... from the red orbs of light from above to the red mosaic tiling on the walls.  This place has a very bright and friendly feel while still maintaining a sense of the exotic.\n\nThe food is also fabulous--they offer a variety of dishes other than the 7 courses of beef and fish option.  Being a fan of red meat, I tried the cubed beef tenderloin with garlic and onions--this is served with a watercress salad and rice.  The slightly sweet and peppery marinated meat simply melts in your mouth.  \n\nWe also ordered one of the house specialties, the crispy skin oven roasted whole Catfish sprinkled with crushed peanuts, scallions, and carmelized onions. This dish is phenomenal and unlike any fish that I have had.  What I really enjoyed was the crispiness of the skin.  The Catfish meat was also very soft and delicate.  The dish is served with rice paper, mints, mixed greens, green banana and apple slices, and bean sprouts which you use to wrap the fish in.  \n\nThey also serve a variety of traditional desserts and specialty drinks, such as freshly squeezed coconut juice with lime.\n\nIt opened its doors just about two weeks ago and if the food is this good now, it can only get better.  It was late Saturday night when I dined here, and there were still a number of patrons in the restaurant.  If you want to try some non-typical Vietnamese food in a friendly, chill environment, this is a great pick."
1,I thought the frozen yogurt was good and the concept worked real well. People easily got their  frozen yogurt in a timely fashion and wow they were packed!
1,"My printer won't connect to my laptop. It's really annoying. It means I can't print simple documents. What do I do when I need these simple documents? I was worried that requesting a printing job for 40 sheets in black and white would seem too small. Not for Pace Print. They happily printed off 20 sheets, one-sided, black and white and then another 20 sheets black-and-white double-sided, at the grand total of \u00a36. Sure it's more expensive than if I had my printer up and running, but I was in a pickle and they happily did this for me.\n\nKudos to the staff member who served me. He was really friendly and helpful.\n\nI simply had to email them a PDF of my document and they emailed me once it was printed and ready to collect (in around half an hour). I really couldn't fault the service at all."
0,The brisket was quite good but too fatty. The french fries were alright but there wasn't enough ketchup. The service was slow and somewhat inattentive. There was no ambience in this restaurant. There was no music or mood lighting. FOXNews was on TV and it was just kind of dull. Overall I can say I won't be back.
1,Soooo... the gaggle reunited again for a Thai experience...  It did not fail. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly... check their pants out when you go... and YOU'RE WELCOME!  Can you say a mash up between a genie and MC Hammer!  They're awesome!  My dinner was fantastic!  I'm not going to lie...  Any dish can be made veggie friendly and that's exactly what I did with the eggplant something or nother! (Can't remember the name)  Not an single gaggle-member was dissatisfied with their meals.  I can tell by the empty plates!  Plenty of food for decent prices.  Definitely will be going back!  Get the medium if you want a little bit of a kick and if you venture for spicier... Good luck! :)
0,Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good.
0,"First, let me start by saying that getting hold of this place to make an appointment is extremely difficult. How hard is it to just answer the phone?\n\nAnyways, my old hairdresser had a baby and is no longer doing hair, so I went to groupon to find a deal (since going to a new place always scares me) and if I liked the place, hopefully make it my new salon. Anyways, the green room was having a groupon, so I bought it and then spent the whole day trying to get someone to answer the phone to book my appointment. I finally got an appointment with Juan, who I was told was really good. \n\nI went to my appointment, fairly nervous since I hadn't had anyone different colour my hair in 6 years, and waited to see Juan. He was friendly enough. You could tell he wasn't interested in talking. When he did ask me a question, he didn't even listen to my response. Anyways, I let him know I had the groupon and what I wanted done. I even had a picture of my hair right after I had gotten it done that he could reference. As far as the highlights go, he did an alright job. It was the cut and the treatment of my hair that was horrible and I will never go back because of it. He treated my hair like it he was working on a mannequin. I have a neck and actually can't hold my head up when you're ripping at it as hard as possible. It was absolutely horrible. He first dried my hair (while ripping at it) then started the cut. I have long, blonde hair. I like to keep it that way. So I asked him for the tiniest trim. I said 1/4 of an inch. I guess I was hoping he would treat my hair better, and dry cut the small amount I said, but no. He cut off a good 3 inches. He also cut layers into my hair which I never asked for. And, I have curly hair. He blow dryed it straight and that was that. He didn't run a straightener through it or anything. So I left the salon with an okay colour, shorter hair than I ever wanted, and a massive mane because he couldn't take the 5 extra minutes to straighten it. I suppose maybe that was a good thing. I am not sure my head could take the extra pounding. \n\nAll I know is I will be finding a new salon to get my hair done.\n\n\nAnd in reply to Eric's comment, firstly, as a business owner, don't you think the most appropriate response would have been \""sorry- we strive for perfection. good luck in your search for a new salon\""? Yes, that would have been. Instead you rudely reply with completely false information. No, my hair wasn't fried. And no, I did not give the ok for more than a trim. Also, I did call during business hours and did leave 2 messages. Your system needs fixing if you want more clients. Anyways, your rude response not only makes me never want to go back... but also to never ever refer anyone to you. You have proven not to be customer service orientated business."
0,"Jollibee, why'd you have to go and break my heart like that?\n\nI've always had a special place in my belly for this one of a kind Filipino fried chicken and fast food establishment, until yesterday. I haven't been here for a good 5 years...oh how much things have changed. \n\nFirst offense: an army of chicken fried in advance and sitting on heat racks. The chicken was soggy, slimy, very fatty and the crisp factor was out of the door. That's a fried chicken no no! Ugh\n\nSecond offense: 2 sausages in my sweet spaghetti. What happened to the promised \""meatiest, cheesiest, spaghettiest?\"" This used to be my favorite item on the menu too! Double ugh \n\nThird offense: that burger steak combo meal was so bad, I really couldn't figure out if they wanted it to taste like a boot or what! Triple ugh\n\nMy beloved quirky Filipino fried chicken chain went down the drain. Cutting corners is what looses customers! Ugh to the ugh!"
0,"Unimpressed is the best word to describe this place.  Normally a long line of people waiting is a sign of a good restaurant, here I think it is just a reflection of an inefficient operation.\n\nI had the blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon.  Very typical... Nothing special.  I would not rave about the place, or go out of my way to eat there... If it is convenient, it is ok... That's it.  I would rate it a notch below Cracker Barrel in terms of food quality, value and service."
0,"Since acquiring an RV my husband and I have been to 3 Camping Worlds. The one way out South on Las Vegas Blvd is the one we actually purchased our RV at. This Camping World is WAY out on Boulder Highway. The other one we've been to was in California.\n\nAll Camping World's are about the same. I believe most of them have places where they do work on RVs and of course the retail portion. Prices are steep for certain items. You are always going to see the normal price and the \""Good Sam\"" price. You must be a member to get that price. We are members.\n\nThis particular CW had some pretty poor customer service. My husband inquired with a young lady working the cash register how much wax/cleaning agent we would need to buy in order to wash our RV. She didn't know and asked another individual working there - who also, didn't know. In the end my husband ended up doing math in his head depending upon how big our RV is versus how many liquid ounces, etc. So, the employees were pretty much useless here.\n\nI didn't find the actual store to be bad. Everything was clean and they do have a lot of selection for different items. It's just that I would hope the staff would be a bit more educated on the products."
0,"Bad service, don't go here! They don't treat their customers equally, they choose who to give good service to."

1,"You either hate it or you love it.  I always tell my friends - you have to like to find that diamond in the rough.  When you do, it's worth it.  My Juicy purse was $49.97 and originally over $200.  I've gotten Kate Spade purse with a broken zipper for $29.97 and paid $7 to fix it.  Worth it to me.  You have to be in the mood to shop and be patient.   We make it an Annual Girls Weekend trip now.  Just be prepared - there isn't alot of organization and some things look like someone has walked across country in it."

1,Had a great time & the views were awesome. Go before 6:00 & save yourself some money & if you drink do the happy hour for an additional $5.00. Went on a Monday around 5:30 & had a short wait & did not need to buy drinks at the bar since we had happy hour tickets. We had 24 of us in the pod & our group of 4 was each able to get 4 drinks apiece in the 30 minute ride. 4 drinks for an additional $5 or a drink from the bar where prices started at $7.00 your choice.

0,"We came to Bratalian for Restaurant Week 2014 and were very excited, given the excellent reviews. Although some aspects of our experience were good, overall it was weak enough that I don't think we'll be back. \n\nService: We called at about 5:15 to make a reservation, but the line did that fax machine screechy sound. Okay, then! We'll take our chances! On the ride there (it's about 25 minutes away from us), we worried that the place would be packed because of Restaurant Week so we called. The hostess was very accommodating and cordial, promising us a table. When we arrived, however, our luck with service changed. We didn't have a single server. Our order was briskly taken by one waiter, the food was dropped by another, and our dessert order was taken and delivered by the manager. The place was pretty busy, but other tables seemed to have good service. We felt overlooked and kind of like nuisances! The biggest issue is that they added an 18% gratuity and then taxed it. This is not typical procedure for Restaurant Week and I resented not necessarily having the gratuity added (I guess), but being taxed on it - I think - is in bad form. \n\nFood: From the Restaurant Week menu, we had the meatballs and fried calimari and zuchinni to start. Then, for our entrees, we had the linguine clams and the salmon with a lemon-butter sauce. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and the ricotta cheesecake. I thought the food was fine. The fried calamari didn't have much seasoning and was overly greasy; the dipping sauce on the side was a simple, plain marinara. If the calimari is going to be so plain, at least offer something a bit zestier for dipping. The meatballs were below average. They are VERY large, but, again, there wasn't much flavor. They were also a bit dense and dry; we were hoping for plump, juicy meatballs. The entrees were much better. The clams in the linguine were big and so flavorful. My salmon was probably the best part. The skin was crispy, the fish was cooked perfectly, the lemon-butter was succulent, and the sauteed spinach was a lovely compliment. If I come back, I would get the same entree. I was really looking forward to dessert because of other reviews, but I gotta say, the ricotta cheesecake didn't live up to the hype. I thought it was too dense and bread-y. The flavor was fine, but I didn't finish it because of the density. It was like a having a mouthful of wet sand! The profiteroles that my boyfriend ordered were good. The pastry was flaky and what can go wrong with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce?We had a half carafe of red wine along with our food, which gave us about 3 glasses total. \n\nAtmosphere: It's a small restaurant, but it's very cute. It's decorated perfectly and arranged so that it's size is not a problem. It's lively - lots of groups. There were a few slip-ups that night: a tray of dishes crashed, the smoke alarm went off in the kitchen. No major issues, really. Just added to the fun. The biggest \""atmosphere\"" problem for me is the broken lock on the women's room door. I struggled to get out of that bathroom for like five minutes, which doesn't seem like a long time until that's the amount of minutes you spend involuntarily in a bathroom. I had almost resigned myself to my new life as a bathroom-dweller, about to start fashioning a bed out of toilet paper, when I finally escaped. Bratalian, you've got to fix the door. \n\nOverall, it was just okay. The service was unexceptional and simply got the job done. The food was fine. Unfortunately, that's not really enough to have me come back."
0,"Terrible service, waited 10 - 15 minutes for someone to show up at pharmacy and she was the most disgusting, nasty and inhospitable person I have ever encountered in my life.

1,"Having been a customer of Tower of Jewels for about 35 years or more I was Yelping and decided to take a look at what people say about the business.  I was shocked at the love/hate Yelps.  This business is probably the most reputable business of ANY kind in this city and owned and operated by its owner, Jack Weinstein....who takes the utmost pride in his and his employees work and customer service. He and his business are part of the history of our city.  Who's Who of past and present are his clientele but treats even small potatoes like me like we are special.  Through the years I can not even begin to tell you the wonderful things I know personally of that this man has done for people and the community.  And to those who say bad things about how they were treated....I think you might want to look in the mirror.  Usually people get treated like they treat others but in the case of Tower of Jewel employees that is not the case.  Mr Weinstein insists on and gets the best attitudes from his employees...they may not kiss your behind but you will get good, quality service no matter what demeanor you display.\n\nAs for the security guard....how great is that to have someone their to look after your safety while shopping for valuable items or bring them in for repairs.  \n\nAs for shopping center jewelers...I am not bad mouthing them.  They have their niche.  But for a quality, long term relationship with a jeweler....choose Tower of Jewels for your family and stick with them.  You will not be sorry.  It is not too late, start now.  Take your items in to be cleaned and checked....have a battery put in your watch...start small....I think you will be more that pleased that you did....tell them I told you to come in for that service....my name is Connie....they just Rodium plated a junk jewelry pendant my husband bought me a long time ago when we had no money for the real thing....it looks like million bucks!  And they treat us like a million bucks too."

1,"One weekend afternoon I looked at Mr. M and said, \""Hey!  Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly.\""  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.  \n\nSomeone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.\n\nI wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.  \n\nWe had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.   \n\nWith 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.  Really enjoyed the cold beers and the food and if we're in the area we'll definitely make another visit."
1,"Definitely still a big fan of Vivace. It definitely is (still) one of the best looking restaurants in town with a sweet patio and *stunning* upstairs lounge area. If you're seeking a private party space you must check out that second floor. \n\nService is spot on and are happy to not only describe the dishes, but they go above and beyond detailing the wines on special, where they come from, what the grapes are like, etc. The menu changes up on occasion and I had the pleasure of trying their new-ish chili capellini with crab. While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course. \n\nFor dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato. Vivace is still one of my faves in the QC. Grazie!"
0,They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.
0,"I used to like this place for one reason. Ice cream. But service here is so horrible now. I can't comment on the food since we were never seated. The \""hostess\"" was new and told us there were no tables available even though there were plenty of tables open. I asked why and she said those are all reserved for later...Hmm it was 6:45 and she said people had reservations for 6:30. That was the first issue. We've been here many times in the past, never with a reservation and this new hostess says they don't have a table for us. Then a server comes over and assures us we are not welcome there. Your job is to make customers feel welcomed, not kick them to the curb. Needless to say I will never come back. The only reason I've been going in the past was for their pistachio ice cream. All of the meat or chicken was always way too dry or undercooked. Rude service to say the least. They need to get rid of this horrible new staff and keep that help wanted sign on the window cause the staff they have now belongs at a walmart with their lack of hospitality. Go to Persian Room."
1,"Excellent. Staff, food, service, quality, freshness delish. Excellent prices."
0,My wife and I went out for dinner the Friday night 1-3-15 it was our second time toe Luke's both time the service was poor but on this night it ruined what was a great meal. Once we had been seated a server came took our drink orders for the woman who would be serving us another waiter brought us the drinks. our server came twice to get and app order and out dinner order then we did not see her until I was half way through the meal. She never offered to refill my water nor offer another glass of wine until my glass sat empty for half of my meal. It took ten minutes for her to cash out of check with the gift card we used and when she dropped of the check it came with no thank you or smile. My wife and I are sorry that we caused this server such heart ache by having to serve us food and drink. The food is good but this will keep us from coming back.
0,"The food here is horrible.  I went here for my bachelor's party with 2 of my close friends. We shared the ahi tuna tartare served with a cucumber yogurt (bland), crab salad (too much crab not enough acid/citrus or any other flavors for that matter), pate de campagne (so-so), braised short ribs (tender, but the sauce resembled that of A-1--so thick it looked like molasses), and the DB Burger (too large, impossible to eat like a regular burger, bland, and served with the soggiest 40 dollar frites ever.).  Definitely not going back."
0,"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL, UNORGANIZED AND NOT FRIENDLY. I went to this facility after I was in a car accident and received sub-par treatment. Additionally, after I ceased treatment, I was sent on a six month long nightmare battle with the billing department. I was sent to collections twice after personally paying bills, my med-pay satisfying bills, etc. I eventually had to physically go to the location and send a huge copy of bills/received payment, etc. to the collections agency. DO NOT TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN RISKING YOUR CREDIT AND SANITY."
1,I have never had a bad meal at Uncle Sal's. This is the type of italian place that has you unbuttoning your pants at the end of your meal AND taking left overs home! Great wine selection too!
1,"So you think you had a great long island???  Well try them here.  They are cheap and not drowned out.  This is a perfect place to pre game for a night out, although not a place to go if your trying to have a conversation with your buddies.  The music is loud that make it hard to hear your friends.  It could be worth staying if you come early enough to get a pool table, but if you come to late then you end up waiting at times more then an hour to play pool."
1,"I love this place for my shopping and their papaya salad. Although, everything they cook in that kitchen is pure magic. My family is from Cambodia and I was raised in Providence, RI while living in Connecticut. There was a heavy Southeast Asian influence in the part of Providence we often frequented. When we moved here about 8 years ago, it quickly vanished from my vision and my mother would go searching to no avail. Finally we found this wonderful gem and felt right at home with the food and the small family business appeal we were use to. I love being able to talk to the owner as i check out. They are nice and the food is authentic to the region. It reminds me of everything I grew up with."
1,"5 stars because it's 100% non-smoking!!!! MOST EXCELLENT!\n\nI hate Las Vegas, but love coming to golf.  Finding a place to stay where I can breathe is difficult...this little joint filled the bill.\n\nOk, it's odd that it's dog friendly, but I'd rather smell dog than smoke any day.\n\nRates are good, the rooms are spotless (we had one with the big jacuzzi tub - well worth the few extra dollars.)\n\nYes, the cable sucks - and even if we are in Vegas some of us do want excellent cable coverage, and this didn't have it....never could find NBC.\n\nThe cable is tough for sure; we found later at night and first thing it was fine...the place was 100% sold out and I can see why.\n\nHave fun!"
1,"The Manor Theatre is not only one of my favorite places in the Burgh but also one of my favorite movie theaters in general. Having recently had a face-lift for its 90th birthday, I was pleasantly surprised by the new renovations. My Dad was eager to visit because he could order a beer (and drink it too!) while we watched a movie; however, I was more eager to see the newest Wes Anderson flick which was only showing in one other theater in the city. Even with the Manor's new decor, it has maintained its city neighborhood ambiance. For example, there were university students and older couples all enjoying the latest foreign film from France.\n\nThe Manor has the reputation for being the \""art house\"" theater of the city and this is because it doesn't cater to the movies you'll find at your typical megaplex. With the exception of a few blockbusters and \""mainstream\"" releases (The Avengers for example), there is a fine selection of independent, arthouse, and foreign films that you won't find at AMC Loews. \n\nHowever, while I do appreciate the Manor's selection, this is Pittsburgh not New York City, so they're not going to have every film you want to see when you want to see it. Unfortunately, you may have to wait a couple of weeks or months to see the newest foreign flick, but at the same time, at least this theater gets these particular genres of film.\n\nOverall, I could not be happier with this theater. I'm so glad that Pittsburgh has the Manor. It's a great venue which every film lover should visit! \n\n*Also, matinee prices are great and seats are very comfortable too."
0,I used to love this store but it has really gone down hill the last 3 years. My last three visits to the archery counter keep getting worse and after Saturdays poor service I have had enough and won't be back.
0,"This store has gone south in its cleanliness in the produce department. I was there on September 14th 2012 and made a complaint regarding how disgusting I found this area to be. The bins where the produce is displayed are sticky to touch and leave a slimy residue on your fingers and hands. It is transferred to some of the items packaged so when picked up it is passed on to your hands. The glass display near the South end looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.\nThis makes me wonder what I might have missed in the meat and poultry department.\nI also complained about the lack of maintenance on the carts as the majority are a pain to push around with bumping wheels that make the carts pull to one side making it difficult to guide them in the direction you wish.\nLast of all I made complaints about the lack of air conditioning during the hottest days this last summer with temp as hight as 113 degrees outside the building. \nI guess Walmart is trying to maximize profits as usual. Considering how they cheat foreign labor, paying little for a ten hour day six days or more per week, making massive profits per item sold you can hardly believe.\nSo much for Americas number one international business, another Corporate Exploiter.\nI would have taken some pics but my phone is broken.\nI don't know if it would have done any good to call the Health Department seeing how powerful Walmart is in America.\nI am going back to Other super markets nearby, it's cheaper in the long run and healthier ."
0,"This place has awesome stuff, but terrible customer service.  I ordered products online only to receive an email 5 days later telling me that FOUR of my five items are on back order and that it would take up to THREE MONTHS for the items to come in.  When I called to see if they could send me the one item that they DID have in stock, the woman said she would have to charge me $10 for shipping even though shipping would have been free on my entire order if the items had all been in stock.  When I asked her to waive the fee since they are inconveniencing ME by not having four of my items, she said no.  I also suggested that they start marking items on their website as out of stock if necessary and she said they can't.  Wow, awesome way to treat your customers."
0,"I've been going to Cafe Rio for over 15 years. Since moving to Arizona from Cali we were pretty excited to be close to the  one on Baseline which is about 15-20 min from where we live but that made no difference because we loved Cafe Rio in the past. That location was average, always out of ice and always trying to rush you through the line. The food pretty good which kept us going back.\nWhen the San Tan location opened we were pretty excited because of its proximity. In the last year we've probably been 10-15 times to Baseline and this location 4 times. The other night we went and they were super chinsy on the meat we ordered 5 meals and each meal hardly had meat. Feels like Cafe Rio has gone down hill since franchising which is to be expected, but the prices continue to get higher. Get your act together Cafe Rio."
0,"I think this was probably the longest 65 minutes I've spent any any show.  Bite has moved to the Plaza and I had a free ticket last night so why not?  Well the long 65 minutes would be why not.\n\nThe show has been around for many years at the Stratosphere before moving to the Plaza so it's not jumping on the vampire movie craze that seems to have gripped the younger people.  \n\nI think the biggest problem is there really is no cohesive story and the show's writers don't know what kind of show they want other than topless (sometimes) female vampires doing different dances in different costumes in different amounts of dress/undress.  There are a couple of small magic tricks done by one of the male vampires and there were some strong man lifts and balances \u00e0 la Myst\u00e8re and the guys were OK.  But these disjointed segments of magic, dancing, strong man routines point out the unfocused nature of the show.  The showroom at the Plaza, which I think is a great classing Las Vegas room, is not designed for the types of things they used to do at the Strat.  There used to be some acrobatics done with silks, but that has to be dropped in this showroom.\n\nThe music was something else.  There was some 80s rock music and mixed in were two selections from opera that had almost no reason for being where they were.  Most of the music is recorded, but some was live and the singer was not too bad.\n\nAn acquaintance was seated at the same table as I was and his reaction was much the same as mine.  OK, I don't need to see this one again.  How this show continues to survive is completely beyond me.  The applause last night was not too great.  I have a feeling the show will soon bite the dust."
1,"We tried this place after remembering that this new sandwich shop had opened.  We are glad that a Vietnamese sandwich shop is now closer to home.  The other reviews said they had a long wait so I was expecting it,  but there was no wait at all.  Maybe 2 minutes at the most.  That was a pleasant surprise.  We were the only ones there also. \n\nI had the sliced pork sandwich. #7.  I liked the way the meat was seasoned.  The veggies tasted fresh.\n\nWife had the Mekong special.  #11. We tried each other's sandwich. She liked hers better and I like mine better.  The difference between us is I like to taste the meat in the sandwich I eat.  She is happy with tasting veggies. \n\nI would definitely come here again and recommend it."
0,"Hyde Park, What happened?! \n\nMy wife and daughter took me here today for my birthday and it was a absolutely horrible experience! The service was so so slow. We ordered our meals 10 minutes after we sat down and it took 40 minutes for me to get my shrimp cocktail appetizer. We had to ask for bread because we were so hungry from waiting. \n\nIt took another 30 minutes for me to get my lobster bisque that had no lobster in it what so ever, my wife to get her salad and my daughter to get her burger and fries. \n\nMy wife and I both ordered The Filet Mignon and Crab Cakes. The supposed Filet Mignon tasted like liver and my crab cakes were burnt and full of filler with little if any crab meat at all. We complained to the floor manager and she got the \""Guest Service Manager\"" Matthew S. He was very apologetic and took our meals, drinks and desserts off our bill. He only charged us for my shrimp cocktail and my daughter's cheeseburger. \n\nBefore today we went to Hyde Park four to five times a year. It's a shame because that dinner totally ruined my birthday. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever go back!"
1,"I went to all the big box stores as well as Lumber Liquidators before going to check out Floor and Decor which is a ways from me. I have nothing negative to say and happy to detail my experience. \n\nLooking for new flooring (laminate/wood flooring) after my house had a flood. I did like a few ones from Home Depot...but by the time I got back those items were sold out (online as well). Hard to believe but I guess I have great taste or something.\n\nDecided to check out the \""Walmart of flooring\"" and not disappointed. Sure the staff seems to be like at Walmart which means they are nearly invisible if you want them to be but I was able to get help fairly quickly and kindly as well. \n\nWhat gets them the four star review is that the wood flooring I wanted at their Tempe store was sold out (I bought all the remaining stock, about 20 boxes) but I needed twice that amount. The service counter told me their Tucson store had some and I was told to call because their payment processing system does not allow you to pay over the phone. That is why I give them 4 stars and not 5 because it would have avoided me having to call their 800 number to make an order only to be told to that that order would be from the Tucson store anyways. Confusing and something they should fix. One should be able to simple call any nearby store, prepay for the item and be able to pick it up. This wasn't the case with them. I was however very satisfied with their call center because the order was $100 or so above my daily credit card limit and I was unable to make the full payment when the shipping costs were added. They kindly removed enough shipping costs that I could conclude the transaction and not only that but the call center customer service rep recognized me and made the process very easy when it could have been a major headache.\nIf they can fix their current payment process, they deserve five stars and you can't beat the options and the fact that this place covers all your flooring needs."
0,Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.
1,"The Plaza Midwood branch is always a logical stop on the book buying excursions which I occasionally indulge in.  Located across from the Book Buyers, I never fail to find find nice, gently used library books for a mere .50 for a paperback or $1 for a hardback!  \n\nThis branch is always busy and super diverse; it house a Spanish and Vietnamese language collection.  Pretty rad for a small library.  The collection is small, but easily accessible.  The varied clientele makes for good people watching as well."
0,"Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either."
1,Love this casino resort off the strip! Facilities are topnotch! Even have a tv on the bathtub.
0,"I ordered from here because I had a flyer. I will NEVER order from here again. Pizza was bland and generic. Crust seemed like something frozen, sauce was non existent and cheese and toppings were lacking. No flavor. More like a flatbread. Zucchini was a very small portion and most pieces were hard and cold. Wings were shriveled up and soggy and lacking any good amount of meat. Fries were ok. Like crinkle cut you'd buy at the store. They gave me 1 ranch for everything. Also ordered a 2 liter of sprite which came warm. Food took over an hour to be delivered and delivery guy didn't seem to want to accept my money. Never again."
1,"The Pearl has been the home to annual AVN Awards for the past two years and its a welcome change from its previous home at the Mandalay Bay.  Most recently, I was in town and took the opportunity to see \""Pauly Shore's Vegas is my Oyster\"", which has its own review for those interested.\n\nThe venue is inside the trendy Palms Resort and hosts all types of events including concerts, comedy shows, and other entertainers in between.  Once passing through the theater entrance and security from the casino level, you take an odd journey down a few flight of stairs down to the theater.  Once you fin your section, you'll be amazed at how well designed the venue is.  The Maloof brothers spared no expense and made quite possibly the best venue I've seen for music and entertainment.  The theater is intimate, yet spacious, but welcoming all at the same time.\n\nThe seats are of generous size, but larger fellows will have to be a little cramped, as with everything.  I can't comment on floor seating, but I've heard its the typical folding chairs, which is a little cheap, in my opinion.  Nevertheless, once the show began, we were able to move around as it was nowhere near sold out and I realized there is absolutely no bad seat at the Pearl.  The bits of the show that played music sounded amazing and further proves how well designed the venue was made.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything it would be drink prices, $9 for a beer, but in all honesty, that's standard fare at all entertainment outings.  I've seen my fare share of venues in San Francisco and Los Angeles and the Pearl is top-notch and quite possible the best.  Kudos to the Palms Resort and the Maloof brothers."
0,Pretty disappointed. \nWe're from Detroit and came to visit PA. Wanted to save a few bucks on a meal so I bought a groupon for poppys. When we arrived they quickly asked us to leave because anyone under 18 was not allowed inside because they turned this place into a smoking bar. We had two kids with us. Would've been nice to know that BEFORE I bought the groupon deal. They def didn't post any of that info on their deal. So we left and went to Wendy's instead.  Thank goodness I was able to get a refund on my money.
1,The soups here are absolutely delicious! They make them from scratch in the back and they are better than homemade! The lobster bisque is my favorite so far but the mushroom is also delicious! The grilled paninis are really good too. I also tried a few of the salads. The lettuce is very fresh and the dressing are flavorful. They need a 'try 3' combo since its so hard to choose between two! This is my new favorite place. This is a great place to grab a quick bite before a movie.
1,"Love going there. My friends and I go there all the time for beer and wings. It's really fun to go and hang out and be apart of the atmosphere. It's a sports bar, so it's loud. But that's what a sports bar is! Duh! The servers are always very nice and seems as if they really enjoy their workplace and customers! My friend works there and can back me up on that. :) \n\nBeer is always good! And wings are never a disappointment!"
1,Super Authentic and Delicious food along with a chill and friendly staff. The Mojarra with Garlic had thicks chunks of pure white fish that  was perfect for making fish tacos. They even provided me with extra tortillas which appear to be handmade in the restauraunt. They were awesome. Got a free triple scoop of strawberry ice cream with toppings for checking in!
1,"My hubby and I have been coming here for years ever since we moved to this side of town, and it's always amazing, every single time we come! We love it because of the all you can eat for just $24.99 per person, and considering how much some sushi joints cost here in town, you definitely get your money's worth here. Their AYCE menu has a ton of choices, and even appetizers are included. My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while for the food to arrive, but they do a very good job at coming back to check and see if you like to order anything else. Highly recommended!!"
0,"I was excited to see the banner hanging on the back of their building space facing the freeway. I knew I have heard about Gimme Some Sugar first through Yelp and was happy to see a location on my side of town.\nOn a Monday morning about 10:00am my sister and I walked in. I was instantly disappointed to see just about nothing for sale. Not a good assortment of baked items at all.\nSo we were left to choose from chocolate chip cookies, monster cookies (oatmeal, peanut butter & M&M's), candy apples, chocolate marshmallows and Halloween Sugar cookies.\nNo cake pops and no cupcakes - BOO HOO.......\nThe lady behind the counter said they will be filling the cases soon but wasn't sure when so we weren't about to camp out until something fresh and exciting was brought out. \nWe chose Chocolate chip cookies &  Monster cookies. Both cookies were good - no complaints there - just wish there was more of a selection to choose from. The cookies were put in a cute black N white gift bag and stuffed with yellow tissue paper so the packaging was nice.\n\nI was expecting more of a bakery type of setting but instead it looked more like an office with a small corner for some goodies. So I guess it's more of a cake ordering type of buisness rather than an on site store.\n\nMaybe since they just opened this location not too long ago I should give them some time to settle in and give them a visit in a few months and see if anything has improved....."
1,I always stop in here when I'm in Vegas.  It's always busy regardless if I arrive at 11:00am or 10:00pm.  That's how I know it's good.  Ordered tacos al pastor & carne asada.  Best tacos in Vegas as far as I'm concerned.
0,Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!
0,"I was so disappointed , Bobby Flay should revisit this place , this food did not live up to the hype. Fries too salty, my medium burger\nWas more medium well . Too pricey for the \nLack of quality . Go down the block to Gordon Ramsey's ."
1,"still the best (and for me, the only) professional football team in the world..."
1,"What's up with all the bad reviews for this place? I adore this place...\n\nFirst off, they've remodeled and I must say it's rather lovely inside.  But more importantly, the food really is fantastic--well, if you ordered what I always get :)  \n\nI LOVE their starters.  The seared scallops (I have no idea if it's a regular item or seasonal one) are ridiculously good!  They are seared to perfection and burst with flavor.  I've also had their crabcakes, and they are divine. The portion is rather small, but the quality speaks for itself.  OH! AND THE LOBSTER BISQUE!!!  Best I've ever had...the soup itself was savory and loaded with lobster chunks.  To top it off, there's a wonderful pastry shell that tops the soup.  I'm telling you, get the Lobster bisque. You won't be disappointed.  \n\nTheir steaks are served a la carte, which get's a bit pricey.  But let it be known that these are HUGE cuts.  I had the ribeye done medium rare and it was delicious!  Perfectly seared on the outside, with a warm, red tender inside.  I couldn't be happier with it.  I don't care about the sides, as I'd rather not waste stomach space, but the garlic mashed potatoes were tasty.  \n\nNow, there is one matter that makes me tempted to knock this joint down a star---their desserts are absolutely atrocious!  I mean it! If you've read any of my other reviews, then you'll know that I'm a dessert fiend and I like my creme brulee....but boy is the creme brulee here total crap!  The dessert comes with three different types of creme brulee--choclate, traditional, and I don't even remember the third.  Man, it's gross. It's super dense and thick.  Stick a spoon down the middle, and it won't budge--it's that dense.  Aside from the rock hard texture, the taste is just off.  It's really terrible.  I can't image why they would serve such crap.  \n\nBut I'll be generous tonight and stick to the five stars.  But heed my advice--stay away from the desserts.  \n\nI do hope that they redesign their dessert menu and put some effort into it.  It's just depressing!\n\nOh, and as for the reviewer who was upset with the $150 kobe steak--I've been to plenty of places that don't list the price.  And they really don't tell you unless you ask.  Heck, I ordered swordfish at another establishment and was never quoted the price (it turned out to be a whopping $45).  Seriously...if you're going to order something that doesn't have the price listed to it, just assume it's gonna cost a truckload of money.  I do, and it serves me well. Or don't be afraid to ask.  I've seen the kobe on their menu, and the price is never listed.  In fact, I've seen this at many restaurants.  I personally, don't think that kobe is worth its price.  I'll take a ribeye or porterhouse anyday."
0,"We came to look at 3 different vehicles.  One being a car my husband announced he would never drive, much less buy.  Okay then, expect a much larger car payment dude.  The second vehicle was out of stock.  So we looked at the third.\n\nSalesman was supposedly a retired Jersey cop...gruff I guess you could say.  Tried to tell me I wouldn't want the vehicle they didn't have...uh, look out front, I'm driving one.  Pulled all the usual stops like asking me what kind of payment I was looking for, etc.  I especially liked that he lit a cigarette in front of us outside.\n\nBut my favorite part, worthy of an extra star was this:\n\nHim:  \""So what else are you looking at?\""\nMe:  \""a Volkswagen\""\nHim:  \""Oh God (grabs his face in his hands), why the hell would you want that?  Those people can't even fight a war.\"""
0,"I am all about the experience from start to finish and Fry's failed every step of the way. \n\nUpon entering I was lost and had a hard time finding the department I needed because the signage was so small. Plus there were hundreds of people you would think they were giving electronics away- NOT. I did not find their prices competitive on one thing at all! Also the staff seemed cold, bored and uneducated on what they are selling. When my guest and I asked questions the response we received was,\""Awwwww....\"" every time. My friend was making a large purchase and he wanted to be confident in making the right decision and the salesmen here didn't succeed in helping us one bit. \n\nOn top of it all I kept getting sidetracked by the aroma of Everything Bagels from the cafe in their store. Fry's really needs to work on motivating, and training their staff and also the prices and smelliness of the deli. We were interested in a $2,000 Plasma and I left wanting the $1 bagel....... Ponder that one Fry's."
1,Just had dinner last night here.  The Pinot Grigio just ok BUT THE FOOD was really good.  I would receomend this resturant to anyone.
1,"Four of us had a wonderful evening at Habib's.  It was our first visit. The restaurant is lovely, and prices are reasonable for this quality of restaurant (table linens, a good wine  list, appropriate stemware for quality wines, etc). This is not a jeans and t-shirt place. Understand that this is ethnic dining at its best, and the proprietor will be personally involved in your experience. He will visit your table often. He explains menu items and preparations in detail, so don't be afraid to ask.\n\nOthers have complimented  the oven bread that comes out first with a little bowl of shirazi (marinated chopped cucumber,tomato and onion ), but the eggplant appetizer (borani) was truly outstanding. My husband who, is more familiar with Persian cuisine, selected  a well-known dish after his eggplant, the  chelo kabab koobideh (ground beef filet, char broiled tomato and rice) plate, and he was very pleased. Yogurt on the side  completed the flavors of the dish. We asked Mr. Habib to describe the special meals he offers in addition to the shish kabob plates. These Persian specialties are not pictured on the menu supplement, but be sure to ask about them if you are interested in a dining adventure.  The chicken with bayberry pilaf was especially good. I was happy with my chicken in pomegranate and walnut sauce, a dark savory stew which is served over pilaf.   One of our party was unhappy with her choice and Mr. Habib quickly and graciously replaced it. He wanted us to be satisfied. We truly felt like a guest in his home. We kept a little tummy space for dessert to end a perfect meal, sharing  an order of baklava and a flan which the waiter torched table-side to caramelize the sugar crust.\nWe will be back."
0,"Beware Front Desk is a nightmare! I have stayed here on occasion and the rooms/service quality have been just average. But for the price it was worth it to me. After trying to book a room for a weekend then cancelling, the cancellation process has been horrendous! And I will never stay at this hotel again. I have never had such issues with incompetent hotel staff. Being placed on hold for 30 minutes at a time and everyone transferring my call back and forth. Save your time, energy, and sanity and stay somewhere else."
0,"Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible."
0,"The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though."
1,This place is sooooo yummy! I went for dinner and there was a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad. There's not much of a waiting area which sucks because it feels like you're always in the way. Once we were seated it was more of the same. The tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me. For that reason i had to remove one star. However everything else was superb! I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious. In fact I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it! I also had a Caramel apple martini which was delicious! I had to get another. By the end of the meal my belly was full and my body was tipsy. I'd say that's a perfect way to end the day! :-)
1,"Love this place good shave ice with tons of great flavors snickerdoodle, blueberry cheesecake the list goes on you can add blue bell ice cream for an additional cost \n\nmake sure you check in for a free upgrade in size"
0,This place is horrible. They lie to you and tell you that u win gifts or a trip and that u dont come out of pocket. I asked if it was a time share and they told me no. When I got there it was timeshare. And the gifts that they tey to give u that u dont come out of pocket u do pay for. They are liars and tricked us into  what turned out to be nothing they talked about!
1,"Love crepes! I've always eaten them as desserts with chocolate and banana nutella. I've been to Paris twice and make a point to eat them when I'm there, but these are pretty amazing! The lunch crepes are great, and you can even build your own. A lot of people complain about the price but I htink the ingredients are stellar and worth every penny. Not to mention, I love that you can see the kitchen, and the place is really cute and quaint. I definitely recommend at least trying it out!"
1,"Lisa gave me a great cut.  I am very fussy about my short hair.  At 60 years old I want a stylish haircut but not to look like I am trying to be 20.  Lisa found the perfect balance, a cute,fun cut, perfect for summer.  I've already scheduled another cut and highlights for later this summer."
0,"Ok, this place SUCKS!!!!! My bf and I went here the other day because we bought a voucher on groupon that was 2 for $20 rodizo lunch. This place is located in the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood, which to me is garbage. But, that's another story. We get there and sit down, the servers were not very attentive. They have a salad bar that was very minimal. The soups were no good. The cheese bread was hard. I guess the fried bananas were good, but that was it. There were only 4 types of meat that they offered. The top sirloin which was alright, chicken, some weirdass Chinese beef, and I can't even remember. The Chinese beef tasted like duck, seriously... WTF? Anyways, I wish I had saved that $20 and had just eaten subway or ordered a pizza. Was a waste of time, drive, and money.\n\nOk, maybe I'm a little bias because I LOVE Texas De Brazil, but still... I I'll never come here again, even if it was for free."
1,Very impressed with this hotel. First time here and I must say this place is incredible.
1,"Viva Chicken is a great place to get a quick and casual bite. If you haven't guess by the name, yes it's totally Americanized but they have done it in a clever and totally likable way. The food is flavorful and consistent. Try the Wow Lomito if you aren't gluten-free, counting calories, carbs or any other nonsense. If you want to take it a step further, get some yucca fries and bathe them in one of their signature sauces and then wash it down with some Maracuya (passion fruit) juice. If this doesn't add some passion in your life, you're hopeless."
1,"Went to a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised with Honey Salt.  The food was somewhat experimental but very,very good.  Not what I would expect to find 'off the strip' in Vegas.  Our lunch was punctuated with moments of really great food, but with one or two little things that were slightly off.  This is a five star kinda place and I think that I will need a reservation the next time I go.   I am looking forward to eating at Honey Salt again and seeing what else they have come up with."
1,"I have wanted to try this place forever. So this afternoon my daughter & I treated ourselves to the best lunch we have ever had. We shared, there was lots of food & we ate every bite! You could smell the mesquite on the burger and it was awesome. The entire family will go for dinner Christmas Eve!"
0,"Some holidays stay with you for the wrong reasons. \nLet's see:\n* The horrendous smoke in the casino\n* The extremely rude security guards \n* The people banging on the doors all hours\n* or the loud grinding air-con. \n\nGreat place to stay if you were at a conference or not wanting any sleep. \n\nThe pool and spa closes at 6pm. What's with that? \n\nThese are not trivial things. The fun and enjoyment of Vegas made up for the accommodation. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention the terrible hawkers who hassle you at every entrance. How many times do you news to say 'No'. I was thinking of getting a shirt made up. \n\nWe checked out of here and went to the Bellagio. Spend the extra for quality service. \n\nOne positive, the room staff tried hard to make our stay pleasant. We tipped them well but everything else was a shambles. \n\nStayed in five hotels on out trip all around this price range. This one was easily the worst. \n\nOh, no Wifi either. WTF!"
1,"Nice little coffee shop right here on Central. It has been here quite a while now.\nIt has everything you could want in a Coffee Shop. Great coffe, really good Tea. Nice things to eat. They even serve alclohol.\nWith the weather being so nice outside it is really nice to sit on Central and watch the cars go by. \nIf you have never been here it is nice to stop in every once and a while.\nNice place to pass some time!"
1,"I had the \""Shipwreck\"" burger.   This is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  My wife is an exceptional cook whose favorite food is hamburgers.   Though I may pay for it later, this is better than hers.  The combination of the brie, caramelized onions and white truffle aioli with the quality beef is wonderful.  The staff is awesome and fun.   They have a nice selection of beer and great music.    Check out the mural in the bathroom."
0,"Let's start out by saying I was really excited to try this restaurant. As we walked in, I was struck by the nice decorating and friendly staff. We ordered the meatball sampler, truffles beans and pancetta and a full sheet of pizza. The beans came out first and it was disappointing, not even a hint of truffles. Next we got the meatballs sampler. There was 6 different varieties.All with the exception of the vegetarian were dry. The accompanying sauces were watered down with the exception of the two marinaras. Finally we got the sheet pizza which was the only highlight of the night. Nice crust and sauce with the right amount of toppings. This place needs to reevaluate their quality standards or change their name from the meatball spot to the pizza spot."
1,Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!
1,"Best wine bar in Phoenix!! I stopped by after grabbing some BBQ and it is such a relaxing and cozy shop. We weren't sure what type of wine to get, so the owner stopped by to give us some recommendations. He introduced us to an awesome wine and we enjoyed it while listening to some live music. I think the best part of it all is how affordable it is. You can really enjoy some unique wines and have a great time with your friends!! Make sure to give it a try"
0,"Went with my wife and 1 yr old.  Odd that there was no hostess table.  Perhaps they were under staffed today, but it took a while to be greeted and order taken.\n\nLarge coffee cups were very nice.  Enjoyed the fresh coffee.  I also liked the decor.  \n\nTook forever for food to arrived.  It was very good, but portions are small.\n\nI don't plan on going back again."
1,"Great experience with these guys! Professional, quick and very affordable. I highly recommend you hire them if you need sprinkler help."
1,"Great access, 24 hours, service is excellent!!!"
1,"Well low key Chinese place, a little quiet, but the food is really good.  Great price, good size portions, and even though Chinese food uses alot of sauce, its not as greasy and oily as other Chinese places.  Wings are always crispy and hot, so are the salt and pepper shrimp, with crunchy heads!  Beef Lo Mein was good with plenty of beef, so was the huge portions of Mongolion beef.  Crispy noodle dishes were awesome.  Restaurant is clean and staff is very helpful and polite.  \n\nWhen I ordered take out last time, they cut little holes in the take out boxes so the fried wings and shrimp wouldn't get soggy from condensation, a really nice touch that was greatly appreciated.  \n\nMaybe it's because is relatively new, with an odd name, and quiet atmosphere and people don't know about it, but it is my new favorite Chinese food fix!"
1,"WARNING: This is a cheesy review from the greatest ABBA fan in the world. The greatest straight male ABBA fan in the world.\n\nThis show inspires me when I'm \""Under Attack\"". 2 shows a night for the cast, so they're \""Super Troupers\"". The show is pricey, it'll cost a lot of \""Money, Money, Money\"". But it's a fun show, great story, great acting, and you'll say, \""Thank You for the Music\"". If you see me at Mandalay Bay, \""Take a Chance on Me\"" and come along on a date with me to watch \""Mamma Mia\"".\n\nSo to all my little \""Honey Honey\""'s, \""I Have a Dream\"" that this show will stay at Mandalay Bay for a long time because if not, \""One of Us\"" will be very sad.

1,"Came here for the sunday champagne brunch.\n\ndecent variety of foods from chinese, salads, mexican, breakfast, seafood and even brazillian bbq style meats. I stuck to plenty of pork(bacon, sausage, polish sausage, italian sausage with peppers) and general tao's spicy beef along with other assorted yummies here and there. Only thing that sucks is you now have to pay extra for the all you can drink champagne extravaganza. \n\nAfter a night of drunken shenanigans, here we were getting drunk all over again for breakfast, good times. It's vegas, I think it's a written rule somewhere that this is supposed to happen...\n\nFrom here, off to circus circus blitzed..."
0,"OMG - I hate writing this review for I've heard so much about this place!  We've been meaning to check out this place since it opened especially since the Roosevelt had closed.  We had family visiting over the long Columbus Day holiday and needed a night out with just the two of us especially since it was my birthday!  We even left Grandpa at home to try this place by ourselves!  When we arrived we walked into a \""please seat yourself sign.\""  Hard to \""seat yourself\"" when the place is packed.  We finally was offered a table at the back per a group who graciously gave up their table for friends who were a no show.  This was a table with a perfect window view of behind the scenes of the keg taps.  We waited about 12 minutes or so before a \""waiter\"" felt bad for us to ask if we had ordered yet.  We asked for a drink menu only to be told we should have either looked at it on the way in or take a step outside to see it!  We told him what we wanted to drink and he said he would do the best to match our needs.  We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service.  We were forced to simply leave a $10 bill on the table for no one every came back to check on us and we promptly made our way to the door!!!!  I don't think we will be making our way back here anytime soon, we really should give this place a 1/2 star but we liked what they did with the place ;o)."
0,"I had the Dallas burger medium and my friend had the New Mexico medium rare. Who would have thought the medium would be pinker than medium rare. This place is supposed to be all about burgers but if it can't get the cooking temp right, then what's the point. I read another review that stated their server refilled their drinks for them. I had no such luck getting my iced tea refilled. Nota fan, won't come back."
1,"My family and I going to Qdoba. The staff is friendly and most importantly, my daughter loves the rice, chicken, cheese and peppers in her burrito bowl.\n\nThe food is always fresh and like the ability to pick and choose what fixings and toppings you can place on your taco or burrito.\n\nI know this may scorn some, buy I'll take Qdoba over Chipotle anyday!\n\nThe place is always clean and usually served quickly.\n\nThe chips with guac is a tasty addition to any meal.\n\nWe try and hit Qdoba once every few weeks and never disappoints!."

0,"9/2/14 - Others I have known have received spectacular bouquets from them, and so I decided to use them as well on two different occasions.  Both were funeral services, and both flowers were very disappointing.  The first was a $75 poinsettia for a holiday memorial, which didn't look as good as I could have bought in a grocery store.  The second was a funeral spray with yellow carnations and some huge sunflowers.  I don't like sunflowers at all, and don't think they belong in a funeral spray.  But I left it up to the florist to make the decision on which flowers to use.  Won't make that mistake again.\n\nUPDATE - 9/8/13 3.0 star rating 9/2/2014\nGot a very nice email from Dave, owner at English Garden Florist, who genuinely apologized and offered to make amends.  I appreciated his interest in my displeasure, and altho I have no near term need for flowers, he asked that I call him directly the next time I order.  With that kind of customer service, I will certainly give them another chance."
0,Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  \n\nTheir sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food.
0,I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.\n\n A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC.
1,"This is the fanciest library I've ever seen!  I haven't really been to many but compared to what this library used to look like before the expansion and compared to what I'm used to seeing back home, the Champaign Public Library is pretty cool.  \n\nMy favorite things about this library are:\n- Plenty of seating.  There are lots of open couches to sit on and read or tables to work on.  There are even quiet rooms if you need the extra silence.\n- The children's area.  I bring my son with me most of the time and he enjoys playing with the toys in there.  I'm still trying to get him interested in the actual books though.  They also have story time in a separate room there.  The rainbow lights of the librarian's desk also entertain my son.\n- The checkout area.  It's electronic and fully automated so that all you have to do is stick your library card in the slot, stack your books on the rubber pad, and get a receipt of what you checked out.  I've never seen anything like it.  What's comforting is that there are still some clerks at the checkout desk so that if you're like me and can't quite figure it out on your first try right there to help you.\n- The outside book return.  It's so simple and fun to watch (or maybe I'm just easily entertained...LOL!)  It's not right in front of the entrance, it's on the opposite side of the building, but that makes it easier to return your stuff because all you have to do is drive around to the other side.  You don't have to park or get out of your car.  You just drive up and hold your book up to the return slot and it opens automatically.  Then you just put your things on the conveyor belt and the slot closes and you're done.  Easy!"
1,"This is my hometown airport so it's hard to write a bad review (you know, local pride and all that). I fly in and out of McCarran a lot. It's a serviceable airport with fairly easy parking and decent services. It's an older airport so it shows its age, but since Vegas attracts tourists from all walks of life from all over the world, it's a great place to people watch between flights. My favorite is to watch when people get off a plane from, say, Newark, and then they head straight for the in-airport slot machines. Only in Vegas. The new Terminal 3 wing is super nice and shiny but lacks adequate seating (and the security lines can be ridiculously long). If you are traveling out of Terminal 3 you need to allow at least 30 more minutes than you think you need."
1,"Mercurio's is my go-to place in Pittsburgh for gelato. They frequently change their flavors which provides even more incentive for me to go back. When I went, I got a waffle cone with samoa and blue muffin gelato. The samoa gelato had every component of the samoa cookie and I could taste the shredded coconut. The blue muffin gelato tasted like a blueberry cheesecake which is my favorite type of cheesecake. There is absolute nothing wrong with their gelato and I will be going back as many times as possible."
0,"I've got to agree that the portions are huge and should be shared by 3 or more people.  If you have a refrigerator in your room for the left overs then go ahead and get one meal for yourself.\n\nWe actually ate there twice because we were staying at the Imperial Palace.  The first night we had the Sage Chicken and Waffles and the #5 burger that was stuffed with bacon and avocado.  The chicken was dry and the hamburger really didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered a beer off of the draft list and was told that they don't carry draft beers at the that location but they all of the restaurants use the same menu.  That seems kinda cheap to me.  I was really looking forward to a Mothership.\n\nThe next night my husband and I shared the Sage chicken Benedict.  This time the chicken wasn't dry and the hollandaise sauce was flavorful but the biscuit underneath was dry and hard.  Our girls got the tractor pancake breakfast and the pancake was HUGE!! One lady that was walking by said \""Look its the Uncle Buck pancake!!!!\""  The girls got a laugh out of it but when I tasted it I thought \""dry again.\""\n\nSo what I would recommend is that if its late and you are staying in the hotel it doesn't hurt to try it once but don't make a special trip just to eat there.  I was very disappointed."
1,"I'm not vegetarian or vegan myself, but I can definitely appreciate what a restaurant like Green can dish up to entice even the staunchest meat lover. In reality, everything on the menu looked amazing - fresh ingredients, inventive dishes, and always healthy. I decided to order the \""Moo-shroom BBQ Po-Boy\"" sandwich, which consisted of sliced portobello slathered in sweet and tasty barbeque sauce. It came with a side of house cole slaw made with a hint of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. Both were VERY good.\n\nGreen doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is an entirely different story. All of the walls are covered with really cool recycled art i.e. old, painted VW hubcaps, menus cut up and made to look like birds flying through plastic grocery bag clouds, etc. You really just have to see it. The bottom line is, you get a strong vibe of responsibility for what you put into your body as well as the greater environment. \n\nI'm looking forward to visiting Green again the next time I'm in the Tempe area."
0,"I was there on Friday night about 9:00.  Not very many people and it seems that this place is short staffed.  No hostess, and only 2 servers for this large place.  My server was very good - he gets high marks!  The food was another story.\n\nI ordered the lemon sole, a side salad and that's all.  With tax and tip the meal came to $20.00.  The salad was nice and fresh and crisp.  The lemon caper sauce was tasty, the sole was not very good.  I did mention this to the server and he offered to replace it, but I didn't want to wait.  It was supposed to be \""saut\u00e9ed\"", the chef does not know how to cook fish!  It was fried and was crispy and tough.  Sole is a tender fish and doesn't need much cooking.  I was very disappointed in this dish and would not recommend it.  \n\nAs always, Mimi's does have good bread, but the rest of the food is not so hot.  This was what I thought a rather expensive meal (well not a lot, but more than $5 or 10!) and way not worth it.  Go elsewhere!"
0,"I'm staying here now and am disappointed that we decided to do so.  Ok, so we got the free offer for 3 nights and needed to go to Vegas for a trade show.  We had offers from 2 other hotels, but thought old Vegas would be cool.  After checking in we tried to nap this afternoon to construction noises from the next room.  Unfortunately we tried to call the front desk and no one answered the lines endlessly.  Then, we tried to call the manager's office, no answer there for 15 minutes.  Of course, now we are unhappy.  So, we call Security, three times and they tell us they will check out the loud repair sounding noises, on a Sunday coming from the room next to us.  No call back.  When I called again, the Security employee told me to \""get over it\""!!!  Well, we marched down to the front desk and eventually had to pack up everything and we have been moved to another room.  \n\nThe hotel is old, that's ok, and it is undergoing some renovation, that's good.  But customer service is weak.\n\nLet's give them a chance to get better.  I hope they do."
1,"This place is special!  \n\nOkay, you have to know the password to get in.  The guy at the door doesn't remember what it is, but if you promise not to rat him out and talk about your interest in herbal medicine or massage therapy, you're probably good.  They're going to ask you if you're a cop, just keep saying no.  Six or seven times seems to do the trick.\n\nThe fish tacos are outstanding and, appropriately enough, baked (not fried).  Carne asada is very tasty.  Generous portions, cheap eats, humble digs, super-friendly proprietor, improbable number of teen employees behind the counter.  Non-wimpy salsa.  BYOB if you want to eat on the patio.  Funky little shack, man."

0,The food is Good that's all... \nThe place was not as busy for a Sunday Night Football night. \nOur Food took very long to be served at our table. I saw the food just there ready for over 10min. Some of the waitresses were just chatting standings around not doing much. \nOur food was taken to the bar for God knows what and we had to ask what was taking so long after 20min passed. \nMy fries where cold kinda cold. \nThe burger was still kind of warm. It was good. The wings are very good. \nBut I wouldn't go back to the place. \nI rather go to the one on Indianschool n 23rd st.\nJust the waitresses need to be more attentive with customers and aware of their tables. Not getting distracted..
0,Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri.
0,"Like a lot of other DTLV casinos, the Four Queens is small, old, and wreaks of smoke.  Nothing really at the 4 Queens that gets me going here.  However, I still have friends and family that love this place only because they've won her before.  If you see me here or check in here, it's usually because I'm here with out of towners.  \n\nFairly loose slots based on people I know.  Table games are okay with minimal limits. The bars are packed, but nothing worth bragging about.  \n\nI don't frequent the 4 Queens like I did back in the mid-90's.  But will stop by because I tend to use them for their parking."
0,"The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value."
1,"I used to tell people I don't eat sweets. Now I tell people I don't eat sweets except for cupcakes from Butter and Me.\n\nKelly's cupcakes are amazing. I have never tasted any icing that can compare to her butter cream. The cake has the perfect consistancy. \n\nI have tried cupcakes that have been recommended to me by friends and family members, and I have not been impressed. I have been consistantly wowed not only by Kelly's cupcakes, but also by her service.  Delivery is always as promised and on time, even on weekends!\n\nFollow her on twitter @butterandme"
1,Good yogurt! Very clean establishment and fair prices. The quality of the product is good. The flavor is great. Three of us ate there for just about $11 which isn't bad.
0,"So I went here a while ago with some family for dinner. The woman at the desk said it would be an20 minute wait but they had us seated within ten minutes. No problem. \n\nWe order our food and drinks and wait. And Wait... And wait.. And wait some more. When I checked my phone I noticed that we had been waiting for 40 minutes for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer the food would be and he said \""soon.\"" Twenty minutes later, we finally got our food.\n\nWe were so excited to get our food only to find that it was cold. The flavor was good, but when you're starving and wait about an hour for your food, you expect it to be up to standard. So the fact that it was cold kinda put us all in a bad mood. Especially when the people sitting next to us who just came in got their food before us! Really, annoying.\n\nSo the food was good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll have to wait a long time. The staff was polite and apologetic about the long wait. We even got a little free dessert because we waited so long. \n\nOverall, I'd probably come back because of the taste of the food. You should give this place a try if you're willing to wait."
0,"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."

1,"I want more of Casey Moore's, but the question is how much more?\n\nMy first experience with Casey's was a good one.  Keep in mind I went on a Wednesday night,  and it was mellow. I think this place could be rather obnoxious on a weekend, if it full of ASU students. I was fortunate to be hanging with some Grad students and couple post graduate people, all who were mature and chill. Reading some of the negative reviews (and talking to friends)  I get the impression a few meatheads, could really ruin this place for someone. \n\nThe decor, location, and sprawling layout makes this place very different from most Tempe Bars. It's hidden away on Ash st. and besides being right next to train tracks, it's very quiet. I like the fact it's old, weathered and nostalgic. CMs has a good variety of beer, and great prices (Stella for $3.50 Woohoo!) \n\nI think like any place who you meet up with, will enhance your experience. I had a chance to talk to some fellow Bostonians, as we chatted about Boston culture.  Throwing lines out like \""Get the Pitccha it's cheapa\""  or \""I'm foockin Caaacked.\""  My personal favorite topic of conversation, discussing the dreaded all white Red Sox hat turned backwards. Anyone from Boston knows not to mess with this guy. \n\nI suggest CMs, for drinking and conversation, and now having been there on a weekend, it's still  pretty chill, at least after Midnight, where we can let it all hang out."
1,"I absolutely love Razzy Fresh. They have a great selection of yogurt flavors, some of which rotate regularly. There are the traditional flavors (vanilla, chocolate), but also fruity flavors and indulgent flavors (e.g. cake batter). There are also non-fat options, if you swing that way.\n\nThe topping selection is also sure to please, with several different fruit options, as well as many sweet options. My personal favorite offering is the chocolate chip cookie dough (CCCD), which is the best CCCD I've had as an ice cream topping. Usually CCCD toppings suck because they are clearly made with crap to replace the eggs. Razzy Fresh's CCCD tastes just like it was sliced off of a cookie dough log. Mmmmmmm."
0,"I went to Honda West before purchasing my vehicle at Findlay Honda Henderson. Honda West's service was terrible. We scheduled an appointment to come in and discuss a possible purchase of a vehicle we saw on the internet. When we arrived, we had to meet with another salesman and he was completely unprepared and unfriendly. He did not offer to show us the vehicle. I am happy I did not purchase my vehicle here. If you are looking to make a purchase, go to Findlay Honda Henderson, They are absolutely fantastic."
1,"I'm really liking this place!!!! Clean, nice beds....great customer service! The girls that work here are always so nice and friendly. Bring your own tanning goggles, they don't offer them to use like some tanning salons do. But you can purchase them here. They run specials pretty regularly, so give them a call and see what kind of deal you can score."
0,"Disgusting, it started off with the lady working there smoking a cigarette right next to us as we tried to read the menu on the window outside, (and we were there first, she walked out as we were standing there) it was so bad we finally gave up and went inside to get away from the smell. That should of been the red flag to send us on our way. \n\nShe came in behind us and there was a younger guy working the register. He was just plain scary looking, looked totally cracked out and rubbed his nose as he stared at us. The woman took over the register and you could tell he was irritated and didn't want to be there. Neither one of them washed their hands before beginning to prepare the meal.\n\nIf it wasn't prepaid, I probably would have just left, in hindsight should have just asked for a refund. The food was bland, no taste, had to be smothered in tarter sauce to make it eatable. \n\nNever again."
0,"Not happy with them right now. Washer still making an awful noise and I hate it when mechanics and repairmen think we are dumb because we are women. \n\nDoes this washer sound like it is fixed to you? \nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=4888691213446\n\nThe repairman Greg said all it needed was a some lube.   Worked for about 3 loads and now it is worse than it was before. \n\nThankfully, under warranty still so not costing me anything for them to come back out but annoying as hell!"
0,"I really expected better! And I've HAD way better from Roy's in the past. The Ahi poki starter was fine, although spicy enough to drown out the side portion of Tobiko caviar, which was a shame. The Sunrise at Haleakala role - a delectable sounding roll of salmon, aji, hamachi, and asparagus, was a disappointment due poor \""tempura\"" frying of the whole roll. The batter was more like a fish fillet batter than a tempura, and too greasy. The overwhelming taste was fried batter, not fish. The scallops encrusted in foie gras were ok, but not the standouts for which I had hoped. The accompanying blackberry plum reduction was too fruity and sweet to complement the scallops. The dish included 5 giant scallops - I would have preferred fewer and better. \n\nService started out almost oppressively attentive and dwindled to virtually nothing (except water refills) by dessert. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up so we could ask for the check. The server was stumped by my question about if they have a chardonnay that is not oaky. He pointed out that one that was \""buttery but not oaky\""... hmmm, he needs a wine 101 lesson. And of course described the \""artesian\"" vanilla ice cream. Again hmmm...can't say I've ever seen vanilla ice cream spurting from the ground under pressure. A forgivable error, but another indicator that the it's no 'pro\"" service. \n\nThis food and service at a Bahama Breeze would get 3 stars, but at Roy's?? I really expected better."
1,"Typically I would stay at City Center but was hearing good things about this place so decided to try it out. I always like newer hotels. Well, because they are just \""new\"". For the price it's unbeatable. Room is nice. It's not small. I don't know why people post that these are small rooms. I'm in a premium. Paid 67 after resort fee. And stop complaining about the resort fees. ALL OF VEGAS CHARGES THIS!!!! It is true to its claim, smaller boutique hotel. You don't feel like your in vegas. Valet is great. Texting thing is awesome. Distance to room is simple and NOT FAR AWAY. I SWARE people who complain about the tower being far away. You're mental. Try navigating through Caesars, or MGM. It's as if you've never been to Vegas. This place is charming. The access to the street is awesome and the street is clean. Newer. I feel like I'm in downtown San Diego. Triple George Grill is just down the street. Not the typical $100 steak you see everywhere else in town. My filet was $26. I think that's fair. Half shower is not that bad. Come on!!! Water pressure is just ok. But seriously. You people complaining about the water going everywhere. You act as if this is your house as if YOURE going to clean it up. The water DOES NOT go everywhere unless you do jumping jacks in the shower. Give me a break. I sware I think people just want to hear themselves whine. And you DO NOT freeze because of the half wall. Yelpers can be so dramatic and kind of dumb. The only reason why I gave 4 is because of the music. You can hear it even at the top floor. This is a problem for this hotel. It's my belief that when I party I'm partying. But when I'm in my room, I want peace and quiet. Ask for the top floor. Away from street and it will be a good experience. And one last thing, I would never drink out of a coffee maker in a hotel room. Never. Not only does the coffee usually totally suck, imagine all the people using it. So once again, you posters complaining about that, carry your lazy butts downstairs and buy a cup of real coffee and suck it up because you are paying for it and remember you didn't spend the $200 per night rate at the Encore."
0,"Not wanting to complain but beware. Our soup was brought to the table lukewarm.\n\nOur orders were to have white or steamed rice with our meal it came instead with brown rice. \n\nWhen they brought the fried noodles and the sweet-and-sour sauce, the sauce was   Watered down.  Certainly much runnier then any sauce I've had any other Chinese restaurant.\n\nMy wife loves Chinese food and steamed rice and she found this place to be horrible."
1,I highly recommend the groomers who work here. workers and the owner are really caring. I've been a long time customer of this store because of their groomer and really great customer service.
1,"Everyone knows Enterprise cause of there fancy little \""We'll pick you up\"" campaign that has been running since the beginning of time.......I usually go with whoever is the cheapest.... however, next time I need to rent a car, I will be renting from this particular Enterprise..... all 4 employees that I came in contact with were friendly, knew their jobs and seemed to love the company...  The service was impressive for a rental car store....  they didnt hassle me on things I didnt want and really went above and beyond....   I feel 100% comfy with sending all yall yelpy yelpers on over there......"
0,"Here is your standard Vegas chain bar with the table top gambling and the generic beer on tap. \n\nThey play great music, have comfortable chairs and booths if the bar isn't your place and it's clean.\n\nA friend and I met there for a beer and my friend went to the bar and ordered. Instead of being given a choice of beer sizes they filled up the biggest glass they had and put it down before we could object. It would have been nice to have a choice, but not that big of a thing since we didn't mind. \n\nThere is also very little service if you don't sit at the bar. We got checked on once in the hour and a half we were there. I guess with that huge beer they figured we wouldn't need anything for awhile.\n\nThe really, really negative is that the bathrooms are total rest stop quality. They are filthy, (classy) people have written all over the walls, toilet paper and paper towels everywhere. It's just gross. I would highly recommend you avoid those if you go here. \n\nIt's not someplace I would go back to again, but I can see the appeal. I think."
0,"Waited a really long time to be seated for a mediocre birthday dinner. I ordered some sort of shrimp pasta plate.  Our meal was a long time coming after being seated. My shrimp had gone bad...really bad, so I ordered something meatless. The replacement dish took so long to arrive that I ended up eating part of my wife's  I only had a limited amount of time before an event I had to be at and couldn't wait any longer for my meal. My daughter didn't finish her plate & my wife was underwhelmed by hers (same thing I had).  It just tasted bland to me.\n\nThere are too many alternatives in this town to wait 40 minutes on \""meh\"" entrees that are not inexpensive! That's what makes the world go round though. Some people swear by this chain. Just not my thing."
1,"Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \""normal\"" Italian restaurant offers. \n\nI had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\n\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \""Holy Oil\"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \n\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\n\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\n\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\n\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!"
0,"So please tell me why this \""restaurant\"" stops selling food before 10PM when they are open until 2AM...."
1,"A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had, however, it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce, tomato, etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also, the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said, a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods."
1,"First time eating at this location....their service and food is consistent with any other location I've eaten at. \n\nWe sat at the bar, avoiding a 45 minute wait for a table, on a Saturday night at 5:30! They have call ahead seating, but we decided to stop in last minute.\n\nI like bar service myself, because there is someone there all the time, you never have to wait for a server to stop by.\n\nTheir infamous bread and cinnamon butter were gone in seconds....but a second helping would have been too much, because we ordered their crazy delicious fall of the bone ribs for an appetizer. Seriously, these ribs, no matter what, are hands down THE most delicious. I am not a fan of BBQ, but the sauce is toned down, smokey, not tangy.\n\nI ordered the 6oz sirloin, medium rare, with a side Caesar salad and baked potato. Steak was amazing! Quality and taste are out if this world. My husband had the country fried sirloin steak with gravy, house salad and green beans. I wasn't a fan of his entree because it was fried and had gravy, but he said it was delish. The green beans were cooked with bacon..I did not like at all, but he finished the whole thing!\n\nNo dessert for us, because in all reality, their dessert menu is boring, but after all that food, who wants dessert anyway.\n\nAtmosphere is super loud and the bar was a bit over the top with some heavy handed drinkers. I prefer the atmosphere at the Peoria location, but none the less, had a great time :)"
1,"After one pho lunch I wasn't sure if I was ready to give Saigon Bay five stars - that's a big deal people!\n\nMy \""regular\"" portion of pho was plenty and plenty delicious. I opted for P2- filet and the meat was sliced thin and came raw in my to-go package as to not over cook in the hot broth.\n\nThe to-go order was ready quickly and packaged well for transport. Saigon Bay is in front of Sushi 101 - in case you were turned around like I got.\n\nA bowl of love that will satisfy any pho craving- can't wait to try them again and truly rave."
1,"I have only been to Barro's for lunch, but I have always had a good meal.  I usually get a sausage & slice of the day (BBQ chicken) and they are both terrific.\n\nTwo slices of pizza & a soda for about $5 is a great deal. And the BBQ chicken pizza is excellent."
1,"Buddah chow mein for the win! So crunchy and yummy and the mushrooms on top are to die for; I could probably eat this dish every single day and not be tired of it. The sweet and sour scallops are also great as were the prawns nearly the size of my head. Service is efficient, friendly and they have the system down. The only sad part was that they were out of oysters that night and that's why I was told to go; cause no one does them like they do...so I will be back!"
1,"It's very rare to find Southern Comfort food that delivers I am so happy I found this place ! \n\nPretty much I ordered the 6 jumbo fried shrimp meal which came with 2 sides ( Mac and cheese And mashed potatoes and gravy ) And my mother got a cheese burger meal which came with 1 side also she got Coleslaw as her side .... The Shrimp were absolutely delicious and true to the name Jumbo lol I loved them the Mac and Cheese was to die for !!! ( I think we all have our different preferences on our fav Mac And Cheese lol ) this was great I loved the whole meal ... My mother LOVED the cheeseburger meal the hun was soft , buttery and flakey and she even woke up in the middle of the night to finish it lol ... \n\nI hope you all enjoy this place as much as we do ... We actually just got some more food delivered from them about 15 minutes ago lol but I had to take the time to share this deliciousness with you all gotta go now time to Dig in :)"
1,"A wee bit touristy, but a beautiful and elegant pub & restaurant steps away from a hostel on the Royal Mile. About a 7-10 min walk (downhill) from Edinburgh Castle. I saw a sign that said Voted 2013's best Fish n Chips and that was enough for me. Lots of people dining alone and working on laptops while having a pint. \n\nMy first taste of Scotland. Yummy! The chips were big and soft but also very chewy, no undercooked chips here. The fish was HUGE. I only got about 1/2 of it before giving up. Served on a bed of peas. \n\nI liked how we got a plethora of different sauces so my aunt and I could try a little of each. \n\nGood service too. I'm a fan of anyone who says \""Cheers!\"" to me. Yes, my American tourist roots are showing."
1,"Was taken here on a date for dinner.and the ambiance is beautiful. Since it was a nice night out, we chose to sit out on the patio (heat lamps are always a plus). I really wish they had lights on the course, so you had somewhat of a pretty view when eating dinner, im sure this would be a great place to have dinner during the sunset. \nI hate the corn chowder as an appetizer, and it was PHENOMENAL. Being that my date was a scottsdale resident, thats what he stated was the best on the menu. \nI also got one of their wraps, it was a crispy chicken wrap with honey mustard, bacon, lettuce and wrapped in a spinach wrap (if I'm remembering correctly) . \nI wasnt 100% satisfied with my meal, to be honest with you. \nThe chicken was a little dry, the bacon and cheddar were lacking, but the honey mustard sauce and the spinach wrap were great! \nI wish I would of tried the new menu that the server told me about. darn. \nbut if youre a golfer and you come by this course, i would check it out. Take the recommendations given by the servers though. \nThey know what they are talking about."
1,"I like the Sands properties since their shows are constantly rotating, bringing something new. The people who produced the Beijing Olympic ceremonies also produced Panda ! So the basic story is Long Long is on a journey to save his Peacock Princess from the Demon Vulture who kidnapped her on their wedding day. \n\nIt's got a little bit of everything: stunts like balancing on stilts, acrobatics, kung fu board breaking and sword work and traditional Chinese dances from the long sleeve dance to some fan dancing. I think the costuming was done very nicely and the stage was nicely used. The one thing is the whole back wall is used to project various landscapes and since there are steps and such in the back in certain angles the projection didn't look like it lined up right. The musical score I think was welldone and made sense with the story, though it would have been lovely to see more live music since Chinese culture has such awesome traditional drumming and unique instruments like the huqin Overall though it was lively and pretty show. \n\nThey try to interact and make it fun for the audience. Before the show you can find the pandas wandering around the lobby for pictures. During the show, they've thrown out various trinkets, pulled little kids to dance in the aisles with them, throw streamers onto some people, had big panda beach balls being thrown about during a staging transition. Between the theme, the bright staging and the audience interaction I would say this would be a good family friendly show choice. It seemed like there was a high number of children watching and seemed to really be enjoying themselves. \n\nNow I know that the main draw IS the panda characters, but I feel mixed about that. So the pandas are the only ones in full on fuzzy animal suits and other animals are more people with wardrobe that was made to interpret a animal. So there were moments where it's supposed to be sad or tense and I just couldn't muster up the feels for him since the panda was such a caricature of himself. He's supposed to be shaking in sadness and crying when he lost princess peccock, but his big head is just bobbing in a way that was funny and not helping the cause. In the picture I posted of the show, you'll see how it's a serious scene with everyone else on stage and then....there's a kawaii little panda in a suit and top hat. \n\nAnd of course, the story line sounds a little stolen from Kung Fu Panda. I absolutely loved Po, but the animation and the fact everyone else is animated made that more congruous. I'm sure it's a love/hate thing and some people may absolutely adore the fact it's a panda and part of the point is that it's fun/funny. \n\nOverall, I still enjoyed the show and appreciated the variety and a different culture it brings to the Vegas show lineup. Definitely if you are a parent, this would make a great family night. Or if you are a rice chaser, as I saw a lot of those there too."
0,"I'm so torn with this place. Between Cinebarre (the other movie/dinner business in Charlotte) and SMG, I prefer SMG mainly because the sound was a LOT better (nothing is worse than trying to hear the movie over someone chewing). Also the seats are so comfy and I actually like having a button to press for the server to come up. \n\nHowever, both times I've gone now, it's taken the server a ridiculous amount of time to respond to the button. So honestly, I don't really see it as much of a convenience as I would've liked.\n\nThe really bad thing is that both times I've gone, I've gotten pretty shoddy service. The servers are SUPER nice but I don't know if it's them or the kitchen but somewhere between me ordering and it getting to me, something goes wrong.\n\nThe first time I got my food wrong but it took forever to get a server so I just ate it and made sure my tab was done right. \n\nThe second time, our waitress read our order back to us THREE times (and that was at her suggestion, not ours.) Well, first, our food came super quick, but WELL before our drinks. I was halfway through my pizza before I had to stop eating and wait for something to drink. After about 10 minutes, we finally got our drinks. And they were wrong. But we were so thirsty and that had taken so long we just drank them anyway.\n\nLuckily these mistakes weren't terrible. I mean, the wrong food and the wrong drinks were still tasty. But...it's not what I ordered. And it was too difficult to get them justified.\n\nAlso, when they bring the check at the climax of each movie, that's a little more than distracting. I wouldn't mind sitting a little longer at the end in order to pay than have a movie possibly ruined.\n\nOverall, I think if they get all their serving/kitchen/bar kinks worked out, it'd be a preferable place for movies and dinner."
1,"We recently moved to Mesa,Arizona, and the home we bought needed flooring in one of the bedrooms.  We needed the flooring in ASAP, not knowing anyone who does this kind of work we turned to yelp, and read the reviews on Red Mountain Renovations.  It turned out that RMR lived up to their billing.  I contacted Scott, and after he heard what our situation was, he told us that he would be able to accommodate our needs.  The very next day Adam showed up and laid the flooring in a very professional manner.  We will be contacting Red Mountain Renovations for all our flooring needs.  Thank you Scott and Adam."
1,"This place is low priced. There was no resort fee, so the price on orbitz.com for my two night stay came out to $53.00 and change with tax.\n\nIt's not like many other places that entice you with the  low price in vegas, then in very fine print state a mandatory resort fee or internet fee must be paid upon arrival. (That is what happened during my last stay in vegas at one of the \""Station\"" resorts, my resort fee was more than the actual room cost!)\n\nThe place is laid out somewhat weird, the hotel rooms are located behind the parking garage in what looks like a run down housing project. Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside was about as clean and maintained as a more expensive place. The notepad next to the phone (which came complete with some else's math equations) indicate that it may be owned or operated by the same people as the stratosphere.\n\nIf you are in Vegas for work, and not fun, it is a convenient place to stay, as you don't have to walk a mile to get to your vehicle. If you have a work truck of some sort, you can probably park close enough to see it from your room.\n\nI booked the room with a single king bed, but was placed in a room with two full size beds....not a big deal for me...\n\n\n(edited review on 07-04-12, to change \""palace\"" to \""station\"" as I don't want anyone to think I was referring to Caesar's Palace. I also didn't want to mention the name of the other place, as this review is not about that place, but I guess I just did!)"

She is not there any more!dont know where to find her.she is the best of the best! I walked in there the day before! The vibe is so negative.nobody talk! I know almost every tech in there,I asked what wrong,they don't answer! Feel so bad for this place! The girl did my nails she is new and don't know what to do, it takes her so long to finish my gel! The gel if ugly because she did not clean it carefully as I had it before! My pedicure is ok but I expect more! I used to have the best massage and gel by Chloe though! So sad!"

1,"On Friday, December 10th, PhoenixBites.com had the honor of co-hosting an event with The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa.  Our media guests were treated to a muddling class, ceviche instruction and tasting as well as a delightful dinner and dessert.\n\ndeseo is located on the lobby level of the resort offering an enticing menu created by James Beard award winning Chef Douglas Rodriguez, regarded as the inventor of Nuevo Latino Cuisine.\n\nUpon arrival, we were escorted to the Muddle Bar.  The room is warm and dark, offering up a relaxing atmosphere largely due to the rich, warm wood.\n\nWe were presented with the Grande Mojito.\n\nOur instructor and mixologist, Monique Dias, was so enthusiastic and full of information regarding all facets of muddling.  It was not only an enjoyable experience, but an interesting history lesson of sorts.  Tasty too!\n\nWe were able to sample the Grande as well as the Berry Grande Mojitos.  While both were delicious and I rather enjoyed the introduction of fruit, I am partial to the original version.\n\nAfter our Muddling Course was complete we were lead to \""the rail\"".  The Rail overlooks the open kitchen.  I have to say, if given a choice of dining at a table in the main room or at The Rail, I would always choose the rail.  I couldn't imagine all the things you would be able to see on a busy night, not to mention the tips one could pick up just by being in the presence of these amazing chefs!  Chef Rodriguez treated us to an in-depth lesson in all things ceviche.  I was amazed at the amount of information that he knew and shared with us.  (I won't spill it all, since I really want you to check out deseo and The Rail and have your experience not be tainted by mine!)\n\nOur first indulgence was the Rainbow Ceviche, a beautifully presented dish featuring tuna, salmon and hamachi dressed with white soy, citrus, sesame seeds and pickled jalapeno.  In short - it was amazing and my hands-down favorite of the three ceviches of the night.  It was so fresh and light and the slight punch of the pickled jalapenos was unexpected yet welcomed.\n\nNext up we had the Lobster Escabeche which was a delicate ceviche served with avocado, chives, sweet aji and garlic chips.  This is not what you think of when you hear \""ceviche\"".  It was delicate yet rich.  Beautifully presented and a treat to my mouth!\n\nWe completed the trio with the Ceviche Mixto Clasico, full of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, crab, red onion and an accompaniment of sweet potato.  What a decadent way to round out the tasting.\n\nPrior to being served our entrees, Chef Rodriguez spread some holiday cheer by treating all of our guests to a personalized autographed copy of his most recent book, The Great Ceviche Book, revised. This book will provide you a bounty of information and instruction as well as hints and tips to create an array of ceviches!  This was such a wonderful treat to our guests and we were blown away by his generosity.\n\nAfter we calmed down from the excitement, is was time for our entrees.  We were served a split plate of tender beef tenderloin and merluza sea bass and fideo.  The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening.\n\nOverall - this event, having been our first to co-host - will be close to impossible to beat.  The staff was incredible.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere was lively, but not in a crazy Scottsdale Saturday night kind of way.  The food was impeccable and all the attention to detail and care in explanation made it a night worth repeating!"
1,Loved it! I'm a little late trying Smashburger but it was worth the wait. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger and it was delicious! I would say it rivaled my favorite burger from Bachi Burger. The other burger we had was the Avacado club and that wasn't as good but still tasty. The meat was juicy and everything was very fresh. \n\nThe smash fries were good just wish they gave us a little bit more. I am very pleased and want to go back and try their milkshakes!
0,"Would give them zero if I could.  Employees seem to happy to be miserable and treat customers like they are five year old.  Service is non-existent, place looks like a 70's basement with vintage TV and I refuse to use them again.\n\nThis seems to be the go to location for area car dealers when rentals are needed and i will not do it again.  I will ride my bike instead of using them."
0,"When I was finally able to go (they always close early), I was really looking forward to it, the service was very impersonal, I felt like they didn't wanted us there, maybe they wanted to close since it was already 9pm.     I saw one of the male servers continuously spank one of his female coworkers (what a chauvinistic stereotype, it's ok I can say that, I am Mexican).   The margaritas were good, the melted cheese was a bit weird it had a sweet taste to it, I got the spare ribs in green sauce, it was ok, it did come out pretty fast. I had better, go somewhere else, a place that stays open until at least 11."
0,"Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \n\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment."
1,"This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial."
0,"Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place."
0,"This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.\n\nI went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, \""Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge.\""  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.\n\nThat's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.\n\nThe soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\n\""Can I get a refill on the coffee?\""  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  \n\nCoffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. \n\nIn summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  \n\nCoffee?"
1,"A las Vegas gem!  This place has been here a long time, and has a lot of history to it. The reason it has withstand the test of time, in ever changing las Vegas can be summed up in this statement \""Its Just awesome.\"" The cheapest drinks anywhere $2 beers, $3-4 mixed drinks. And Get the hot dogs, you have not truly experienced this place until you have had one. The service here is great...smiling, friendly, and fast bar tenders. This is a locals bar, but they treat everyone here like a local. I always meet cool people here. This is a dive bar in its most purest form."
1,"My friends and I attempted to go to Spoon without a reservation and, as a result, there was a two-hour wait. As one of my friends said, I won't wait two hours for a table in Paris, why would I wait that long in Pittsburgh? With that said, we headed to Plum and, while we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, the bartender was pleasant and made us some great drinks. Once we were seated, we waited fifteen minutes before I had to seek out our waitress. Because of this, the manager treated each of us to a drink. We shared the tempura entree (which was REALLY good) and I had the pad Thai (which was not the best I have had, but certainly not the worst). The design, the bartender (Lauren?), and \""the customer is always right\"" attitude won me/us over. If you want to eat here on either a Friday or Saturday night, I HIGHLY recommend a reservation."
0,"I wasn't here very long, just long enough to half kill myself walking five miles, loaded down with carry ons, from my arrival gate to the departure gate.  Ugh.  If you're gonna make people walk halfway across the city for a connecting flight, at least provide some sort of shuttle or something.  NOT an airport I care to go through again."
0,"These bagels are an absolute joke. Not sure what part of the east Coast this shop is from, but it's not NY. Walking in, most of the bins were pretty empty at 10am, but these are fool's bagels. They are the size of a bottlecap and the hole in the middle is triple the size of any real NY bagel. Must be students buying these imposters because one look at these bagels was all I needed as I quickly escaped this \""bagel\"" shop and headed for the hills. Embarrasing to have east coast on the marquee - I'm glad it doesn't say NY bagels at least."
1,This place is great. The food is really good and spicy if you want. The drive up is really helpful as well. I do wish they gave more rice than one bowl but that's not too big of a deal.
0,"Is my bartender supposed to be drunker than I am?  I thought there were some rules about that.  This is the old Nick's Fat City building reskinned to look like a swanky deal.  It's really not a bad place for a show unless it is incredibly crowded.  If it is, you'll quickly learn what human sweat tastes like, and you'll forget what it was like to drink beer because you will never get back to the bar.  The last time we were there, I made it to the upstairs which was great, but since the bartender up there was seriously hammered, he didn't seem super interested in giving actual service.  The sound is good, the space isn't bad, and lord knows it's good to have concert venues in the area, but the bartenders kind of blow, and security was having trouble keeping up with the crowd."
1,"When I think of this salon, I think clean, friendly and overall great!  I have been seeing Sylvia (esthetician) for a couple of years.  She is fast, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.  I get my waxing done here and I recommend Sylvia to every one of my friends and family.  Call in advanced to get an appointment set and then they have a discount if you book for the next time in advanced.  There is a yelp check in deal for brazilian wax that is to die for... just sayin"
1,"Seriously surprised at the overall low-ish rating for this joint.\n\n Let me start by saying I am pregnant.  I am picky, hungry, and have something to say about just about everything (poor husband).\n\nHub and I decided at the very last second to try this place instead of KFC.  More options.  3PM on a Sunday is totally dead, and there is one server for the entire place, but seemingly handled well.  We chose to order our food to go.  \n12 Piece White Meat Broaster Chicken family meal\nMake your own 14\"" PIzza with chicken, spinach, and provolone. Half Cheese\n\nTook about 35 minutes for everything to come out, by then I was falling apart being so hungry.  One look at the pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it looked.  Eyes of pregnancy can be deceiving...however, not this time!!  Every bite of all this food was way more delicious than I was anticipating.  The broaster chicken is done to perfection; juicy, crispy, hot.  The pizza was nicely browned on top, with plenty of the toppings we requested.  Taste was phenom.\n\nI literally just finished eating and had to rave about how good this was.  Husband and I were equally impressed, and will return to try more goodies.  \n\nNot sure on service...girl taking orders was pleasant and got everything right."
1,"Finding indoor activities for toddlers is challenging in the heat of the AZ summer, but thanks to an invitation from my friend Jane B, I took my little one to check this place out this past weekend, and we had a blast!\n\nThe location is not the most convenient for me, but even considering the 30 minute drive, it was worth it to get an hour of solid playtime for sure... and of course, my son slept great after class too!\n\nI loved the casual and extremely clean environment at Gymboree, and I also loved that there was plenty of time when we arrived to get settled and play on our own before the official class began.  The structured class was great as we went from activity to activity including climbing, sliding, jumping, singing, pushing bouncing, and bubbles too!  I also like that they break down each class by age, so all of the kids in the class we attended were close in age and activity level.\n\nWe didn't join, but we do plan on dropping in for class again in the near future.  I also hear this is an excellent venue to host a party, so I'll keep that in mind for the future too.  Thanks Gymboree!"
1,"We're not all whales flown in from Japan on Gulfstreams... for us, $1 blackjack! The casino is pretty ghetto and all but you get free drinks to wager pennies at a time! I like this place when you want to kill time, waste a little money and get drunk."
1,Awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap.  Greta sushi as well. Never had a bad experience.
1,"I absolutely loved the work she did on my eyebrows. It was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded, I did not even know my eyebrows even could look so perfectly shaped! She made it a fast and pleasant experience! I will be going back for sure!"
1,"One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake."
0,"Review for the sportsbook specifically-\n6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars."
1,"Sam's, my go to store your snacks, awesome find s, and bulk items! The prices are pretty good. I get certain things and I get out, before I spend unnecessary money. That is very easy to do! Its kind of like a larger Walmart, and a foodies paradise! If you haven't been. GO NOW! ENJOY! \n\nOh, by the way, their pizza is delicious at the hot bar, up front, and they sell whole pizzas hot at the bar, and slices. In the  deli area in the back, they sell the same whole pizzas, except they are cold."
1,"We celebrated my friend's birthday at Bouchon.\n\nDown to what really matters, what we had..\n\nDRINKS:\nBouchon & Nirvana - both were okay. My friend wasn't too impressed with her Bouchon, but I liked my Nirvana. Tasty froth that reminds me of Orange Julius. I can't find their drink menu so I can't tell you the ingredients.\n\nFOOD:\nMACARONI AU GRATIN (6.50) - Superior macaroni. Baked just so the cheese is slightly crisp, the pasta perfect. I could've eaten that all night.\nHARICOTS VERTS (6.50) - Kids, eat your veggies. But these were overcooked, therefore, sat untouched for a while until I realised I needed to be eating greens.\nSTEAK FRITES (33.50) - Well seasoned, nicely cooked and perfectly paired with frites. And dang, those were some seriously addictive fries, but then again, I am a french fry addict.\nMOULES AU PISTOU (27.50) - Whoa. Talk about mussels. Tons and tons of them which were sweet and delicious. I love seafood drowning in white wine. And more pomme frites. God help me.\nCROQUE MADAME (18.95) - I thought it was tasty, but my friend thought it wasn't as good as other croque madames she's had. Again, more fries. Thank goodness our waiter talked us out of getting another side of them. Whew!\n\nDESSERTS:\nPROFITEROLES (9.50) - I thought the puffs were a bit hard, but they were fun to eat. I liked the ice cream a lot but I think it was more that it felt good in my mouth.\nBENEIGHTS (?) - These aren't on the menu but were a special for the night. Yummy. They reminded me of malasadas!\nPETITS FOURS SECS & FLAN (complimentary) - Because it was my friends birthday, Bouchon gave us a plate of petits fours secs and flan. We liked the petits fours a lot. Every single one had a fun texture and light taste. The flan was yummy. Not too heavy with a really smooth consistency.\n\nSERVICE: We were promptly seated as we arrived at our reservation time of 8:30pm. Our waiter (I forget his name) was attentive, knowledgeable and quick. He brought my friend and I navy blue linens instead of going with their house white, he explained the cheeses to us which we were going to have for dessert but ended up going with major sweets, and he didn't linger or not come around enough. Our water glasses were always filled, we didn't want for anything as far as service went.\n\nBouchon didn't disappoint I'm glad to say. I am looking forward to French Laundry, someday. . . ."
1,I've been looking for a decent mexican restaurant in Tempe. I drove by this place many times on my way to school. I really like mexican food and grew up around many mexican folks who were great cooks. So it's safe to say that I can be pretty picky. \n\nThe decor here is just kind of odd in a funny way. It's not necessarily bad it just strikes me as kind of funny. The food is great. I love the salsa here and find it spicy enough. I like to get their special called tres amigos. It's very filling and tasty.  The service has always been good and the food fresh. Overall a good find and pretty good food.
0,One star for the service but 5 stars for the dole whip. Extremely slow service! The server kept filling orders for people who came after us just because we bought the pineapple boat. Took 13 minutes to get our order. Sadly I won't be coming back. Id rather go back to Disneyland.
1,"This is the 3rd  version of the Springs Cafe that I know of, and its still about the same.  To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.\n\nThe dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area, the views of the valley are great. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day an just take it all it."
0,"worst food, got sick on the gross egg dish, there was also hair in the food.  Too noisy and cold, will not go here again.  Had guests and they were disappointed also."
1,"Nice!  At least I could find a seat! :)  Good coffee, nice to see their expansion into more locations.  Beans are good.  Iced coffee good. Internet good.  Music good.  People not super loud at this moment.  Good mix of people Han style (solo) and in groups.  Parking not a problem.  Stamp of approval!"
0,"This place is the worst,  they deserve NO STARS but Yelp wouldn't allow that. Terrible service,  bad food. DON'T GO!!!"
1,"This is your one-stop Chinese takeout shop!  Hunan park never disappoints, and they always have your order ready super quick.  I highly recommend the general tsao's chicken.  If you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own. Overall, solid across the board!"
1,"It looks like The Cupcakery http://www.yelp.com/biz/rOqY1Vj8sQ6kL9XLVQRslw?hrid=uAzjdVfA6_GBBfK2cuhwrA over in Henderson might have some competition in the world of fancy cupcakes!\n\nOpening up only a week and a half ago, word is that Cupcake Lane Bakery has a franchise in mind.  I spotted this little store as we whizzed past W. Flamingo Road and suggested, \""Make a right turn!\"" to my bf.  As we drove up, we noted the \""Closed\"" sign and knew a return visit was a must.  \n\nComing up with some cute names as \""Road to Hana\"" and \""Strawberry Fields Way\"", Cupcake Lane Bakery tantalizes your taste buds with their large selection of tasty morsels.  After reading through each and every description, my friend chose the \""Michigan Avenue\"", the bf chose the \""Lake Tahoe Boulevard\"" in honor of his hometown, and I went for the \""Hollywood Boulevard.\""  (I technically should have gone for the \""Lombard Street\"" or the \""Ghiradelli Square\"" in tribute to my hometown!)\n\nThe \""Michigan Avenue\"" is a \""lemon-infused cupcake topped with a zesty lemon cream cheese frosting and garnished with yellow and blue sprinkles.\""  My friend was impressed and knew she was in big trouble since this location was not too far from where she lived.  Not being a huge lemon fan myself, I was hesitant.  It was rather refreshing and light.  Sweet without being tart, and actually, pretty darn good.\n\nThe \""Lake Tahoe Boulevard\"" is described as \""Sitting around the campfire and enjoying our take on the S'more.  A chocolate cupcake with a marshmallow center, topped with chocolate ganache and crushed graham crackers and finished with a drizzle of chocolate.\""  It tasted like a brownie with a gooey center.  It was yummy, but not that special in my opinion.\n\nSticking with the basics, the \""Hollywood Boulevard\"" is \""a vanilla cupcake topped with vanilla buttercream and sprinkled with stars.\""  I felt this was the best way to truly taste the cupcake and the cream on its own.  The cupcake was moist, flavorful, and could stand alone.  The buttercream was sweet, not overly done, and not dependent on the cupcake to stand. I was impressed.  \n\nCupcake Lane Bakery has a lot of promise.  The interior decor could use some help and they have two solo couches and two small chairs for sitting.  They also offer monthly special cupcakes, like this month's was the \""Times Square\"" which had champagne in it.  At $2.25/each, or $23/dozen, they are definitely going to be fair competition.  I'll be back to try the \""Savannah Street\"" and the \""Park Avenue.\""\n\nSidenote: They even offer a Pupcake, a cupcake made specifically for your furry four-legged friend!"
0,No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food.
1,"Julian Serrano, where have you been all my life? Recently had a ladies weekend in Vegas and a friend made reservations at this amazing restaurant in the Aria. We were all starving after a day at the spa and begged the waiter to bring plates out as they were ready. They were bringing plates out in what felt like seconds. And everything was amazing, but the highlights for me were the coca vegetarian, the stuffed piquillo peppers, and the churros. (Good number of items for vegetarians, by the way.) My mouth is watering now. Back to Vegas. Must go back to Vegas."
1,"Amazing work, nice guy, quick service and an air conditioned garage while you wait. I highly recommend Dan."
1,"This mostly modern bar is full of warmth, from the wonderful, friendly staff, to the butcher-block tables, small bar tables, two person booths, etc.  The variety of furnishings avoids a stale look or feel, and there's plenty of space throughout to move around.  The decent-size menu serves a surprising variety (worldwide) of food.  For me, the burger was particularly excellent.  There's also a large selection of beers on tap and in bottles."
0,Even for free it stunk.
0,"We were excited to find a vegan Thai restaurant, so we decided to try it.  I can't say we were impressed.  Although vegan, it was not organic.  The food seemed to be uninspired and lacked flavor. Two redeeming qualities....the restaurant was very clean, and the staff was very friendly.  Our waitress took time to explain items on the menu and offer suggestions. We will not return."
1,"To start, this is my first Yelp review! So here it goes! \nThis is one of the best \""Dive Bars\"" I've experienced. Great Bartenders, very friendly and attentive! Good beer selection, they have Blue Moon & Kilt Lifter so I approve :). Regular drink prices are not that bad!!  They have HUGE portions of food that I ate way too much of....and also for a really decent price. We started with a 1/2 dozen sweet chili wings. Holy. Moly. Huge wings, and beyond delicious! Next: the burgers. Another Holy. Moly. moment. They had to be at least a 1/2 pounder! I ordered the California Dreamin' Burger with Swiss, Bacon, and Avocado: YUMM!! You can also get this with chicken instead of as a burger, but I just had to splurge! What made this burger even more worth purchasing is that I have the other half of it saved for another lunch or dinner :) The atmosphere is great. Lots and lots of TV's for those sports fans, but they also play non-sports shows too for people like me to be entertained by :) They even have individual TV's at each booth! It is a very clean and fun place to hangout with friends. \n5 stars in my book. Everything about this place was enjoyable!"
1,"fantastic!  what air travel should be. a quick day trip to the bay; ambient lighting--unique and cool.  service is actually caring and upscale. upperclass is great. all white leather, barber-style reclinables.  finally an airline for all others to learn from; a must for all air travel. love the ELEVATE program. now, if they only flew to aspen!"
1,"I like it. I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant. And they have a few things on the menu you don't see everywhere else, and its all delicious. I dream about their pumpkin curry!"
0,"Service is rough. Went there today around 1pm with a coworker and there were only 3 people in line but we were in there 30 min (and our order was to go!). I didn't get anything because they were out if chicken, from what I overheard they run out certain food items often. Anyways, no one greeted us. We stood in front of two people making tortillas for 5 min and they didn't even acknowledge us. I understand if this is your role but one could at least smile and greet us. \n\nWhen my coworker was trying to pay, a staff member opened the cash register to exchange their tip money and made us wait while they counted their tips before cashing us out.  Afterwards the cashier wrapped up my coworker's  food that had just been sitting there for a few min, meanwhile other staff continued to stand around and act like they hated their lives. They also kept asking my coworker \""is this your food?\"" When you basically only serve enchiladas its hard to tell the plates apart, you think they would pay attention to whose food is who's."
0,"Terrible! All of the reviews about the poor service were absolutely correct. We went on a Saturday for lunch and there were only a few tables in the restaurant and he appeared as though he was very busy. My mother and I were treated poorly. The server was short with us, had no personality and was not very helpful for this being my first time. The food was below par, the only good thing about it was the free basket if bread that is served with each meal. We had to go inside to get our check because our server was at the bar playing with his phone and talking to a girl. Definitely will not go back!"
0,"It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer."
1,"I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \""Subway Effect\"" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good."
1,"Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what."
0,"Dude something has happened to this place in recent months, the quality is not what it used to be, the service is not what it used to.  I don't know if they had a change in management or what cause me and my wife used to go here ALL the time for the All You Can Drink Saki and Beer and All You Can Eat.  We don't go here anymore cause the qualify just went and crapped out on us.  Go to Sushi Bomb down the street"
0,Couldn't even get through to make a reservation. A brief hold is not 6+ minutes. Not getting my business.
0,"Sometimes you can get great core service, but some ancillary thing can leave such a bad taste in your mouth you just don't ever want to go back.\n\nI went into Mirabelle's this morning for a big ol cup of coffee and a lil snacky. I was greeted by a pleasant girl and purchased a delish pastry. They don't have large coffees (and their French Roast is FAR inferior to other places in town). Total on the pastry and not large coffee: $4.25. About a dollar more than I would have liked, but not out of this world expensive. Straight out of low cash, I whip out the card and she drops the bomb: $5 minimum on credit card purchases.\n\nI recognize I am being a bit melodramatic by freaking out about this, but tactics like these by retailers are in violation of their agreements with the credit card companies and they really piss me off. Consumers are third party beneficiaries of these contracts: we pay (in more ways than one) for our credit cards and all the good stuff that comes with them. I fully understand why retailers do this, as credit card companies charge a percentage on all transactions, with minimum charges on smaller purchases. The minimum charges are more significant on small-dollar transactions. I get that. Stores don't have to play the minimum purchase amount game, though. The have other options, such as offering a discount for cash transactions or not accepting cards at all. They also can empower their clerks to waive the limit if the customer balks.\n\nSo, the net result? You already know this chubby bastard ordered another pastry. It was also tasty. However, I ended up spending almost $7 all told when all I wanted was a (larger and better) cup of coffee and a lil snacky."
1,"I love this place! The staff is amazing and the classes are fun and challenging. I've been hooked since the first class I took. The teachers are really helpful and knowledgeable, whether you are taking a ballet or  fitness class. I like the variety of classes and that every teacher has their own style they add to each class. So no matter what class I am taking its different every time. I definitely see a positive change in my body, balance, and flexibility. \n\nI was able to rekindle my love of dance after joining this studio. I hadn't danced in 13 years and was really missing it, but unable to find an adult only studio to attend. So with Ballet Fusion Fitness I am getting the best of both worlds that I enjoy...dance and fitness. Its well worth the money and I couldn't be happier."
1,"I love this resort and this bar is no exception!  Beautiful decor, great service and excellent drink selections!"
0,I was at Five50 last week and there was a friendly little green worm crawling across my friend's salad plate....when the attractive Latina manager finally arrived at our table she mumbled something about organic and deal with it....but not in that order....for an incredibly humble white boy like myself that answer would be more than acceptable...my friend is an attractive African American woman- who is not only a well paid executive in LA- but has not yet gotten to the point where the green worm thing is part of her cultural cuisine ...I don't think their exchange did anything to improve interracial relations....if only the environ of thirty dollar pizza's could be a little more post racial think how great the world would be....( in truth the whole incident might not have happened if it hadn't taken 45 minutes to get us two pizza's in a half full restaurant....the little green fellow might have just crawled away....)...\n\nHey Shawn your servers at Sage are a tad smarmy as well...I know you are from Chicago but you and your team need to tone it down a notch or two...
0,"If we would go back a year I would give at least a 4 star but something has happened her the last 2 trips. All waitresses have left and we think there is a new cook. \nDo not waste your time ordering General Tao, its nothing but batter. Thier dumplings which used to be amazing were totally awful. WTF happened??? They did not even have thier trademark Eggplant dish anymore.  Only dish which was half decent was the xinjiang lamb dish. \nWhen it comes to chinese food in Montreal it sucks. I spend 3 months a year in china and Montreal is just awful. Its more worth it to fly to Toronto for real authentic Chinese food. \nBefore I used to highly recommend this place but now say stay away!!! I will not be going back here anymore."
0,"We were regular denizens of Carefree Station and were unhappy when it closed up at Spanish Village.  We watched carefully when Scottsdale Station opened  T-giving weekend and figured we'd give it some time to \""find it's legs\"".  It's not fair to judge a restaurant when it's just opened and working out the kinks.  I figured six weeks is enough.\n\nExperience: well, you remember how you finally get a date with your biggest crush of all times and then it falls flat because he eats like a pig and talked non-stop about himself and his Mom?  Yeah.\n\nAmbiance:  Hasn't the charm and coziness and quirkiness of Carefree Station, but it's a beautiful place.  It's just very Scottsdale---kind of urban and elegant and poised.  Although I do wonder how they are going to keep those neat little chain-draped chandeliers from collecting copious amounts of dust as time goes by.  At least they aren't really over any tables.  Speaking of which, the tables are nicely arranged so that you do enjoy some privacy and you can talk to your dining companions.\n\nMenu: My heart thrilled!  It was--as best I recall---the old CS menu!  All my faves were on it!  \n\nService: we'll discuss that later.\n\nSo DH and I order glasses of wine and immediately requested our beloved sushi nachos at the same time.  We LOVE the sushi nachos!  \n\nWe ordered the roasted beet salad and the spinach salad (btw---Pt Reyes blue cheese is exceptional!) and then DH and I decided to try items we had never had before----usually he gets the Steak Diablo and I love the Shrimp Habanero---so he ordered the Pollo Fundido and I ordered the Korean Shortribs.\n\nFirst of all---the Quality of Food was Excellent as ever.  DH's Pollo Fundido was fabuloso!  OMG, if I were ever to return, I would consider ordering that dish for sure!  Tender chicken, incredible pastry, delicious sauce.  Wow!  DH would only share one bite!\n\nMy Korean Shortribs.  Hmmm.  Well, what came out was on a bed of something tasty and pureed---it was not the miso-mashed potato eggroll the menu promised and there was the merest WHISPER of Asian flavor.  The Asian veggie mix was good.  But it wasn't what I expected---which was a rich mahogany glaze with a bit of sweet and a touch of spice---not necessarily heat.  And you would have to invite me into the kitchen and let me observe the dish being made, because I do NOT believe those were shortribs---at least nothing like any I had.  Basically, it tasted and looked like Yankee pot roast.  A really GOOD pot roast, but pot roast.  I know, because I make pot roast maybe once a month.  This was a hunk of chuck, imho, not shortribs.  But it was good!  But not what I expected or wanted.  Should have stuck with the Shrimp or the Whole Enchilada or the Steak Tampaquena.\n\nI took a couple of bites and then we flagged down our server (Tammy) and I asked her if this was the right dish and she said it was.  She said they were out of the miso-mashed potato eggroll because they make them fresh every morning and they had run out so they subbed..  Ummm....we sat down to dinner at 6 pm when the restaurant was half full----sounds unlikely to me.  Plus, shouldn't you tell the diner when making a substitution?\n\nWe never got our sushi nachos.  We realized it wasn't happening when our salads came out.  No nachos.  Then the entrees.  But they were on the bill.  So we told her and she said almost accusingly: well, why didn't you say so?  1) It's not our job to manage the tables; 2) pet peeve: the serving of food out of order and not properly paced.  Also, Tammy, you never came back to the table unless DH waved you down, like when we asked about my dish or he wanted a 2nd glass of wine.  When she brought our bill, she blamed the kitchen and the runners.  Actually, everything that went wrong with the service was someone else's fault, never her's.   I can overlook having too many tables to properly serve, or incompetence, but I have an issue with not being accountable.  Anyhow, I think DH was aggravated enough with her performance he didn't leave her a tip or a very small one---I didn't ask.  He doesn't verbalize like I do---he notes his unhappiness financially.\n\nWe got out to the car and we were laughing: OMg---what just happened?  \n\nMaybe they are still working things out---I don't know.  I saw Robert and Linda working their tails off, as usual---but sadly, it comes down to it's only good as the people they have working for them.  And there are a lot of restaurants in Scottsdale...  I keep saying I am looking for a place we could love like Carefree Station---I don't think Scottsdale Station is it!  Not a great experience."
0,Came here again after my last review and we had to get gas for our rental van and so I pulled up to a pump and I went inside and said the the same lady I seen last time if I could get $120 on pump 2 regular and she said its ready and if u need change or/and receipt come back inside and so I went back outside and put the nozzle into my tank and lifted the nozzle holder on the pump and I talked to my family while getting gas in the car and after the pump clicked off at $100.10 i went back Inside for my change and the lady gave my my change and receipt and I ask her if there car wash was ever going to reopen an the lady said yes it's going to reopen in a month and we are going to have new gas pumps and another gas island and I said ok and thank you. \n\n\nThis place is now improving. My last review was on this place and I said to stay away. But I will give this place 2 more times.
1,"I checked out out Sophia's based on the rave reviews I read on Yelp and was not dissapointed! The food was fabulous and I personally enjoyed the atmosphere.\nIf you're not a people person you might not enjoy Sophia's as much though as a lot of people pack into their small dining area and most of the time you have to share a table with other patrons.\nAlso, keep in mind that they take cash only!\n\nThe food is great though and it's a perfect saturday morning breakfast stop!"
1,"Yes indeed! This is by far the most authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted in the US. Born in  Chicago but raised in Mexico, this is why my taste buds are very familiar with Mexican cuisine. I ate the Mole Verde and it was fantastic. Besides the great food and margaritas, the place is just amazingly stunning! They have this gorgeous art work that is a wooden piece of Mexico history... I cant find words to explain so please feel free to check the youtube link below you will not have regrets it!  \n\n http://youtu.be/of2E6GAXStg"
0,"I'm not a big fan of this particular location.  Just as a background, I've been a Chase customer and have 2 active accounts with them.  I went in trying to cash a larger check and the new accounts specialist was just down my back trying to convince me to open another account.  I nearly felt forced to give my number, so I gave it to him quickly in hopes he wouldn't hear one of the numbers.  Apparently, it wasn't quick enough because he literally called me for 2 weeks straight and left me a voice mail to come back in and open that new account.  Also, while at the teller... I asked about a sign I saw on the window at the front.  It was some feature where you can scan your check and deposit it via phone.  I asked the teller if this was something that was available for the Blackberry.  Instead of knowing the answer, the teller had to search for the answer.  I guess that's good that she didn't just BS me with an answer, but at the same time; I feel as if that is something that she should have known.  My last complaint:  After the first set of doors is a room where there is 1 atm.  Under the atm... an overflowing plastic trash can that looks as if it has been neglected to days.  Not a good first impression, especially to those who are non Chase customers that are considering opening a new account."
1,"I've never heard about this place until I had to go here for class. I ended up loving it out here, it's very peaceful and you get to escape from the city. There are a bunch of areas to go and venture off to or you can sit on the benches and watch the ducks and geese or you can even go fishing. It's a great place to even jog or walk your dog! I wish it was closer to where I live, but I will definitely be back."
1,"Love me some funk fitness. The crew here is awesome. The owners are trainers and involved every step of the way. This is a great boutique - style training gym. Lots of cross fit built into the workouts. They do one on one training as well as small groups. High energy, friendly, and all workouts are individualized. I've not found anything like this in the E. Valley. They incorporate all sorts of different styles of workout - including getting you outside."
1,"As a former sushi chef & business owner, I would say that Zushi Bistro is well on it's way to earning the respect and favor of the people of Mesa.  Being only 9 months old Zushi Bistro has already acquired a fantastic staff filled with individuals of great talent & potential.  \n\nLike any new endeavor there are a few things that can naturally use improvement.  And I believe the people at Zushi Bistro can make that happen.  \n\nThe sushi is good.  The atmosphere is special.  And the staff cares.\nZushi Bistro in it's infancy has already achieved some wonderful and unique things.  Such as;  a spacious & relaxed patio area, a bar that inspires charm & beauty, and a sushi bar fit for the most avid sushi fan.\n\nIf you expect absolute perfection out of a brand new establishment, this may not be the place for you.  Zushi Bistro in all it's potential is young and pulsating with possibilities.  This is truly a place for the creative and open thinker.  Where there's still room for the Good People of Mesa to make Zushi Bistro THEIR place to hang out and have a good time.\n\nI know when I go to Zushi Bistro I can leave all pretension at the door and still enjoy an evening of quality dining. \n\n- Matt DeLeon\nSinger/Entrepreneur\n480-621-7737"
1,"Great Pizza and Pitas, these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month. Fresh ingredients, lots of cheese, cant go wrong. If you are showing up around lunch 11:30-12:30, it will be busy."
1,"GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for \""cheros\"" aka\nguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Not\nreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,\nreggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18\nand over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. \nNOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind of\nplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot more\neye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle its\nmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impress\nanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.\nBathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about the\nbathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  \nPrices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if your\nhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!"
0,"We ordered to go, and the food was not great. We will not eat here again.\n We ordered the red curry chicken. It was watered down like soup, and other than the hot chile, there wasn't much flavor in it.  We ordered the chicken satay. My 6 year old said,\"" How am I supposed to eat this, it is so hard?\"" It was so hard and dry she couldn't even bite into it. We ordered the ginger chicken- again watery broth and you couldn't even taste the ginger."
1,"Divine!  That really sums it up.  Have the hanger steak.  It is simple perfection and honestly enough for two.  Tender, with the juices perfectly sealed in.  I dream of my next visit to Vegas and another amazing meal here."
1,"Mister Steer is a Montreal institution. Once voted to have the best burgers in Montreal . The interior has a dated 70's diner feel to it. \n\nOnce you are seated - be prepared to get a green salad. There's no way to say no to it. The waitress will serve it to you immediately (I see the salad as a good introduction to the grease that's about to come...) and you have only 1 choice of dressing: French (never asked if you can have ranch..)\n\nMr. Steer is known for their ball burgers. What I mean by this is that the meat is not shaped into a flat patty - but rather a ball. It cooks nice and evenly on the outside. The only way to order a burger here is medium - anything else and you are loosing out on the flavour. \n\nAnother great item here are the Suzie Q fries. These are curly fries that you can get with your burger. The fries are a hit or miss. Sometimes they are served nice and crispy, other times they are warm and taste like they have been waiting for my burger under a hot-lamp. \n\nIf you are visiting - make a point to stop off here. It's a downtown landmark. If you are a local and have never been, what's stopping you?"
0,"Called to make an appointment and told the receptionist exactly what was happening.  She said they can help me and I made the appointment.  I got there at 1:10ish for a 1:20 appointment.  They didn't call me back until 2. Then when they finally did, the PA told me that they don't do what I'm there for. I explained that I told the receptionist why I'm there and her response was \""The girl you spoke to is new and she was kinda left a lot for a week to fend for herself\""......really?  I needed this test done and now I have to go somewhere for it. If you go here, make sure you are clear about what you need and maybe call back to make sure they do it. I gave up some much needed sleep for this appointment."
1,"Let me first start out with my gripe and get it off my chest so I can move on with my life (just kidding, kinda). So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they \""were working on it\"". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us \""did your waitress tell you what happened\"" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with \""your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside\"". Little late now. Also, I had a restaurant.com voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant. \n\nThe food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together. \n\nI enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again."
0,"This restaurant was my third stop on my Gordon Ramsay tour (Steak, Burgr, Pub).\n\nKind of a disappointment. The beer, wine, and overall drink selection was nothing special. Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.\n\nService was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.\n\nI had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.\n\nThe scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.\n\nThe scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.\n\nThe sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this place. You can get similar or better food at a plethora of other restaurants, for a fraction of the price. If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be appalled at how this restaurant is executing."
1,"The Mecklenburg ABC store here is decent.\n\nSelections - They have all your spirits and liquids that you need.  They don't have my favorite cognac here, but that is okay. \n\nService - nice. I know you were eyeing at me, because of my age!! But rest assured, I am beyond old enough to drink. I will take that as a compliment.\n\nPrice - as any other ABC stores, just a tad bit pricier than I am used to. Just a 'tad' bit."
1,I loved the atmosphere and food.. Yummy..
0,The quality of sushi was excellent.  That was the only good thing about this place.  There is no reason on this earth that it should take over 45 min to get 2 rolls and I nigiri.   Terrible service.  Nearly walked out.  Also a bit noisy.
1,"This time I enjoyed my experience even more than last!  Skinny skin-on fries were very tasty.  My Vienna Premium Beef Chicago Dog on a soft and steamed Vienna Poppy Seed Bun was authentic and delicious.  And, my 3\"" Italian Beef Sandwich with sweet peppers on a Gonnella Italian Style Roll that had been drenched in Au Jus was simply great with and without Giardiniera.  Again I got the most bang for my buck by ordering the #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds.  Especially for dinner, it would be a shame to only consume one sandwich or dog here, in any event!  \n\nThe proprietors, who are hands-on owners, were very friendly, and service was first-rate.  Ambiance is Windy City Chicago sports all the way, with great-tasting Chi-Town comfort food."
0,"alas, since my first meal here in Oct 2010, kitchen staff has changed and gone are the details which made this a formidable lunch bistro in the french style. BOO.\n\n#CROQUE MADAME\nsee my pic of the most spectacular Croque Madame I've had in my life. it was here, back in Oct 2010. \nunfortunately, the Dec 2012 version is too eggy, not enough ham, boring bechamel and missing the frisee and vinaigrette which balanced this dish and made it so delightful to photograph and look at.\n\n#BEEF TARTARE\nI won't even bother with ground beef tartare anymore. it's a preference. a strong one.\n\n#AYCD BLOODY MARY\nGreat price for all-you-can-drink bloody mary, but it's so goddam spicy that i can barely get the first one down. And this is from the guy who sprinkles ghost chili flakes on my fried chicken.\n\n#DECOR\nlike the harsh presentation of food, the restaurant lacks the balance of soft touches and color. mounted cold white plates and orangey-brown liquid in metronomically placed-in-a-row comme-ca-monogrammed wine bottles just don't cut it.\n\n!VIEW\nThe windows give you full view of Las Vegas Blvd traffic just below you, and to the north the faux Eiffel. [shaking head... you just can't get away from it, either here or in Paris itself  :P  ]\n\nnot for lack of wanting to revisit comme ca; it's just that i'm rarely in vegas on a friday, sat or sun for lunch.\ntrue to french lunch hours, you cannot get in before noon."
1,Another one of my favorite brands. Whenever I'm in Vegas I have to stop by this store. Always have some good sales on some nice clothes. \n\nBen Sherman is dope!
1,My favorite sandwich place ....ABSOLUTELY!\nI love their Italian sandwich......also their meatball one....they know how to make it delish without making it soggy with the sauce.\nI think their store on state st is pretty cool...love sitting there and chatting with the wife.
0,"Terribly maintained. The greens are worn and ripped all over the place. Nice layout, but I just had to shake my head at how poorly maintained this place was. It was as if management never took a look. Just awful."
0,"Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.\n\nI also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt/napkin/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.\n\n+1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up."
1,"Sunday night, one week after the Steelers were officially \""out\"".  The restaurant was not crowded.  There were (2) 20-somethings and (2) 50-somethings which turned into (2) Burgers (1) Pulled Pork and (1) Angus Salad.  \n\nEverything was done perfectly.  Calamari was spicy, tender and fantastic.\n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  Almost too dark to enjoy the meal, but ok.  We all agreed that we'd like to go back and try out a few other menu items.  Especially in the summer, to try out the patio!"
1,"This my favorite show!!!!!! I first saw this show last year because I had a coupon and had such a good time I had to go back this year and see it again! Tina is by far my favorite! I will be seeing this show every time I go back to vegas, it is a must. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an energetic, fun, entertaining show!!!"
0,"absolutely lethargic, inexcusable and pathetic service, take ur money somewhere else, after 20 mins of waiting t the table there was no sign if service, even after complaining to the person in charge nothing changed, seriously expect people to shell $16 per dish with this sort if sloppy service..one of our worst experiences at a thai restaurant ever."
1,"Haven't had a bad meal yet! They are always hopping and you sometimes have to wait a bit for your food...but it is so worth it!!\nThe food is a little high priced, but groupon has deals often.\nTheir chili is fantastic, whether you use it for your fries or just get the chili bowl with onions and cheese. The chicken club sandwich is tender and all their burgers are more than filling."
1,Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
1,"I went shopping here and liked it- don't expect Ross Dress for Less prices, as it's not cheap, but it's cheaper than the regular Nordstrom.  And for you uptown folks, you can take the light rail line to the end of the line and then walk just across the street and across part of the parking lot and you're there."
1,"If one had asked me 10 years ago if I'd ever eat somewhere with the caliber and focus of an institution like Binkley's, I would have pondered for a minute and probably responded only if it was by the desire and grace of a girlfriend's sufficiently endowed parents or a reception catered by the Google Gillionaires I would surely be surrounded by as a result of a blossoming interest in the tech industry. If one had asked if I'd ever be there at the suggestion of my family who would be equally, if not more, at home at Claimjumper, I wouldn't have deigned the question worthy of response at all.\n\nI would have been (at least temporarily) wrong.\n\nAt the behest of a curious mother living nearby for years, we ventured. Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety, Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings, and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks:\n\n- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame\n- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine\n- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home\n- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus ($82 - $89, wine pairing $40-50 extra) like non-confused VIPs, but skipping the foie gras surcharge (+$14)\n- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity\n- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches\n- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered\n- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase, except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal\n- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer, including a superb soft shell crab course\n- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates\n- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course, an amuse of chocolate souffle \n- Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free ($2.50) despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them\n- Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not years\n\nMenu guidance would be a futile endeavor since, as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables, it turns over completely around every two weeks. However, overall, the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat, of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main. Instead:\n\n- Prepare for the onslaught of Kevin Binkley's culinary whims\n- Pretend the a la carte menu doesn't exist\n- Make a reservation well in advance, especially for a weekend\n- Bring your wallet, possibly two\n- Expect to spend at least 3 hours luxuriating over the meal\n- Sigh longingly while realizing how far in the future the next justifiable visit will be\n\nRegardless of apprehension, except in the face of a diet with statistically outlying strictness, it's worth trying once for a special occasion to form one's own opinion. While I could easily think of a number of small tweaks, the application of the formulaic main draw is, in Yelp's terms, semantically indistinguishable from as good as it gets."
0,"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said \"" do you want to consign your table or not!\"".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....\nThe next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!"
0,I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.
1,"I never thought I'd like poutine, and I certainly don't want to eat it every day, but this stuff was really good. Get it with some bacon or sausage on top. Excellent for teenage boys."
1,"After seeing Peter A's review, I totally had to check it out. I've been craving a burger lately but didn't feel like traveling too far. Plus who can pass up a hot dog! We walked into a pretty crowded place on a Sunday at 1pm. We sat down and ordered some drinks. My husband and I debated the menu for a bit. There were so many things that sounded so good. We finally decided on an order of buffalo cheesy fries, a guacamole jalape\u00f1o burger for me, a pastrami burger for hubby, a corn dog kids meal and a kraut dog to share. \nBuffalo cheesy fries - slightly tangy sauce with melted cheese. They weren't salty or spicy but were good.\nGuacamole jalape\u00f1o burger - I devoured this. The guacamole was creamy. There were just enough jalape\u00f1os to give it a little kick without overpowering it. Yummy deliciousness. \nPastrami burger - I took a bite. I just had to. It looked too good. The mustard had just the right kick. The pastrami complimented the burger in such the right way. \nKraut dog - oh snap... Literally! It was so good. Just enough spicy mustard and kraut. The kraut was crisp and wasn't too sour. \nCorn dog - nothing special. The stick said Foster's Farm. \n\nThis is going to be my local go to for a good burger and hot dog."
0,"I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds."
0,"This place is a $hit shack.  We had some coupons and went there on SuperBowl Sunday.  2 chickens and a bunch of sides cost us $40.  It just wasn't worth it.  Plus there is nowhere to park.  If the 5 spots are filled out front, you're screwed due to the poor design and layout of this store, to its parking lot.\n\nSave yourself the trouble.   Go to Costco, Albertsons or Frys and buy one of their pre-made chickens for $5. Shoot...buy 3 of them.   Buy your own sides (Kraft Mac-n-cheese, Bushes baked beans, instant mashed potatoes) and make them yourself.  \n\nFeel better you didn't give $40 to this crappy establishment."
0,"Look, I am a local in Las Vegas so I know that you are going to be paying a premium to eat on the strip, but as far as nickel and diming its customers, Circo takes the cake. \n\nIf you are going to charge that amount for food, it better be something good. There better be fresh ingredients, there should be good service, and there should be a decent ambiance. \n\nCirco had none of these traits.\n\nFirst, I never would have gone to this restaurant if it weren't for a group that convinced me to go with them. Before we went into the Circo we decided to have a drink at the bar across the way. I struck up a conversation with the bartender there about living in Las Vegas among other things. The bartender was a nice regular guy with the twang of one of the \""boys\"" from the old days. After talking for a while he asked at which restaurant we were eating. I replied \""Circo\"" and he laughed and said, \""Hope you brought your checkbook.\""....Bad Omen.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\n\nWe get there and the atmosphere is like children of the corn meets Candyland. It seriously reminded me of the part in \""Fear and Loathing\"" where Gonzo had to be pulled off the Circus Circus carousel because he took too much ether.\n\nThere are demonic Monkeys on tricycles and clowns hanging from the ceiling. Why anyone would want to eat in a place like this is totally 100% beyond my comprehension. Unless of course they are a serial killer who decided to stop taking his meds.\n\nI understand the whole \""French people like this sort of thing\"" thing, so ok, I can get past it. \n\nPlus the fountains were nice to watch, but I was always hesitant to watch them as I was sure as soon as I turned my back on the tricycle monkey from hell I would get a shank to the back.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nFirst of all, the food names on the menu don't actually make any sense. like for instance, if its a Caesar salad, call it a Caesar salad. Dont call it \""Bagna Cauda\"" because that's not even what  Bagna Cauda is...\n\nBagna Cauda is akin to a garlic and anchovy fondue. Hence why it translates to \""Warm Bath\""\n\nBagna Cauda is NOT A CAESAR SALAD. And, by the way, I'm pretty sure they import their Caesar salad from pizza hut because it tastes exactly the same and has the same ingredients....But at least the pizza hut Caesar salad doesn't cost you 18 DOLLARS!\n\nI have to laugh at the other reviewers that posted saying this is \""Authentic Italian\""\n\nI digress again. I wanted to stay on the cheap side of things so I just ordered a roasted garden vegetable pizza and got a Peroni to whet the whistle. I figure O.K. you cant really screw this up.\n\nThe Peroni comes out first (Peroni is like the Italian Budweiser...Its at the most about 13 bucks for a 12 pack at the corner store.) So i'm thinking for 9 bucks they are going to come out with a Hafbrauhaus style 1 liter stein for me to drink out of...\n\nWRONG...it comes out in apparently a drink-ware made for tiny people from another time period. On the bright side though it made my hand look gigantic in the pictures we took.\n\nThe grilled \""garden vegetable\"" pizza came out next...Since I knew I was getting bent over anyway for eating at the Bellagio I wasn't expecting too much. At least it met my expectations. The \""Garden Vegetables\"" were the typical Eggplant and zucchini that were grilled using the same time honored techniques as used by traditional airline stewardesses. And the crust tasted like Boboli. (I actually like Boboli crust so its not knocking Boboli...but I dont really want to pay 24 bucks for it.)\n\nThe girls got some other food that nobody could ever pronounce and they liked it at the time. It seemed fancy and shiny and girls like that sort of thing. But afterward, when they got back to their rooms they were face-down in the toilet from either food poisoning or they had become possessed by the monkey demon king. I'm guessing food poisoning since from my point of view, their fish was actually fresh sometime during the Carter administration.\n\nTHE SERVICE\n\nApparently Circo is way too trendy for ice water... Because they don't give you any. Which is O.K. since when the waiter actually DID come around to pour the warm water he would extend his arm across to reach for the glass, thus revealing the ripe smell of industrial armpits. I had to keep checking him to make sure his shirt wasn't melting onto the table.\n\nThe main waiter was probably nice, but I wouldn't actually know that since not even a babelfish could translate what he was saying. At least in the end he tried to stiff us on the check which had a couple charges that we didn't make. \n\nNow that I think about it, im pretty sure the reason why they use erroneous menu terms is so that they can add it to the end bill and nobody would be the wiser.\n\nAll in all I managed to only spend 40 bucks and still look like I wasn't the cheapest man on earth to the present company. Even with my 40 dollar tab, our 6 person table was able to rack up a 480 dollar check only getting half entrees and apps.\n\nNever again Ci"
0,"I guess I was expecting more.  The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good.  But I guess growing local and being \""fresh\"" come at a cost.  Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room."
1,"Came to Vegas and wanted to try something different other than buffetts. I tried this place and I have to say it was pretty good. The portions are huge, you might want to share. They have a variety of food, and also specialty drinks. Overall everything was good."
1,Best margaritas in town!\n\nFood is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!
1,"Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs, air filters, and other automotive bits.  They also offer a huge selection of housewares and hardware.  Also, this place is CHEAP.  \n\nOne other thing: if you're a student going to a barn dance, Farm and Fleet is your one stop shop for flannel shirts, farm boots, and enormous belt buckles."
1,"We used a groupon for my wife and I and enjoyed the massage/detox. They didn't short us any time and the only comment I would make is to communicate if the masseuse is too strong. They will happily cater to your needs and we left feeling relaxed and refreshed. They massaged our heads, necks, shoulders, arms, feet, and legs. Overall we were very happy."
1,"Every time I visit this place, it just gets better. \n\nFirst, their selection keeps expanding. As a Gibson and Orange lover, I am in heaven walking into this place. Decent selection of used stuff as well (was sad to NOT see the Ibanez lawsuit les paul rip off in there this last time, but hope that means it sold!). \n\nBy far the best atmosphere of any music shop in town. Has a very \""Chicago Music Exchange\"" vibe, with couches and chairs set up in classy little arrangements, wood floors, and bare brick walls. It definitely has the feel of a higher end boutique shop, which is cool. Contrast that with the fact that the staff is extremely unpretentious, affable, and inviting. Everytime I've been in there, the employees have repeatedly asked if I want to play anything (which... yes, I want to play everything). Short haired blond lady, small shaved head guy, and taller brown haired guy all just seem completely approachable and like they're as happy to talk shop as I am. Love the staff there.\n\nOverall, this is a shop that I hope sticks around. I will definitely be making the effort to abstain from the online giants in favor of supporting these guys."

0,This is a disgusting place which serves a what looks like an hour by hour hotel room.  Don't do it!!!!!!   The staff creepy....like something out of psycho.  Beware!!!!
0,I remember coming to this location with my family every time we were in Vegas. I wanted something cheap and delicious. I found the latter! \n\nOrdered the: \n* 1/2 Roasted Duck - It was actually quite good here but my boyfriend commented on the small portions compared to Cali Sam Woos. \n* BBQ Pork & Chicken Rice - Ahh tasted just like home\n* Veggies (suggested seasonal veggies) - simply saut\u00e9ed with some garlic & salt. Srzly can't go wrong. \n\nIt was quite expensive here though - bill came out to be around $50 or so. I mean sure we ate for 3 MORE meals but....\nAND it's cash only. \n\nI think I'm going to try Capital Seafood upstairs next time.
0,"I have only had the pizza here.  Did not impress me, just fair to average pizza.  I have no plans to try it again."
1,"Wish it had a drive thru, but otherwise a nice location. Inside there is a lot of room and plenty of tables to sit and hang out. There are power outlets if you look, so you can also charge the computer, etc., while having coffee."
1,"This was my first time going to a restaurant that offered really healthy dishes and foods of this scale. I came in here not knowing what to expect. It's a cute place with nice, fresh decorations! The cashiers were really nice and easy to talk to - they explained thoroughly any foods and drinks I had questions about. Though it is pricey, the quality of the food does show.\n\nI got the summer berry salad, which consists of berries, spinach, goat cheese, and raspberry vinaigrette. The ingredients were really fresh! Some of the berries are REALLY sweet by themselves, but the taste can be easily toned down if you eat the spinach and goat cheese with it in one bite. The contents of the salad worked harmoniously with themselves!\n\nI also got the white chocolate veggiechino, which is their healthier version of the frappucino. I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no! It was pleasantly sweet, even with all the greens they put in there. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks frappucinos at all, which was very nice.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't mind coming here again. Maybe next time I'll try the Thai peanut chicken satays."
1,"You can't go wrong with this place. Anything you order will melt your heart and have you wishing you lived near this bakery. Sometimes there is a line and nowhere to sit but who cares. Learn to be patient , walk to the nearest park and enjoy bliss."
0,"This is for the nightclub only. \n\nWe had a group of four guys and five girls. We were on a promoter's guestlist, so we skipped the general admission line. It was the longest wait at a club all weekend, maybe 10 minutes, max. The girls were free, the guys were discounted at $30 (wtf is general admission price then for this club?), yikes.\n\nWe headed upstairs...we had about 20 minutes of the open bar left. I found an open spot at the bar right away and got a drink. After all of the girls got our round of drinks, we all headed to the dance floor.\n\nThe opening DJ played old school music...not like good 90's old school music, but like between 2000-2005, that reminded you of high school dances. DJ Vice was the headlining DJ and he was pretty good. \n\nPeople were not joking when they said people are next to each other like sardines in a can. I don't know what it was about this crowd...if the girls here are lightweights and took full advantage of the open bar, or what. But these people were DRUNK. And not even drunk, but ANN0YING drunk. \n\nThe trapeze girl floating above the crowd was pretty cool. It's a nice looking club, but it's WAY too crowded. I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this club...but whatever. To each-their-own. The only way that I'd come to this club again is if I had a table. 0ther than that, this one can be checked off my \""to-do\"" list."
0,"Dr. Baig has poor bedside manner and has no clue how to be a well rounded doctor. He may be a good surgeon (however I would not let him operate on me so I will never find out) but I have been to doctors that care about their patients, that don't interrupt their patients, and that have some empathy for their patients and that are reasonably punctual). Unfortunately, Dr. Baig during my office visits has exhibited none of these critical characteristics. I know there are much better choices out there unfortunately from Dr Baig's demeanor it is obvious that he doesn't know that.  His staff is nice, no issues. Also, he was over 40 minutes late to all of my appointments."
0,"Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off."
1,"This was my second time here.  Service was great and my water was kept full.  I ordered the special of the day: portabella mushroom ravioli with choice of sauce.  I decided to be demanding and asked for 1/2 alfredo 1/2 marinara.  They put the sauces in bowls and allowed me to sauce it myself.\nMy friends mostly got the special as well, except one person got a greek pizza.  It looked really good.  I enjoyed the ravioli, but my friends weren't too keen on it.\n\nthey have a bar opening soon from what they were saying so Riccio's is expanding."
1,"I just wanted to complement Ali Murray, the Catering Sales Manager at the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas.  I had been communicating with Ali regarding possibly having an upcoming event at the resort.  She was extremely timely, helpful, and detailed in her email responses.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was able to pre-arrange a meeting in person to discuss details, and she was even waiting in the lobby when we arrived. She gave us an outstanding and thorough tour of the Mandarin Oriental, which by the way is gorgeous!  Ali also followed up upon our return to see if there was any additional assistance she could provide.  \n\nAs far as the resort itself goes, the Mandarin Oriental is sophisticated and provides a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, among the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, without being far removed.  it is definitely the best of both worlds.  \n\nAlthough, we ultimately decided to go in a different direction, we will definitely consider this resort for future events.  Hopefully, Ali will still be there!  She is sensational, a joy to meet, and represents the best of the Mandarin Oriental.  I would HIGHLY recommend working with her."
1,Everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with the dolsot bibimbap and the galbi is extremely tender and flavorful. They give generous portions of the banchan sides and the people are very friendly and accommodating. I recommend if you're looking for good Korean food in the valley.
0,"Went here for a birthday dinner during a girls only weekend in Vegas. What a perfect place to go to with a bunch of girls surrounded by cute servers and bus boys! \n\nThe menu is in Italian with English descriptions of the meals. You really have to take your time to read it (unless of course you can read and understand Italian). The portion sizes are large enough for sharing which is perfect for keeping a high cost meal on the cheaper side.\n\nThe whole experience and food was great but if I'm back in Vegas, and craving Italian, I'll explore my options a lot more."
1,"Holy freaking YES . . . fist pulling with excitement . . . yes, yes, yes. I found the one. Lucky Queen Creek, Arizona. The place goes by the name of (drumroll, please) Golden Harvest. Real. Good. Authentic. Chinese. Love. Love. Love. Love.\n\nCare for a Yum Check?\nCashew Chicken: yum.\nSweet and Sour Chicken: yum.\nDumplings: YUM.\nKung Pao Chicken: YUM.\nOrange Chicken: YUM!!!!\n\nThank god there's a delicious Chinese restaurant in AZ."
0,This is my first time in Madison and my first restaurant we visited.  Well if my experience at marigold kitchen is what Madison is about....this will be my last visit here.  When we approached the counter we were immediately treated as though we were NOT welcome.  I felt more like an inconvenience then a customer.  When we sat my food arrived 15 minutes before the rest of my table did so I ate cold food.  Marigold kitchen...you should be ashamed.  I would recommend McDonald's before marigold kitchen. Don't know the name of the pregnant woman who initially helped us but sounds like she makes a habit of treating customers poorly.
0,"This review started as one about Chompie's at the PV Mall. We will never again go to this Chompie's.  See below:\n\n\""We have been going to the Chompie's on Shea for over two years and really enjoyed the Hometown NY food and atmosphere. It reminded us of all the good things that you would find at Katz's in lower Manhattan. \n\n\""Okay, so why the setup for another Chompie's location?  Well the last few times at the Shea location we sat and waited, and waited(15 mins or so) for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order. Hey, when you're busy that's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty.  Also, it seems whenever we asked for anything (pickles, napkins, etc) our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us.  It happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough. \n\n\""Well, our trek in the desert has been rewarded. This Chompie's (PV Mall) is everything the other one wasn't.  The wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drinks order & offered suggestions on different menu items. We were thrilled. We didn't realize there was another Chompie's nearby.  And the food was great (just like the one on Shea)!\n\n\""From now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the PV Mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on Shea.  If you're into Katz's and some Catskill theater then you might enjoy the Chompie's on Shea, we didn't!\""  When the wait staff stand around talking while you're hungry, it's a real mood kill.\n\nSo go to Chompie's at the PV Mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously.  Oh, BTW there's a ton of parking available at PV another difference in their favor.  Enjoy!"
0,"Closed. Out of business, at least when trying to check the place out on July 14, 2010."
0,"Stopped in for breakfast. What can I say. This was about the worst airport food ever!\n\nI ordered the bacon ommlet thinking bacon makes everything good. Not this time.  It was basically covered with cheese wiz straight from the can.  The wiz covered everything on the plate except for the toast which was burnt on side and cold on the other.  \n\nThe only good comment I can make is that the server was friendly and the serive was good.  If you are here and looking for breakfast, go to burger king as you'll have better food!"
0,I was so excited to go to this place especially for their 40 cent wing night. What a let down!
1,"The only coffee place for me. Super love the earl grey latte.  The only alternative to coffee. I feel like I'm close to home wherever there is a CBTL.  Sounds silly, but 100% true.  I like the fact that it's right around the corner from the entrance to PH's casino floor.  I leave my machine for a quick dash for my drink and probably the only thing that's worth the quick dash.\nI think we all appreciate the free wi-fi - the casino doesn't even offer free wi-fi."
1,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
0,Bait and switch.  They'll let your children participate in creating a craft and then charge you to keep it.
0,"Old Vegas.  You are really just a step above you're ugly cousin, Reno. \n\nBut Binions...oh, Binions...\n\nYou are kind of like Ballys' skanky auntie.  You know, the one no one talks about since she came out of rehab.  The one who likes to wear all that flashy gold jewelry with open toe shoes and you know she hasn't had a pedicure in a few years.  THAT auntie.    \n\nI sat in silence as I watched El Hub and friends play craps.  Of course this was after the picture taking adventure with the Mr. T little person standing outside.   I proceeded to observe two older ladies with matching fanny packs try their luck on the \""QUEEN: FREDDY MERCURY\"" slot machine.  How many times can you hear \""Another One Bites the Dust\"" over and over?  I wasn't willing to find out.  \n\nNot really a breath of fresh air from Fremont St."
1,"First, I'm not a big musicals guy. I was able to get half price tickets which made it even better but this show is enjoyable even at full price. \n\nThe show lasts about two hours and does a good job of mixing singing Four Seasons songs with the stories about the band members and how they joined and in some cases left the band. My parents are fans so I grew up with their music on the oldies station in the car but had no idea about their history really. It's an interesting story and worth a look in Vegas, give it five stars if you're a hard core four seasons fan. It's an older crowd mostly and the woman in the row ahead of us must have been 80 but was rocking out."
0,"This place is ok. Really not much more to say....but I will! All of our hamburgers were burnt and dry. Not good. The onion rings were tasty, fries were average and price was steep. You can \""build your own\"" so that's interesting but it didn't matter what I had on there - it was burnt. \n\nWe got 3 meals for $45 - oddly, there was a 10% discount for paying with cash."
0,"Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\"" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.\nI don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre."
0,"I think we just went on an off day. The scary part was entirely closed. It said someone would be back at 6.45, but it was after then and there was no one around. The photographers were completely ignoring us, so my mum and I couldn't get a picture with us both in it, and the bar was unstaffed. The main parts I wanted to see were Lady GaGa (which I did) and the scary part (nope), and we could only take pictures of each other, not one with both, so it was kind of a bust.\nI do like that you are free to touch and pose with all the wax figures, though. \nI'd go back again and give it another shot."
0,"I was really excited because this looks like a really cute place. But the service was awful. I came in and stood by the hostess stand waiting for my party, no one greeted me or came to the front. The manager? and the bartender also ignored me, even though I was 3 feet from them. When the hostess finally came, it was to tell me she would be with me in 10 mns, like I was bothering her. Then we sat at our table for 15 mns before anyone came over. Food was good, HORRIBLE service."
0,"Is no stars an option? Unfortunately, I made the mistake of bringing my out of town family here for a bon voyage breakfast.  I haven't had service this bad in years, not to mention half of our table was served their cold meals 15 minutes before the other half. When we asked the waitress if we could have butter (with our un-buttered toast) we were answered with a scoff and a forced \""sure.\"" My poor grandmother took one bite of her eggs and the whole table could hear the crunch of the eggshells between her teeth. This too was addressed with a passive response and nothing to be done about it. It was quite interesting to \""eat in shifts,\"" since each person received their meals at different times. I could go on with the continues wrong orders placed on the table and how we eventually had to learn to just except what we did not order, but, this experience was most definitely one for the books. Wow! I will never come to, or bring my family here again to suffer through the horrific attitudes of our waitress (to specify it was solely the waitress) and the cold crunchy meals we left on our plates."
1,Probably the best Korean in town.  Expensive but so is Ah-ri-rang (their competitor).  This place introduced me to korean food so I can recommend it for people looking to try korean.  They have unlimited soup (jigae?) and hot/cold water to make tea with if you want to don't miss that.\n\nIf you're more adventurous try a Jigae (korean stew) or Dolcet Bibim Bop.  If you're lame then get Bulgoki like everyone else :-p
0,"Okay, it was a close Sushi place and I was in the mood for Sushi. So what the heck, the reviews were so-so and I thought I would give it a try. I debated for way to long on weather to just order rolls or do the AYCE method. I decided that I could just eat a couple of rolls and be happy so I ordered a couple of everyday rolls. A California Hand-roll, Philadelphia Roll and a Tootsie Roll. The Tootsie Roll was far sweeter than any Tootsie Roll I've had in the past, in fact too sweet, I think it set the stage for the rest. \n\nThe California Hand-roll was pretty good, it's pretty basic and easy enough, and it really didn't disappoint. The Philadelphia Roll is one of my favorites in general and it was okay. \n\nService was pretty slow, but everyone was very friendly and you could tell the regulars as they interacted with the staff quite a bit and really enjoyed themselves. The fact that they have regulars and are quite friendly is a testament to them. \n\nPersonally, I didn't come out of there thinking, man I have to go back it was that good. I would go back if I was eating with someone that wanted to eat there, but it won't be a place that I will necessarily recommend."
1,"Blackjack Switch, BITCH!!!!\n\nBack in my good ole' 21 year old days, we would come here because it was one of the few casinos on the strip that had Blackjack Switch. Now, the bigger casinos are starting to incorporate it into their lineup because it's that good. (If you haven't learnt to play, LEARN. It's basically Blackjack but with better odds of winning for the player, in my opinion.) \n\nAt Casino Royale though, you can play BJ Switch (sounds like a kinky swingers thing) with a table minimum of only $5. It's perfect for when you actually want to make your cash last you a few hours. \n\nThe dealers here are one of a kind. My favorite is Ruta - sweetest girl in the world - who I met a few years back and try to say hi to whenever I'm in Vegas (even though she never remembers me, ouch). The rest are CRAZY. I had a dealer once who kept messing up the payouts and would be like, 'Whoops, I forgot to give you your money. Here it is. Don't say anything, shhh', the hugest dealer no-no!! I had another dealer who talked about her days doing coke in Atlantic City. Just laugh along and hope they bring good luck to the table! If you want to learn how to play a table game, Casino Royale's the place as most of the dealers are helpful and friendly enough.\n\nAnd the strawberry margaritas!!! They're these tiny, but super sweet slushy concoctions that you can get free while playing at the tables. If your tummy doesn't ache after 3 or 4 of them, you'll at least have a small buzz.\n\nWhile you won't find a lot of bachelorette groups playing at Casino Royale, you will see plenty of bachelors. There were a bunch of guys that came and went when my friend and I were playing at a table on this last trip. A few of them were really cute, too, except I was too engaged in the game to notice or care. But for all you ladies on the hunt, Casino Royale's got the hookup! \n\nCasino Royale's got that old school Vegas glam that's slowly beeing weeded off the strip. There's nothing wrong with the big names like Encore, but Casino Royale reminds me of the Vegas that used to be family friendly and didn't require a buttload of money. In about 10 years, Bellagio is going to be a has-been and Casino Royale will still be going strong. I'd put my money on it."
0,Stay Away!!! Not sure what any of these people who reviewed this hotel are talking about. I had the worst experience of my life at this hotel. The staff was rude and thought my friends and I couldn't afford a place like this.\n\nI have travelled all over the world and I would rather sleep on the street than stay at this hotel again!
1,"My Dad lives in Las Vegas and I seen the episode on Tanked (the show that makes these outrageous aquariums). They did one for Popcorn Girl and after seeing the episode, how could you not want go and visit the website to see all the amazing, crazy flavors of popcorn that they had.\n\nWell I did immediately. And was hesitant to have them ship it to me, when I can just stop there the next time I visit my Dad...\n\nWell my Dad made a decision for a quick weekend visit to Dallas, and I quickly asked him to stop by Popcorn Girl to get us a few small bags to bring on his carry on bag.\n\nSOOOO to the Popcorn part of the review.. \n\nO.M.G the dill pickle.. yes, yes, yes... I get extra pickles anytime there are pickles around anywhere. So I had to try it out.. and it was actually my favorite out of the three flavors we got.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Wacky Watermelon, we both weren't too crazy about it. It did taste like watermelon non the less.\n\nAnd I also got the Loaded Baked Potato flavor as the reviews were pretty good."
1,"I brought my girl to this show last night. There was 3 performers and 1 host. Host was really funny, moved the show very well, good for younger crowd. all 3 comedians and the headliner were hilarious. They all handled hecklers well, more relatable to a younger crowd. Some jokes about social media had me rolling but left the older white crowd in the dust. Great for a date night, low ticket cost, can find good deals all over the web. Dress casual."

I purchased my stay through Travelocity (as I often do for my travels) and the front desk clerk even acknowledged that, but STILL... double the charge!  This has never happened to me with Travelocity so I can only believe the mistake was on the hotel end.  I called several times to try and resolve this with Susan in billing but she was not very responsive.  It was after several attempts and contacting the general manager Patty that I got a \""promise that a credit will be issued.\""  I keep calling AMEX to check and still NOTHING.......

1,"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! It's a twister! It's a twister!!\n\nI've been hearing a lot of people say to me that Sushi Twister makes some of the best sushi in town. Well,not quite. But, Sushi Twister is making some good sushi over on the east side of Vegas. \n\nFirst, for those living on the east side near boulder highway and Trop, and around that area, this might be your only option for AYCE sushi. And, it's not really such a bad option.\n\nAfter walking in and sitting down at the bar, I was later told by the sushi chef that  Sushi Twister is owned by the same people that own Ramen Sora in Chinatown. I was expecting a lot, and I think that they delivered nicely.\n\nOrdered too much to analyse bit by bit, but will try to give an overall impression. I thought the fish and seafood quality was good, but not great. I also thought that the rice was a tad bit on the slightly sour side. I also thought that their signature sauce that they put on many of the apps and nigiri, sort of a yuzu-type soy sauce, was too sour as well. As for the apps, I really liked the chicken karage, it was crispy, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely.\n\nSo, I like this spot, but it's a drive from me so i'll stick to my favoritos. But, for those that live in the area, this is a super solid option for those who don't wanna travel to Spring Mtn. Rd., but would still like some quality sushi."

If you are an environmentalist, this sport will drive the \""Mother Earth\"" in you insane! There will be empty cans of beer & trash flying all over...not to mention one of the main parts of this sport is using a lot of fuel.\n9. You will smell a lot of fumes, feel the vibration of the cars, and see blurs whiz by...if you get motion sick, take breaks from the track.\n10. Beer bongs are encouraged...don't forget yours, but I'm sure you can find someone who will share theirs.\n\nThe roar of the engines is really exciting! I really liked watching how fast and flawless the pit crews worked too. It's quite the experience to be there live! \n\nAfter my first race, I read more about the sport...pretty interesting. I think the next time I go, I'm definitely renting a radio so I can listen in on the drivers and announcers. Everyone should go at least once!"
1,This place is a great place to help your kids get started on just about instrument. I would recommend this studio for any budding music learners!
0,"It was A LOT of money for nothing that was too impressive!  I spent $250.00 for a dinner for two and it was probably worth $120.00 at the most.  The service started out great but at the end of the night when I needed my check because I was going to the \""O\"" show my waitress looked irritated that I asked her for the check.  She had disappeared for almost 20 minutes prior to my asking.  We were already there for one hour and 40 minutes.  How much time do you need to eat???\n\nFor this price, treat yourself right and eat at Prime (a steakhouse that is also located in the Bellagio as well).  ALSO...I saw a really good deal at \""Brand\"" another one of the Lighthouse Group Restaurants in the Monte Carlo.  They had a steak dinner for two for around $90.00!  Give that a try instead, but I won't be back here again!"
0,"I give the food 4 stars; it's pretty decent although it is pricey for what you get.  But hey, it is the Strip after all.\n\nThe service I give 1/2 star (thus the average of about 2 stars).  We watched time and again as our waiter breezed past our table, without so much as a glance toward our empty glasses, in order to pander to larger groups.  Obviously he thought he was going to get bigger tips from them...turns out he was right.  It didn't have to be that way though.  \n\nHere is my tip to the Red 8 wait staff:  Don't make the customers ask you for everything; if all their glasses are empty ask them if they need some more water or another drink.  If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.  Most importantly, even if your opinion is to the contrary, treat them as if they deserve to be dining in your fine restaurant."
0,"Great outdoor patio...the praise ends there. \n\nTerrible service ruined my evening with a group of friends. Seriously, slowest service ever and they didn't seem to give s**t. It wasn't busy and it seemed as though the staff were working against one another. Weird concept. I've been there more than once and this is my first bad experience, however, my friends have warned me that the service is brutal. \n\nSorry I'm not sorry."
0,"I completely regret moving in here, I may break my lease early to get out of this nightmare.\n\nI pay 1400$ a month to live in a safe and beautiful community - lol no. This place has more roaches than I have ever seen, even after having them spray twice I still find them three or four times a week. It is literally the most disgusting thing to open the dishwasher and find roaches. And I'm not even a messy person with food lying around."
1,"i love bevier cafe and i fear it may be my new go to destination for lunch over all the overpriced sandwich/pasta shops in campustown.  you can get a delicious full sized entree for under $5!! the ambience is a little like a dorm cafeteria but the service is efficient and the food is really tasty.  They also offer portable coffee mugs for $10 with $.50 refills for an eternity after! take that, espresso royale!!  on my graduate student budget, it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food (and the elixir of life- coffee!) at such an affordable price and in a convenient location.  sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch!"
1,"For the BEST in Ultra Fresh Seafood this is it. The Fish are line caught and flown in fresh everyday from Italy. Computer chips are inserted in fish to monitor the traveling temperature to insure perfection. A marine biologist is on staff to monitor the live tanks. You won't find that kind of care and quality anywhere else.\n\nWe tried a number of things since this was a splurge dining here. In general I found everything simplistic but done to perfection.\n\nWe were impressed with the priest chokers pasta, the texture was phenomenal. It wasn't fancy only butter and sage with pieces of turbot that melted in your mouth.\n\nFor dinner I wanted to try a fish I never had before. You get a whole fish that they sell by weight. The John Dory that they had last night was too big for two people so I picked the Gilthead Sea Bream with the tomatoes, arugula,garlic and red onion. The fish comes out on a cart, then the waiter cleans it and plates it with fresh vegetables and potato. The fish seemed slow cooked and really melted in your mouth. It was so light and fresh and the simple topping just enhanced the fish.\n\nWe had to try dessert and I don't get blown away by dessert often but the lemon cake is something YOU MUST TRY if you come here. It was just perfect, The perfect taste of lemon, it oozed lemon, it had crunch on the top and the rosemary gelato tasted so good with it.\n\nYes it's expensive. You get what you pay for."
0,"I have been interested in visiting this shop ever since I moved into Harrisburg.  I had heard nothing but good things about it, and it seemed to be in a good location, so I stopped in this evening.  I got some doughnuts and a cupcake.  I was surprised at the service, the first three items I requested had run out... and when I asked for a paper menu to take home, I was told that it could be found online (however, it cannot, the website doesn't work.)  Didn't seem like the associate was interested in helping me, but moreover getting me out the door. \n\nThe doughnut was nothing special, could have found a better and cheaper alternative at the supermarket.  The cupcake was dry, the frosting was hard and had a strange taste to it.  \n\nNot impressed overall, I wish this would have been a better experience, it would be great to have a nice bakery in town."

1,"Stayed here for one night to avoid having to drive back after a night of partying and really enjoyed my time here! Great customer service and clean rooms with really comfy beds [: Only thing I didn't like was the small pillows.. They were nice and fluffy but not even standard sized so I had to squish two together to simulate the effect.. I can't say much about their amenities because I wasn't really around to utilize them, but I did appreciate the free wi-fi and AC! Another cool thing about this place is their courtesy shuttle service.. Where I wanted to go for the night was out of their driving range, but if they don't need to take anyone else out and you tip handsomely they're willing to do it! A taxi would have been ridiculously expensive ($20 each way) so instead I tipped the drive $10 each way and got a safe ride for half the cost! Their front desk has 24 hour service so you can check-in/out as late as you wish, and they're always just a phone call or elevator ride away! The attendant that worked the 11pm-7am shift was extremely courteous and I appreciated his customer service [: If I'm ever around and in need of a place to stay I will most definitely choose this hotel.."

1,"Located at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets - South.  It's a bit small, but it has a decent selection of toys and the prices were GREAT.  We were able to find Octonaut figurines (if you don't have kids who watch Disney Jr., don't bother asking what this is) that we weren't able to get at home and which were much more expensive online.  Win - win!  Plus the employees were friendly and attentive."
1,"Blinded by the humongous neon banner outside the Miracle Mile fa\u00e7ade advertising, amongst other things, \""All you can eat pancakes, $6.99\"" (I think from 6-10am), my family wandered in here on a recent Saturday morning, pancakes on our minds. After walking through the casino floor (Planet Hollywood, I believe), we were promptly seated. Our waitress was lovely. We ordered some pancakes and were told that the $6.99 deal was only on weekdays. Really? The huge flashing banner doesn't say that (we checked on the way out, too. Unless it's in tiny writing on the following \""advertisement\"". Who knows). Anyhow, we kinda felt we were lured in here under false pretenses. But as long as we were there, we decided to have breakfast, s the menu is enormous, with tons of selections. I just ordered a poached egg (I can't eat much), but the family ordered granola and fruit, and granola with yogurt with fruit. And they LOVED their dishes. It was fairly healthy, large (but not grossly huge) portions, and tasty. \n\nMy egg was great (but it's rather hard to mess up that order...!).\n\nBreakfast was so good, in fact, that we returned the following morning. Being a weekday (Monday), one kid ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes. The rest of us had the same meals as the day prior. The pancakes were so big that my kid barely ate the first plate presented her; forget about more! They were fluffy and good. The waitress, who was also nice, said that few people ordered more. This time we were seated in a different area of the restaurant (it's a really large/deep space), and we were surrounded by wall-mounted TV's, all broadcasting different shows (some news, some sports, some entertainment). Personally, I found it quite distracting. Overkill. Perhaps that's just me.\n\nAgain we were impressed by the huge selection of foods on the menu. I liked how it was open 24/7, too, and I found the prices reasonable."
0,"Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food."

0,"Stopped in at Lo-Lo's after Disney on Ice about a week ago. We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles."
0,I thought that this store was going to be better than the stores I have been to in California.
1,"I make sure to always make a stop by Jean Phillipe every visit to Vegas. Their desserts are as beautiful as they are scrumptious, though they can be sickeningly saccharine.\n\nI try something new every time, and I've loved everything I've tried.\n\nMy favorites have been the vanilla napoleon and the nutella opera cake.\nThe chocolate cheesecake is a bit too sweet, but still amazingly rich and delicious.\n\nTheir gelato is great, I LOVED the strawberry, and I'm usually not a strawberry ice cream kinda gal. I've also tried the mint chocolate chip (yum!) and the pistachio (good, but have had better).\n\nI've only tried one of the breads, the dulce de leche on the recommendation of yelp. I asked the worker which was better, the almond brioche or the dulce de leche, and she recommended the leche, with a heaping cup of attitude on top. Whatever.\n\nI found it severely lacking. It was both too dry and waaaaaay too sweet. Not a fan! \n\nStill, I go back for the beautifully decorated and meticulously made desserts. My goal: try their whole menu!"
1,"Took a stroll through this mall in the evening (COLD for locals, WARM for me---50 degree, in shorts and a T).   Highlights: mega big Barnes and Noble with free wifi (got some travel books and magazines!), some good sales (although the beyotches working there were nowhere to be found for help in the dressing room, even when I walked in front of them gossiping at the counter to find other sizes myself....maybe I could have walked out of the store?).  Pre thanksgiving this place was dead, those eerie American landscapes of super clean sparking consumerism with only a few dead souls wandering through....I guess they will make up for it next week.  Nice clean outdoor feel and well lit/festive, awfully small but high tech food court."
1,"Legit Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas? Check! \n\nThey only serve small size dishes here. So you order a lot and share.\n\nTuna Sashimi Tofu Salad: I dont usually eat sashimi because I can't get passed the texture. But I decided to try it here. And it was soooo goooddd. Maybe cause it was chopped up. Maybe cause it was sooo freshh. Either way, I was thinking..\"" Where has this been all my life!!??\"" Favorite dish of the day.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#j3Vy1CPwzDo_5UWFrnkKQg\n\nSpider Roll: Portions was kinda small for a spider roll.

But the food is definitely fresh because you get to see all the chefs make the food for you in the kitchen."
1,"I'm still a member, but apparently this place has undergone a lot of changes since it first opened last year.  There are only a handful of the original instructors, but I really enjoy the diversity and varied workouts that each teacher has to offer.\n\nAmong the instructors, they also have some new people like Todd, Vadim (reigning Muay Thai champ in his weight class), with the veterans like Jason, Matt, Jessica, and Dustin.  \n\nTo be honest, I've been quite confused when it comes to who is teaching what and when, but even though the instructors have changed, the times remain the same.  I do like the fact that some instructors now use the focus mitts on a regular basis, as part of the workout and not just for personal training sessions.  The intimate classes are also pretty good, since it gives you a more individualized experience.  \n\nNot only has my endurance and stamina increased, but I feel like I'm getting stronger, more energetic, and more accustomed to the technique.  \n\nI definitely think that this gym has improved and continues to improve, so keep up the good work.\n\nMy only gripes are that they don't have actual cable channels on the tvs, but instead have some of the same fight videos playing on the flatscreen tvs.  I also wish that the price was more affordable on a monthly basis, in addition to more leniency on the contracts.\n\nAll in all, I enjoy being a member of LA Boxing and look forward to the changes to come--including more LA Boxing locations in the Vegas Valley."
1,"BRAVO!  I was so impressed by this show. First of all when you walk into the Wynn you feel like a million bucks and this venue is no different.  The music, the lighting, the water, and the stunts were amazing!  I am definitely going back to Le Reve the next time I go to Vegas.  I like how the seating is round so practically every seat is a great seat.  If you sit too close in the \""Splash Zone\"" you will get wet."
0,"Don't waste your time of money.\n\nI came in to Vegas for a friend's wedding. I had planned on getting a leg and Brazilian wax before I left but my normal aesthetician had a family emergency come up and had to cancel. \n\nI figured that once I got to Vegas I could hit up the spa and get it taken care of without trying to figure out how to get to some of the places off the strip. I was staying at the Luxor and though the price was about double what I'd usually pay I went ahead and booked the appointment. \n\nFirst I was surprised to know that they booked both full leg and Brazilians for 50minutes each! Damn Gina! In 2 hours my normal girl can wax me from head to toe and leave me looking smooth as a baby! To make matters worse, the girl actually took closer to 2 1/2 hours. I know I walked in looking like Sasquatch, but I've never had a wax take so long. She was incredibly nice, and made me feel comfortable which I consider really important when someone is all up in my hooha. \n\nStrike two occurred when I noticed  (though not until the end of the service) that the woman double dipped. WTF? I can't believe that any reputable spa would allow that. \n\nWhen she was finished I had to rush to leave because I was meeting friends and was running a bit late. So the next morning color me disappointed when I noticed several spots on my knees and the back of my thighs where patches of long hair was left. This wasn't the new growth patches that can be difficult to remove, these were spots that were completely overlooked. I also noticed a thumbprint bruise on my knee and also some smaller bruises on my pubic area. \n\nWhen I called to talk to a manager she stated that I needed to file a report with security. I literally had my entire weekend booked from start to finish so there wasn't really time for that. Instead I sent her pictures of the bruising on my knee. She asked what I would like for her to do about  and I said that I'd like to get my money back. She gave me half back.\n\nSo I ended up spending $90 instead of $180. Better but not great.\n\nEspecially when you consider that the price for both services were $150 and the extra $30 was mandatory gratuity. I don't understand why they didn't just increase their pricing if they're going to mandate gratuity.\n\nDefinitely don't recommend this place, at least not for waxing services."
0,"What a joke these reviews with 5 stars are or family friends or members.  Decor nothing special except for I pads tje cashiers where using. Atmosphere well there was a cook using a blender which made it a unique back ground. Dolmas no flavor, greek fries are a joke, gyro was dry and old not even long  slices tazaki was tasteless greek salad was okay fries where soggy we where the only table in the restaurant. Our bill was over $35 for lunch there are way better greek restaurants and way more affordable in the area. For all of u that gave those 5 stars go try some other greek spots in the area then u will understand what I'm saying."

1,"Since my initial visit during their first year opened, I've been back a handful of times and felt it was time I updated my review.  \n\nRaku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.\n\nWe attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  Sweet!  But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.\n\nThe thing to look out for is the Specials Board.  They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!\n\nThese days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  \n\nOne of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5).  It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  I don't know why it's so good but it just is.  And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  I just love it.\n\nAnother item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10).  There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  \n\nPoached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  It's a tasty nonetheless.  \n\nThe Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.\n\nI always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  Yum!\n\nSince they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! \n\nService on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.\n\nMy only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  Yuck.\n\nNonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it.  But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  \n\n4.5 stars."
0,"I've read numerous reviews this Nevada Wahoos is not what you'd get in California. I don't know about that. I've never had Wahoos in California before, but all I can say is that place is sub-par. \n\nThe ambiance is basically totally generic. There are lots of snowboarding and skate stickers pasted all over the place. I'm not sure what that means. Do snowboarders and skaters know what really good Mexican food is? Is that supposed to sway me or be cool? I've frequented really dumpy skater restaurants/bars before, but they were much worse, but in a good way (which gets points in my book because they're actually good). I've frequented really dumpy Mexican restaurants before and they were ALL good.\n\nI usually give a place two chances (unless I love it) before I dump on it, but this place is pretty mediocre. \n\nYou basically order at a fast food window, sit down at a table, then a guy brings the food out to you. Which he did. The first time my friend ordered a burrito and told them no cheese (like four times - he hates cheese because he's an idiot in my opinion - but he hates cheese). I ordered basically the same thing with cheese with sour cream. They never game me my sour cream and gave my friend cheese on his burrito. When i bit into my burrito, like 4 ounces of mystery liquid came out of it. Gross. \n\nThe second time I came to this place a friend of mine bit into a chicken taco and was about to throw up. I'm not sure it was the food though. It's pretty bad, but not enough to throw up. He's probably just a drama queen. \n\nMy second time I ordered a burrito without any vegetables and it was just okay. Nothing I'd come back for.\n\nIn my opinion, if you're really lazy and want to eat something good there are like a hundred other places down the street. However, the bar looked decent and probably had some NCAA basketball games going. That's about it."
0,We came here because it was recommended on a TV show. We are so disappointed!!  I can't even begin to tell you how SLOOOOOW the food and drinks were to come out. The Mojito was horrible. Way too much lime juice. I ordered the three mushroom plate. Why do the stuffings all need to be the same ?  Why couldn't I try 3 different ones?  Stupid rule that just cost you a returning customer. Bread pudding was burnt on one side and came with very little caramel sauce. Salmon was dry. SO disappointed in the entire experience. We won't be back.
1,Amazing food! Amazing ambiance! Excellent service. The GM came to talk with us and everything! Everyone come check out this new restaurant!
0,"Well as I predicted in my first review for this place, it did not last. Today I stopped by Li's bowl next door and Shakey Jakes was closed, good news is that there was some people looking at the place so maybe they'll reopen and create a better joint then the other owner. BBQ should have bold flavor, and that flavor should come from the meat, not the sauce that you might get lucky enough to find meat swimming in. I'd be glad to be an official taste tester before a possable reopening. Shakey Jakes didn't close becasue people didn't want BBQ, shakey Jakes closed because they didn't deliver in the taste catagory."

0,The $1.25 breakfast seemed appealing to my husband and he wanted to try it. I saw these cute looking Swedish desserts made with marzipan so I was curious about them so I picked one up. It is a cafeteria and you go threw a line just like you did at school. I didn't try any of the breakfast plate but to my eye the eggs seemed to have been cooked in a large batch in a steamer. The turkey sausage and potatoes didn't appear to be a fresh kind and had that certain frozen look to them like what you can find in your grocers freezer. You can see in my photo they look very processed.\n\nI go to try the little cake and have a taste of the frosting. Wow! it was terribly sweet and have a texture that was like liquid rubber with an awful after taste. So I peal some off and go for the inside. The cake tasted like something processed and a chemical fake raspberry taste was above it. I fear it had it had castoreum in it. If you don't know what castoreum is you possibly don't want to know what it is but you HAVE eaten some if you ever ate a Cadbury Cream Egg.\n\nA few things did look better than the breakfast like the tomato and cheese salad and the gravlax plates. \n\nIf you are a fan of the meatballs you can buy them in the store in the frozen section.\n\nI think most people have had food outside the box and have had better.\n\n1.5 Stars
0,"I am so upset and disappointed with Chipotle across from Sunset Station on Sunset Road. At 1:45pm 6/24/12, a husky latino young man, gave me the WORST service ever! I ordered a bowl with vegetables and steak, of which they apparently were running out. I get a significantly smaller portion than what I usually get at your restaurant. When I asked for more veggies to supplement the lack of both steak and veggies, the attendant said we are out; I said I would wait; he throws the plate away with an attitude and a dirty look, with no intention of giving me what I asked for. I had to spend my money at Spicy Pickle to get the food and service I deserve"

There are outside seats, but it still gets super crowded.\n*  service isn't stellar, but whatever.\n\nOverall:\n  I highly recommend this place for those that love sandwiches.  Really, you've just gotta try it for yourself.  If you have never been... here's a little heads up:  \nChoose your bag and grab a crayon.  Bubble in your choices and viola!  After making your selections and choosing whether you want to make it a combo, watch the sandwich artists clothespin your 'wich bag to a wire and zip-line that baby.  Not making any sense?  Just go in and check it out.  You'll see. \n\nTips:\n*  Pesto is a must.  \n*  Carb-Watching?  You can get any sandwich in a bowl instead.\n*  my personal recommendation is the Surf n Turf.  it's roast beef w/ imitation crab."
1,"The place has so much stuff going on! Aquariums, goldfish, crazy ceilings, etc. But when it comes to hand pulled noodles they're high in my charts.\n\nI had the chicken and mushroom sauced hand pulled noodle and it was so flavorful and the noodles were chewy and cooked to perfection. I loved everything about it, reminded me of korean jjajangmyun but more of a american gravy taste twist to it.\n\nMy friends had the chicken soup noodle dish and I can't remember if that was the correct name but it was so good!!!!!!! If you're hung over that is the ultimate soup!!! Just be ready for a nap afterwards!"
0,"Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \""I use cooks loosely\"".\nI would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"
0,"In life you get what you pay for and Bally's is a true example of this...\n\nWe did get the room for $39 a night, excluding tax, but no resort fees. The first night we checked in because we didn't make it by 4 PM, they gave us a room with two queens instead of a king as we requested. Instead of honoring it, they kept trying to upcharge us to move to the north tower for $30 a night, but why would we pay an extra $30 when we only paid $39 in the first place?!\n\nThe front desk was extremely slow for check in and check out. They weren't very friendly and not accommodating at all. I guess part of the cheap rates is the service too. The rooms are outdated and it shows. The first one we checked into smelled like smoke on a non-smoking floor. Fortunately, the second night we did get a king room (no apologies from the front desk) which did smell better. \n\nIt's the little things like the ventilation system and amenities that suck. Sure, the location may be good, but realize that even if something looks close in proximity, it's still far to walk! \n\nI realize I might b a bit of a hotel snob, but Bally's didn't cut it for me. I would never stay here again and you shouldn't either!"
1,"My home away from home. I first attended a concert at Amos' back in early 2009 and have been coming back at least once a year. They always book some of the best bands. The employees were also really friendly each time I have been, especially the bouncers. Its spacious and has a lot of history. I really hope this place never closes. Oh but if its your first time attending a show here, the whole parking situation might be confusing for you."
0,"The restaurant is about 15 miles from my house so I made a special trip to have breakfast Sunday morning, only to find a sign on their door saying NO GROUPONS accepted on weekends. Called Groupon and informed them the restaurant had taken it upon themselves to change the conditions of the Groupon. Groupon said they would reach out to the restaurant and have them contact me. They did not. Therefore, Groupon as a good honest customer orientated refunded my purchase price. So cant really comment on the food because I did not eat there and don't care to give my business to people who lie to me."
1,"We went to DW with friends for an early Valentine's day dinner. This was our first visit. My daughter recommended this place and we were not disappointed. It was so difficult to figure out what to order because everything sounded so good and looked so good going out!\n\nFirst I tried the strawberry infused rum which was delicious and not too sweet at all. I did also have the strawberry Caribbean mojito drink (can't remember what it is called). It was good but I thought it had too much mint and strawberry pulp.\n\nAt the table for appetizers we had jerk calamari (not what I expected, kind of sweet), flautas (excellent) and a chorizo and shrimp dish (also delicious).\n\nFor entrees I had the special which was a pan-fried skin-on snapper with coconut rice and mango salsa (out of this world), hubby had jerk lamb chops which he loved, most had the ox tails (got rave reviews as did the spicy mashed potatoes), shrimp scampi and chicken pasta. Not one bad review at all with entrees.\n\nWe shared a slice of carrot cake among the table and it was delicious. The server brought us a slice of the most chocolaty cake that I have ever had on the house as well.\n\nIt is a loooong way from our house but we will certainly go again. There are still things I want to try on the menu!"
1,"I booked this room (the Vdara suite specifically) for a bachelorette party with two other girls.  Never in my life would I had been able to afford this alone, but hey, when there's a bachelorette party you need to plan for, then you try to find the best...\n\nFirst of all, the place is freakin' HUGE!  I'm talking large bedroom, insanely large bathroom, huge dining room and living room.  As if that wasn't enough, they have a full refrigerator with an electric stove and plenty of cabinet space.  The only thing that's missing to this whole kitchenette experience is an oven, but hey, I certainly hope you don't expect to be waiting around all night for food to heat up in the oven.  And in case, let's say, you need a washer and dryer, well then, good thing you brought clothes cause they have that too!  There's even a half bathroom located next to the dining room, complete with toilet and sink (in case you don't have time to stumble into the other bathroom of course).  We had a total of 6 girls come up for dinner at the room, which we stocked in the fridge with PLENTY of alcohol!  The shower has a sit down area for those ladies (or guys too!) who want to shave their legs as well as two sinks, a separate bathtub, and plenty of towels!  We ordered more towels, though, and some more dishware, which was brought up promptly to our room.  \n\nMy only gripe is that there is no self parking for Vdara.  You have to park in Aria or simply valet your car in Vdara, which is easier.  This caused a little bit of confusion for a couple of friends, but once they got settled and saw the apartment like hotel, nothing else mattered except the PAR-TAY!\n\nOne other thing, the pool is amazing!  It's crowded by noon, but my friend and I awoke when the pool opened (9am) to enjoy the pool, which also had a hot tub!  It was nice to enjoy before the peeing children and their parents could make their way into swimsuits and make me cringe at the thought of even putting my feet into the pool.  Definitely give it a go if you find yourself awake early and sober!\n\nIt was worth every penny.   And yes, the hotel itself does connect  to the Bellagio hotel!  Um...more adventure, all right!"
1,"We loved the juicy, flavorful pastrami burger with onion rings so much that we went back a second time on our 5 day trip to Vegas.  The only reason I downgraded them a star was because my hubby ordered a Mai Tai and what he got was nothing like a Mai Tai.  We still drank it but we were disappointed.  Other than that, a very solid and fun Vegas dining experience."
0,"My Dad won a slot jackpot here twenty years ago so this place has a lot of nostalgic value for us.. We booked six rooms for my siblings, nephews, etc., to the tune of about $1400.00. \n\nWhen you book you think you're getting a four star hotel, then guess what? When you get there the fee you paid was for the old, Carson Tower.. (our room has crumbling popcorn ceilings (asbestos? I hope not) and without even a desk or fridge.. Decidedly two star. ) If you want the better four-star room, you have to pay an additional $19/ night. The old Bait and Switch.. very frustrating.. Good beds, though!\n\nIn our bathroom alone, the sink was cracked almost in half, the door levers are tarnished, toilet old and broken (a real chug-a-lug) and towels stained brown and threadbare. Unbelievable. When I called Roxanne, she was sorry about the sink but staunchly defended the hotel's four-star rating, saying three times it was rated by AAA, etc.. I guess a customer in a room's opinion doesn't matter.\n\nHousekeeping: 5 pm and when we got back to our room. no housekeeping service had been done, wet towels were still on floor.. I called Sharon in housekeeping and she had no reason for this and said she thought we had checked out. No, we're here two more days!! Then early one morning they're pounding at out door at the strike of 9 am. Isn't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in? Then they left no coffee cups.. The Keurig coffee cartridges cost $2.50 each (39 cents at Costco) so bring your own.\n\nPOOL: In the morning my friend and I wanted to sit at the pool and have a drink before exploring.. At 9:25 a.m. there was only about 30 people at the pool, but guess what? People have reserved for themselves every single chaise lounge (Approx. 200 or so of them)  by putting a book, hat, or towel from their room on them.. What about the morning guests? I found out later that they do this so they can try to sell day beds by the upper pool for $200 each. (You can stay three nights at the hotel for that amount!) Well it's a busy Sunday and they've only rented one (out of about twelve!) leaving lots of these huge beds wide open, while just one level below, dozens of people stand around chaise-less.. It's very sad, indeed..At 5 pm they let everyone and anyone into the pool area.. four gang members (and a baby) entered, who said they were from NW Vegas and took the four chaises next to us.. pants sagging low, throwing gang signs, we got a little nervous and left..\n\nWIFI:  the wifi in your room costs $12.99 per room/ per day/ PER DEVICE!! I am a normal, connected person with an iphone, ipad, macbook.. Those three devices (and my roommate's two) would have cost us $64.95 a day just for wifi! Does this seem fair?? (Roxanne the manager did help me out a bit on this issue, thanks so much!)\n\nIn the parking garage, the closest, premium parking spots are all empty and reserved for the managers, directors, etc.. making the paying customers park up a few levels. This is so they don't  have to use the garage elevators, one broken, the other slow and on it's last leg..We waited six minutes for the elevator (there's only six levels!!) It's not even check out time..\n\nBUFFET: The entrees, although salty, are actually quite tasty. But the desserts, which look great, are awful. The apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste. Everyone at my table was spitting out their desserts, not a pretty picture. If you have a larger group, there is a forced 18% gratuity that you have to pay in advance. I like to tip from my heart at the end of the meal.. those buffet workers really deserve it, though!\nFOOD: The Carson St. Cafe is decent, good breakfast.. great bread! My over-medium eggs had the white still raw, but the nice waiter replaced them along with some really nice fruit. Avoid the Asian Cuisine restaurant, my cashew chicken was something like $16.95 and was bland, tasted straight out of the Chun King can..\n\nThere are many nice employees here, but I was disappointed with our stay.."
0,"Honestly? I didn't care for this place. I get they're trying to be authentic to mexican style of ordering tacos, but we're in America, and it's confusing. \n\nI speak spanish and I asked for salsa, dude looked at me like I was an alien, they don't speak English so I don't know what was hard to understand.\n\nPrices are too high, flies, meh service, confusing setup. Needless to say we haven't been back."
0,"Did not come in here with high expectations and I was right. Ordered the mac and cheese sticks and the BBQ bacon burger. Nothing tasted fresh. The mac and cheese sticks were overbreaded and lacked flavor. The burger was big but did not stand out to me. Tasted like a burger I could get in any diner across America. Service was friendly, but slow. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I like the concept of the restaurant (has some cool Soviet graphics) and the food is edible. This may also be one of the better spots in Harrahs. This is Vegas after all though, and you can definitely find something more special elsewhere."
0,"We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night. \n\nThe place looked very promising with its modern indoor/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable. \n\nDuring our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options. \n\nWith pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes. \n\nThe pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps. \n\nThe flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries. \n\nA bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh. \n\nBy the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed. \n\nMaybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer. \n\nOn the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room. \n\nNormally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something."
0,"After also waiting for this place to open I came for lunch, mind you there were only about 3 tables seated during the time. It was all hype! \nThe food was mediocre: the meatballs were lukewarm, the baguettes were overly toasted that I couldn't bite down on them. The salads were decent but needed some salt. \nThe service itself was painfully slow. The food took 20-30 min to come out and we had a very simple order. When it came time to pay the servers didnt seem to be properly trained with the register system. It took, literally, 20 min to pay!! One of the managers decided to treat us to gelato while we waited for it to be situated. Once the checks came out they weren't even processed correctly. They should have just comped the entire meal, a measly $10 per person, instead of us waiting soooo long and not getting it right the first time. We ended up back at work late. Will most likely not be coming back...first impressions are everything."
0,"June 25, 2014: Normally this place has pretty good food. Their pretzels with cheese are really good. Today my work colleagues and I went to Pranksters for lunch. When we got there we immediately were overwhelmed by the smell of urinal cakes and raw sewage. It was overwhelming but when we asked the waitress about it, she said she didn't notice it.  Really?  I think she was instructed not to acknowledge it if customers were to ask about it. How could she NOT notice?\n\nUpdate: July 18: my co workers and I went back, expecting that the odor would be now resolved. No luck. We walked in, took one breath, and were hit with the exact same odor as 4 weeks prior. We turned around and got back in the car. A man, I presume was the manager, followed us outside and apologized and told us they had someone coming to address it later that day. \n\nI can't imagine going back again."

0,The prices are great but the wait is CRAZY just for picking up birth control that I called in on Monday it has taken me more than an hour. I finally got called but they can't find my pills I ordered four days ago.. Now I'm still waiting and I'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me. I should have known.. The first time I came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment.. That's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wIt time! :( the only person that could finally help me was Adrianna! Thank you!
1,The price was good for the strip and the location was centrally located. The free valet was a nice relief. The staff was friendly and the room was clean.\n\nDefinitely pay the extra money to upgrade and get a view of the strip and volcano from your room if you have the option!
0,"From 5 stars to 1 star within 24 hours.  Yesterday's dinner was a perfect experience with Cody our waiter who was a fantastic, professional server.   Tonight, a different waiter (older, with short grayish hair and glasses) who failed to introduce himself and gave off a harried and disinterested vibe.  Sure enough, the service was absolutely dreadful, just dreadful.  Never checked our table for silverware and my partner had to ask for a spoon when he brought coffee. Was in the middle of my appetizer salad when two entree plates get abruptly plopped on the table. The waiter became defensive when I commented it's proper to wait until the guest is done with the first course and I felt he was basically challenging my request.  Seriously, giving a customer a difficult time is a no-no, but not for this guy.  He is a representative for the restaurant and his was a pathetic display of ineptitude.  Shame on him."
1,"This school has been an amazing part of my daughters development!!!! We thank Roy, Kathy and the rest of the staff of CCM for all that you have done for us and Alessandra! I would hands down recommend this school to anyone!"
0,Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.
0,Bummer. I was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich. Stopped by Friday 7/27 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows.
1,"Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"
0,"Let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter, Sloan.\n\nMy friend and I came here for lunch one day, at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied. Let's get the pros out of the way, since there were only a few:\n\nPROS- We both got the veggie burger, which was fantastic. It is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple. PURPLE! And tastes great. For dessert we got the crepes (Nutella and Smores) and they too were very delicious. But, not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings.\n\nCONS- Who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs, and in such a way that even Janga would be shamed? Seriously, not only was there no room (and I cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there) but our table was lopsided, and kept rocking back and forth. The hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine. No. It was not.\n\nNext up prices; yeah whatever, it's expensive. I get that. 100$ for lunch for two.\n\nNow for the main one star review: Sloan, our waiter. Yeah, I remember his name. He was that bad. \nThe first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the person (who was not our waiter but some random chick) just dropped them off and ran away. Literally ran away. That's ok. Not like I was going to ask for ketchup. Oh wait, I was. So I waited for our actual waiter to come over so I could ask for some sauce. Ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and I started with \""Could I get some ranch....\"" and he turned to walk away. My friend had to yell 'wait' for him to return since she too wanted sauce.\nNext up, after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes, all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared. Not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off. \nFinally, the wait time for the check was ridiculous. Not only had we been there for an hour and half already, we had to wait even longer for Sloan to notice us.\n\nAnd where was Sloan this entire time? I shit you not, speaking to the bartender. THE ENTIRE TIME. Seriously? You only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day? \n\nMy friend had to wave him over to get a check, and even THEN we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- SINCE HE WAS RIGHT BACK WITH THE BARTENDER!\n\nNot one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there, but I never saw one, NOT ONE doing anything. Well, except for the only other waitress there, who was actually doing her job. But she was the only one.\n\nI don't ever expect to come back, at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on."
0,"I want to start by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Olive Garden.  It's truly one of my all-time favorites and usually my go-to Italian place when I want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.\n\nThat's why I was SOOOOOO disheartened by this particular location.  The waitress was awesome!!  Best part of the night.  BUT, the food was crap.  Seriously, I almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad.  I got the fetuccini alfredo.  The pasta was severely over cooked.  They noodles fell apart as I was trying to wind them around the fork to eat them.  And the sauce was poorly seasoned (like no flavor whatsoever) as well as chunky.  Have you ever had chunky alfredo sauce?  I was thinking, what the heck did they use in this, cottage cheese??  Ewwww!  That's all I have to say about that.  My dining partner said his noodles were also mushy (I thought, maybe, it was just the fetuccini, but nope).\n\nSave your money and eat somewhere else or go to a different Madison location because THIS one was so totally not worth it."
0,"Absolutely AWFUL service. \nWe were originally told a wait time of 40 minutes, and this progressively grew throughout our wait. So after about 45 minutes of waiting, we asked again how much longer of a wait. At this point, we were told it would be about another fifteen minutes. 25 minutes after THAT, we asked again and were told it would be another 10-15 minutes. \nAt this point, people that were JUST walking through the door were being told they had a 15 minute wait.... \nWAIT GUESS: 40 min\nWAIT TOTAL: about an hour and a half\n\nOn top of this, the lady who was at the front desk should not be a front of house person, on top of having seriously bad time guessing skills (which is part of her job), she had horrid customer service skills.  \n\nThe only positive was our waitress. She was great, very attentive!\n\nWhile I am usually a PF Changs fan, I would NEVER give my hard earned money to this poorly run establishment."
0,"Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal."
0,"Came into Vegas for business/and also to attend the SEMA show.  Our company decided to stay here.\n\nThe major complaints are as follows:\n\n1. the non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke.\n2. After my meetings - went back to the room to do some emails, and pull back the covers to the bed - only to find the bed was soaking wet with what I do not know!\nI called the front desk - and they apologized and said they would clear it up first thing in the morning.  You can imagine, how I feel after jumping into a bed that is soaked with the unimaginable!\n3. I ended up sleeping in the chair by my computer because they would not help me change rooms until the following morning!\nAll the Mandalay Bay could muster up was a big $50.00 credit (no new room) \n\nDo not bother with this hotel, with the way the economy is - all the other 4 and 5 star hotels in Vegas are so much better........with much better customer service.  Try Bellagio or Ceasars."
1,"The steak here was spectacular. I have to say that my NY was the best steak I have ever eaten. The sauce on it was light, a bit sticky and fantastic. The asparagus was in a sauce that was delightful. I have never tasted anything this good. The fries were excellent as well. The only downside here was the terrible service. Our waiter really tried hard. But it was obvious he had no training. There was no decorum or politeness to it. He did not remember who had ordered what. When the food came he was holding up plates asking who had what. Ugh. What has happened to fine dining. I must say that all restaurants at The Palms have good food and bad service actually. Except for Simon. How about a food server training Maloofs?"

0,"This is my 1st review and I'm taking it way back, over a year ago to our visit at Landry's. I had a gift card for this restaurant that I picked out as a reward from work. Came at lunch with my fam of 5, my parents and Aunty. \n\nFirst off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all. \n\nWorst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff. \n\nAnywho I just wanted to get this bad visit (service and food) off my chest. Unfortunately after all this time still not forgotten. Hopefully I can move on. Bad on me I didn't question the gift card issue more(although and at least we spoke to manager at the time). And demand a new soup for my dad. A bad but learning experience nonetheless."
0,"On one of our trips to Vegas we stayed at Excalibur and decided to try out the buffet because it was close and cheap...big mistake!\n\nThe food looked disgusting and tasted just ok. My boyfriend cracked a tooth with one of the ribs that was supposed to be boneless but wasn't.\n\nMy friend picked up two ice cream cones that looked like they had flies baked into the bottom. When we brought it to the attention of the attendants, they said it was from the cast iron forms they are cooked in, yeah right!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning here."
1,"Great place, finally a healthy juice in Vegas!!!! Definitely will visit again on my next trip to Vegas :)"
1,"Another place that sells snow shaved ice! They also sell various smoothies, and Vietnamese coffee drinks.\n\nWe decided to split a large size strawberry snow. Each snow comes with 2 free toppings, and if you want a glaze/sauce to go with it, it will be an extra charge.  The toppings include the \""popping boba\"" in multiple flavors, various flavors of mochi, fresh fruit, and chocolate chips just to name a few. Glaze/sauces included caramel, chocolate, condensed milk, and sesame. We decided to go with strawberries and coconut mochi as toppings, with chocolate sauce on top.\n\nThe large size came as a heaping pile of shaved ice, with a generous amount of toppings and sauce. It was large enough for 3 of us to share it. The snow itself is very fluffy and light, like Snoh in Phoenix's shaved ice. I do prefer Snoh's shaved ice a little better since theirs tastes a little lighter/fluffy snow-like.\n\nThis dessert shop is in the Mekong plaza shopping area in the food court. Our total for the large snow was a little over $6. Overall a good deal for your money!"
1,"I take the light rail into work every day, and have been wanting to stop at Sami's Gyros for a while now.  I finally got to!  yay!\n\nAnyways, I was on my way downtown to the baseball game and was starving.  I had busy Saturday morning, and didnt have time to stop beforehand to get some food.  So, I boarded the light rail early and decided to stop at Sami's to try it out.  I was glad I did.\n\nThis place was great.  They have a great menu, and prices are reasonable.  It was rather quiet on a Saturday afternoon, but I was also in there at 3:30 and they close at 4 on Saturdays, so most people had either already eaten.\n\nI got a Gyro, Greek salad and coke.  I think it cost me about $8.50, and it was more then enough for me.   Great serving size, I felt like I got what I paid for here, serving wise.  \n\nBUT, there were a few things on the Gyro that I noticed. I dont know if it was because I was there so close to closing time, or if this is the way that it always is, but the meat seemed a little dry to me.  I won't hold it against them, but it was probably becuase I was there so late.  Also, I wished they had put a little more of the sauce on the gyro.  I felt like that it was just not enough for me. \n\nI also like this place beause its right off the light rail at the Priest and Washington stop.  Easy on, easy off.  I do recomend this place.  The service was good and I enjoyed my time here."
1,"so its taste mtl week and i was looking for new places to try. places that had decently good reviews so this one caught my eye.\n\nRSVP is extremely easy with open table and a call back the morning of your reservation to confirm. easy as pie!\n\nbeautiful downstairs dining room with a bar overlooking the kitchen where you can enjoy watching cooks preparing the apps (and drool over some of them) or peak in the kitchen. there's a dining room upstairs too but i have no idea what it looks like.\n\nservice is attentive, waiters are extremely friendly and helpful. it wasn't rushed. after finishing my main, they didn't bring dessert out until i was ready which was like 10-12 minutes later.\n\nas for appetizer, i got the ostrich neck terrine with a foie gras surprise alongside some fresh greens, chopped chestnut, caramelized onions with slices of toasted baguette. it was definitely good with the many notes of flavor. it made me want more of it.\n\nfor main, it was the roasted salmon over a bed of cabbage, dulse gremolata and hareng-cini. the salmon was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and incredibly moist. 30-45 seconds less and it could be considered raw. the hareng-cini was crispy but lacked that something.\n\nand to finish it off, a chocolate caramel fleur de sel tart with confit butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (if i remember correctly). loved the squash and its accompanying sauce. enjoyed the caramel kick to the tart. as for the chocolate part, good but not rich enough.\n\nto accompany my main, i got their suggested wine that paired perfectly with the salmon.\n\nprice wise, with the glass of wine and after factoring in tips, you're looking in the neighborhood of $65. that's for their taste mtl menu. outside of that, expect to pay more.\n\nall in all, it was definitely good food that is perfectly cooked/prepared but it was missing that something. that je ne sais quoi that would definitely make you want to come back. i didn't get that feeling. instead, it was more of a \""i may consider this place if out with a bunch of friends looking for some french cuisine\""\n\nps. by sitting at the bar, i got a good look of the mackerel app with squid ink. it looks and sounds even better than the ostrich app"
0,"ok we were leaving on a sunday needed to go eat somewhere close the brunch was $45 dollars each I didn't know. neither did the couple ahead of us. they were shocked . ok we didn't know it was a champagne brunch until we saw others getting mimosas we ask for 2 we got 1 mimosa . they had food in little baskets the food was not good and there was maybe tri tip which is a cheap cut of meat  and maybe 3 types of sausage and one kind of potatoe. a brunch should have other lunch meats roast beef, ham and turkey and they had churros which is a type of sugar donut which looked good until you bite into it. it was hard not crispy and the inside was liquidy uncooked now this is a $45 brunch and you can't cook a churro correctly I did try another one it was uncooked inside as well. this is at ceasars casino which we had a bad stay during the week we should have known but who knew,my daughter had a good suggestion stay where you like the food it's true. where we liked the buffets the rooms we good or decent."
0,Too bad I can't give a -5 star. We were told that we can't eat there because we both have to order from the same restraunt(24/7 cafe is where I usually eat at.). I rarely every want asian food. The wife loves it. So we were really mad at them. This is all very sad because last time we ate there we spent almost $80 on us. Oh well their loss.
0,Food is good service sucks. Super slow! Not good for people who work here and have times breaks. I wish they would pick up speed. 15 mins for French fries is out of control. Get it together!!!! So I can enjoy your food.
0,"Frankensteins is always a 'last resort' type of place - where you go when every where else is too full or the queues too long. \n\nDuring the day, Frankenstiens poses as a gothic, Mary Shelly themed restaurant serving a range of basic and rather bland meals to students and tourists who fell for the Frankenstien gimmick. Student however, do have an excuse, this place is cheap - really cheap. \n\nIn the evenings, Frankensteins embraces the dark and becomes a bar. This really isnt a good thing, for while the gothic theme lends itself better to a bar than a restaurant, the atmosphere is still pretty dreadful and the whole thing feels like Frankenstein going for a jog - uncomfortable, dragging and groaning.  \n\nI dont like Frankenstiens that much, but it remains a faithful back up if the hundreds of other bars in Edinburgh close."
0,"No stars would be more like it. Management is BAD BAD BAD !!\nWe will NEVER return. \nI don't care how good the food is, BAD PEOPLE !!"
1,"I've eaten a lot of bbq in my life and this is the best I've tried here in Arizona.  For those who understand Texas bbq, this is the place to go.  The brisket was very tender, and I tried the corn souffle and slaw as well. Corn was incredible,  the slaw was. .. slaw.  it was a nice contrast to the rest of the food on the page though.  Service was very friendly,  Lynn was shooting the breeze with me about different bbq styles.  I came away feeling enlightened.  Mentally,  definitely not physically.  I had to undo the button on my pants after that meal.  All in all,  the decor could be better,  and it is in a strip mall,  but the food and  service make this a five star diamond in the rough."
1,"Ok...So I wanted to do something extra special for my husband for Valentine's Day. I went into this shop to chose the items for a gift basket. What was SO cool? I was able to choose a HUGE selection from Las Vegas Fruit & Nuts (and completely FILL a basket for under $50.00). I walked in the day they we roasting nuts...OMG, mouth watering! The gold dust popcorn is incredibly addictive and the dark chocolate covered almonds are so tasty. \nI am SO impressed with this company that I will be considering them first when I need another great basket. Lucky for me that my husband brought the basket home and I got to sample their fabulous wares! \nHighly recommended!"
1,"I'm a fan of all the clubs that are at the Wynn/Encore-- they just have a certain flair to them, of style and elegance, that other clubs seem to lack. And just like XS and Tryst, Surrender doesn't disappoint either. Called Surrender at night and Encore Beach Club during the day, which can be confusing at time. \n\nSurrender is primarily outdoors with a smaller indoor area where the DJ is usually set up. It gets crowded (like most clubs always do). But plenty of places to sit regardless if you have a table or not. 3 bars in all. and bathroom lines seem to always move at a nice place which is always nice for the ladies. \n\nYup, I'd say I'm a fan. Especially during the summer when they have their night time pool party on Thursday nights. Way too much fun!"
1,"quite the dive, obviously a local place to gamble, which is a great secret a tourist should not be privvy to. the max bet on a slot i was playing was 60-cents. c'mon, i've played that slot b4 at other casinos and the max bet was $3.00. definitely a favorite place to gamble."
1,"Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour."
0,"At first glance this restaurant appeared to be nice. But...\nOur guacamole appetizer and chips tasted fine but the top layer was brownish, as if it was not Freshly made and stored in the fridge for awhile. I ordered the napa salad, The shredded chicken taste rubbery so I put it aside and just ate the salad. My husband had the blackened ahi tuna salad which looked great, but later on the evening my husband was violently ill. Throwing up and diarrhea. I took him to the emergency room and they confirmed food poisoning. I called the restaurant to share the news as to warn them so someone else did not get sick. At first the manager seemed nice but upon his return phone call he made it very clear that \""it could not have been their food \"". Then continued to grill me with questions as to all the food that my husband ate. The next day we were rushed back to the hospital , with continued diarrhea and dehydration. The drs quickly confirmed an exotoxin that us found in tuna and other fish. Needless to say. We will not be visiting this restaurant again. Had the management been courteous and apologetic instead if rude and judgmental we might have given them a second chance. We definetly would order the ahi there EVER again !"
1,"Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.  The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience."
0,"Have you ever really wanted to eat in a sit down restaurant, but all that was anywhere near your house was one lousy place that was always over crowded, and the food was always pretty terrible?  If you have been missing out on this experience then I invite you to check out the Hickory Tavern in Wesley Chapel.  \n\nTonight, my girlfriend just got back from a conference in Vegas, and I am in the middle of a semester in college whilst working full time.  We are both overworked and tired, and just wanted some decent food without having to cook.  Unfortunately, all there is around here in the way of an American style sit down restaurant is Hickory Tavern.  Although we have consistently been disappointed with the HT's, some are more tolerable than others.  \n\nThe service is always slow, the places are always too crowded, and the parking just sucks all day long.  This one takes home the prize for all of those categories, and also adds bad food to the list.  Tonight we all ordered burgers with different sides, and different sauces for them, but I guess the staff elected to go with fries all around, and no sauces at all, ordered or not.  I like getting burgers at places because they are generally a safe bet, because how the HELL do you screw up a burger?  \n\nYou might start out by putting it on a soggy bun, and pairing it with soggy fries.  We could have maybe dipped the burger or the fries in the honey mustard or mexi ranch we ordered with our meals, but I guess they were out.  The soggy fry thing shouldn't have been an issue at all for my girlfriend because she ordered chips with her burger, but, like I said, I guess they were out. \n\nI skipped the salad I ordered because the burger looked good, and I didn't want to wait, but looks can be deceiving with Hickory Tavern food.  All in all, I think that was our last attempt with HT.  We don't like eating pizza or Chinese every time we want local food, but that is all that is decent around here.  We will probably become loyal patrons of literally anything that moves into the shopping center besides HT.  If any of either the parking, service, crowd, or food quality are better then it is bound to be better than Hickory Tavern at Wesley Chapel.\n\nAs for the bar experience, I haven't had it at this place yet, but judging by the crowd, if you are more than a one drink an hour person, you may just want to go to a Chili's or somewhere else.  I am not saying they are all this bad, but yes, they are all pretty lousy as a whole, and the odds are that if there is any other restaurant you can go to nearby an HT, it will turn out better.  Unfortunately that isn't the case around my house, but hopefully you all have more options."
0,"I've given this place a try several times, but I just can't seem to get a good meal out of there. I had their alfredo pasta and it had absolutely no flavor at all. It just lacks flavor, everything I order I feel like going back into the kitchen to add a little seasoning. There are plenty little Greek places around that serves up good home made food and for alot less $$ too, I wouldn't bother with this place again."
1,"Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria."
1,"After getting preggos, I was avoiding the whole foot massage experience just because...y'know, just because.  \n\nBut since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!\n\nFirst off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?\n\nIt was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  \n\nAs with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this \""flip over\"" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!\n\nOne of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!\n\nI definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)\n\nAt the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.\n\nThey also offer a Yelp discount too! \n\n4.5 stars.\n\n* Update! (09.20.11)\nGoing down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please.\n \nRight before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around."
0,"After visiting Vegas so many years I finally had the time to go and check out this place  with my family. Upon are arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile, and where told that we can sit our selfs any where we'd like. Once we sat our selfs we waited 10min!!! for anyone to acknowledge we were their. We got the attention of one of the many servers, We asked for a menu 5 min after asking she brought the menu. After that we never saw her again bad service weak attention to customer service It's very poor no floor manager presence, there's no sense of leadership."
1,This is never a bad spot no matter the time of day. Seriously.
0,"Cargo, \""cavernous cargo\"" I call it. I popped in a few days ago with some colleagues and had my ears blasted with hip hop, mainstream chart music, you name it the dj played it whilst also running a quiz.

1,"You can't really have too many complaints about Target. It is usually clean, the employees are friendly, and they have pretty much everything you want (albeit, they are more expensive than Wal-Mart and have a smaller selection of certain items). This Target is no exception. The quality of items, especially clothing, accessories, and shoes, tends to be higher than that of Wal-Mart as well.   Additionally, they have a grocery section in case you need to purchase food items. Because this Target is located in a large shopping center with a lot of other stores, sometimes parking is a bit difficult, but that is a small concern in the grand scheme of things."
1,"A fun stop on a Vegas excursion.  Staff was friendly and patient with a group of newbs.  I chose the glock, tommy gun, and desert eagle 50 cal.  Desert eagle is a monster.  A worthwhile stop when you're in vegas."
1,"What can I say? This is a true Vegas gem! \nNever had a bad experience here. \n$2 20oz beers, $1 during football games. \n$10 minimum purchase with card. \nHappy Hour menu is not shabby. \nYou'll meet lots of locals, and folks who are just passing by and overly excited for discovering Ellis. \n Karaoke after 9pm at the bar near the front entrance.  BBQ restaurant in the far back corner (not connected to the cafe) next to the Sport Bets. \nService is always fast and friendly! \n\nDouchy folks, STAY AWAY!"
0,Not very good
1,"From the apps to the desserts, I have not had a bad meal. Yes, you can find one in most major areas, but its good food. Why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals?"
1,"I can't imagine going to another salon ever.  I am a mature woman with many salon experiences under my belt, and from the time I step foot into this salon I knew this was the place for me. The salon is beautifully decorated and luxurious.   I had an appointment with Jamie, she spent time with me asking me questions and really getting to know what I wanted and what outcome I expected (that was a first for me), she colored and cut my long hair into a short bob that embraced my natural curls, so that I didn't have so much maintenance.  During my service, Donny brought me a Mimosa, and then coffee, what great service and my hair looked amazing the color was rich and the haircut perfect, (received many compliments from friends and family). \nThe service was amazing, the salon experience and ambiance superb.  When we take time to treat ourselves to salon services, you want to go to a salon like Platinum Entourage, where you get the whole package no matter what service you request.  Take advantage of the specials they have on blowouts.  Thanks Jamie, Todd, and Donny for giving me the royal treatment and making me look Amaaaazinggggggg"
1,This place is printing money and rightfully so. They simply do a bang up job. Best BBQ in AZ.
1,"John was awesome, very helpful, friendly and honest. Came out the next day. Affordable pricing, nothing shady. Thought my door was beyond repair, he literally brought it back to life. Would recommend to anyone who has a problem and thinks there is no hope."
0,"WORSE AIRLINES EVER. EVER! ... EVER!\n\nThey charge you for everything. Even the complementary peanuts you're suppose to get for free. Carry on is $50 so pack light guys. The inside of the place is disgustingly dirty. The seats are crammed so close together that even I can barely move and I'm 5 foot 100lbs! That's an exaggeration, I was able to move but barely. I  just cant imagine someone being comfortable sitting there. The person next to you is basically shoulder to shoulder with you. So hope the stranger next to you doesn't have a woundering head when they sleep. \n\nNow lets talk about punctuality. Spirit Airlines do not believe in arriving and leaving in a timely manner. It's not in their vocabulary. There is always something wrong. Always. \n\nOur flight from LV to Chicago had to do an emergency landing In Denver due to a cracked window. Let's just say, my group of friends slept on the airport floor, was fed with $7 food vouchers, endless waiting, after 20 hours stuck in Denver they put us on the same damn airplane with the cracked window! Went up in the air and went right back down. Wtf right. Arrived to Chicago with United airlines (waaay better). Leaving Chicago, we had to ride with Spirit again (not by choice already purchased ticket) & that will be the last damn time I will. Delayed due to the AC being broke. Surprise. The turbulence, I will never forget. I literally thought I was going to die. Like for real. Little kids in the back screaming, people barfing behind me. It was every airplane thriller movie I had seen brought to life! \n\nThey've contacted us trying to give us a $50 voucher to use with their airlines. Yah no thanks, I'd rather walk."
0,"I love giving great reviews... Sadly, we also have to be honest and give bad. Took some friends there today. Supposedly it was the \""hype\"" (sadly over).  Upon entry, the space was clean but crowd was more like gorillas hitting on helpless fawn. Yet the fawn were sitting on the bar. Not at, but ON. We sat outside (no hostess) so we just sat. Turns out there was a trainee/trainer for us. Neither had a clue as to \""gluten free\"" including the standard table chips and salsa. Ordered a blended marg (NO Blender, \""it broke\""). Tacos and salsa great!!!  beer was beer. food was served fast and warm. Again, love the food - def a 3-4.5 on food. But after 19 minutes, we still were not table touched by either the trainee or trainer. There was only 7 table occupied. SAD. but I guess when you hire looks over ability, we should not expect much. Then again, I should know better in the area it is located in. Now, I know El Hef opened not too long ago, but with Hi-FI (a newer more gorilla like venue) the crowd must must explore new territory. El Hefe is \""New kid on the block is now the red headed step child\"" But, give it 12 months and Hi-Fi will take that title. \n\nBack to point here. in short, if you are looking to be seen, go to either, maybe grab some food. If you are looking for a memorable experience of the good kind, there are 100 options within walking distance."
1,"I can truly say with out a doubt that I've NEVER had a bad experience at Sienna. Last week on Valentine's Day was the best. \n\nIt was my fifth experience at Sienna fourth for dinner. We were greeted with smiles from hostess and manager, Mike. Seated immediately and greeted again by, Matthew. \n\nFirst, I'd like to thank Chef Porco for hiring such an attentive, knowledgeable staff. Particularly, Matthew. His attention to detail of the menu was very impressive (and we love the French accent!). Our first order was an Italian Montepulciano for $40.\n\nWe decided on three courses...the anchovy crostini and the mussels arrabiata. Both very flavorful and yummy. I almost forgot about the homemade bread with white bean spread flavored with truffle and olive oil. Yummy!\n\nThe mesculan salad may seem simple but the kalamata olives, whipped goat cheese and red pepper vinaigrette just made it a much greater experience for the taste buds.\n\nIt was difficult to choose the last course. I'm a big fan of their meatballs and I knew I couldn't resist. So the Bucatini with their signature mozzarella stuff meatballs (size of baseballs) won! My sweetheart ordered my second choice, the Lamb Osso Buco...a large delectable portion of meat with mashed potatoes and carrots. As decent and fair minded Americans, we, of course, shared plates (thanks sweetie!). All courses were delicious and unique. The lamb tender, falling off bone. The meatballs melt in your mouth. We did not leave with a doggie bag.\n\nKudos to Sienna for your efforts to ensure that the service, food, and atmosphere is unique, fun, and delicious. I hope more restaurants can use you as a benchmark, particularly with service and knowledge of food and wine."
0,"Terrible service...  Do you ever go somewhere and just want to end it all while you sit at the table waiting??  Quite unfortunate, however I really have nothing else to say about this experience.  We did eventually get to order food, however no drinks which was quite bizarre till it was worked out.  \n\nWe also eventually saw some of the food...  Not 3/4's of it, given the service issues that I may have mentioned, but a few bites here and there.  Needless to say, we didn't actually eat the food, as it was time to take our business elsewhere.  \n\nGood luck with this place if you choice to waste your money here.  With so many other better options within a crawl, I don't understand how this place stays open... boo...."
1,Great place for drinks and happy hour.
1,"My family and I tried this place for the first time and we loved it!  The customer service was great!  The food was superb!  We tried their spicy chicken dish, kalbi ribs, and some type of beef dish and they were all tasty.  Their sides are home made, too, so that of course was good!  They are pretty affordable, too!  This is definitely the spot for late night dinner."
0,"After being advised by my son to NOT eat at Mickey's, I thought, \""well, how bad could it be for breakfast?\""  The answer: very bad.  This is a sleazy, greasy, dirty dinner frequented by people who are looking for only quantity because there is no quality.  The place, on a Thursday morning, was packed.  \n\nI ordered a cheese and bacon sandwich on toast.  The bacon had an \""off\"" flavor.  I don't know if it was rancid, but the bacon was awful.  I was done after one bite. \n\nMy sister ordered French Toast which means \""bread dipped in an egg/milk wash and fried on a griddle.  When it came, it looked like well-done scrambled eggs; no discernible pieces of bread found.   The  \""mass\"" covered the entire plate.  She said there was something wrong with the French toast; it had cinnamon and the bread was lumpy.  Then she tasted the raisin.  The waitress said this was \""Mickey's take on French toast.\""  She should have said, \""This was yesterday's cinnamon raisin roll that was recycled for the poor souls who want french toast.\""  After noting my sister was not happy with the cinnamon/raisin/egg much, she brought some regular toast as requested.  \n\nIf you like a quality breakfast in a clean restaurant, this is NOT the place for you. A Waffle House is much, much better.  I should have listened to my son.  Never again will I pass though this dump."
1,"My bf and I were in town for the weekend and had dinner here last Saturday. The place is small, but WOW is it delicious! I'm almost embarrassed to say we went back three more times before leaving town. The miso soup has a great home made taste, along with the special rolls (lion, amigo, caterpillar, what the heck, and a few more I can't remember :/) even the house salad was amazing. The prices are great, I've paid a lot more for sushi from the big chain sushi restaurants, and in no way do they compare to sushi house."
1,"One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life.\nBurger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious.\nThe Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!\n\nHighly, highly recommended."
0,"As with most businesses, there will be good and bad reviews, and hopefully I can come back at a later date to write a good one. However, my first experience with Gus' was quite negative.\nI ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again.\nOne of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be \""on its way\"" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice. \nNeedless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza.\nThink I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get."
0,"The decor is the best aspect.\n\nTERRIBLE service. The waiter could not show us on the wine list where anything was.  He did the fly by \""is everything ok\"" without stopping. One glass of wine i ordered was corked--but nothing from the waiter.\n\nWe ordered first soup, then appetizer, then our meal.\n\nThey rushed out the soup and appetizer together (this on a not busy night). We asked them to slow it down but apparently they don't know how. it felt like Applebees' services with higher priced food.\n\n\nThe food is not tapas--there is a very small appetizer menu. Of that the octopus was delicious, as was the onion soup.  the entrees were not at all memorable. We did not bother with dessert.\n\nEven had we decent service we felt like this is a restaurant trading on the chef's name with no hint of the august heritage. a misuse of a brand name chef--or an over extension of a name with one restaurant that does not meet the standards. This restaurant could not survive without the Hubert Keller name."
1,Very clean and comfy too. Woke up refreshed and smiling. Would stay here again in a heart beat. The freebies are AWESOME. Great food and drinks.
0,"Updated: Echo Canyon renovation. Echo Canyon used to be my favorite trail but after this new renovation it sucks.\n\nParking is worse than before if that's even possible. I went on a typical Thursday afternoon and the park rangers still had to turn people away. \n\nAs soon as you turn into the lot there is a barricade with a park ranger letting people in one at a time as soon as there is a spot available. This would be a good idea but the barricade is so close to the road that only about 5 cars can wait for a spot and not be blocking the main road.  This is very poor planning in my opinion.\n\nAs for the trail itself: they took out the stairs in the beginning and made it very steep with compressed gravel. This is actually harder than the stairs and I could definitely see people slipping off more easily.\n\nI would not bring anyone that is out of shape to this trail. Also our furry friends are no longer welcome (no dogs allowed).\n\nOnce you get past the parking and the \""improvements\"" to the  beginning of the trail, it is the old Echo Canyon that we all used to know and love."
0,Had my lashes taken off after having a Cleo done and only  1 fill. this place is unprofessional and a rip off! I wouldn't refer anyone here! Their lashes aren't even real mink! Waste of time and money! Shouldn't even get 1 star! Cherry lash lounge just lost a good customer! They say a fill in 2 weeks or less is just a regular fill and 2-3 is a fill plus. When I got my Cleo done no one informed me that I need to book a fill plus everytime even it's been 1 week  2 week or 3 weeks. If your going here to get a Cleo or want full lashes if most the lashes fall out by your next fill and your not scheduled for a fill plus your just sol and stuck w gaps between your lashes and barely any lashes even after fill. Even if it's the receptionist fault that your appointment wasn't booked right your still sol!They just wanna get people in and out and get there money. They don't care about customer service. So if u go here and aren't happy with your lashes at sum point they will do nothing! These people need to learn how to run a real business and not keep charging people for dumb stuff and rip them off!!! Look at sum of their reviews are only 1 stars due to them running a bad business! I had refered some of my girlfriends here that no longer will be going to cherry to get their lashes done.
0,"Growing up in high school, my friend Julia used to just rave about this place.  She swore the curry puffs were the best thing she'd ever put in her mouth.  She lived all the way across the city, though, so I never had the chance to sample it.  The last time she was in town, I went with her family.  I would have been less than impressed anyway, but it truly paled because I was expecting something spectacular both from her raves and the various awards it's received over the years.\n\nThe curry puffs were OK, but nothing great.  The rest of the dishes seemed like something I could get at any Chinese restaurant without the price tag that Cathay House put on them.  The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but the value wasn't there.  Wish I could have tried it 10 years ago."
0,"Be sure to take photos of your room before you leave, the added on a BS charge for two damaged room phones and a broken door lock.  $400 for two phones I didn't even touch. Ridiculous.  Never going back to any of the MGM Mirage Properties ever again."
1,"I love this hotel. I have stayed in several hotels in vegas and the venetian has become my favorite after my stay during this past summer. It was the week of EDC so the hotel was packed full of crazy people but I guess that's what added to the fun of this experience. My boyfriend and I came here with a group of friends not for EDC but just for the fun of vegas. \n\nOur room was amazing! We got placed on the 38th floor and I loved how the security personnel checks your key card before you're able to go up the elevators. It made me feel safe in a weird way haha. The first thing I saw when we opened our double doors was a baby grand piano, say whaaaat? Not only was there a giant piano in our living room but we also had a humongous I'd like to say 50-60 inch flat screen in the main room. There was a full dining table that seated 8 and our room came with a fridge, and a wine cooler. For the rooms we had 2 full king-size bedrooms each with walk in closets. Each room also had a 4 person jacuzzi hot tub, a stand up shower that had 2 shower heads with a gigantic bench inside it (I'm guessing it's meant for more than one person? lol) an in suite gym, and a dressing room with mirrors all around. We had 2 full bathrooms and one 1/2 of a bathroom. We had a fantastic view of the strip and the water show. We had some fun watching the people splash around obnoxiously down at TAO's pool party too. The bed's were so comfy that I had a hard time getting out of bed. \n\nFor the three nights we stayed at the venetian we found the service to be exceptional and by the push of a button we had a bell hop or hotel worker at our door within minutes. Room service was okay, though it's not quite up to par for the price they charge you. The casino's were awesome and I ended up winning $200 the first night woo! The venetian also has a little mall connected to it that's fun to shop. Most major designers (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada etc..) are available for your interest. There is a food court in the mall that kind of sucks but that isn't the venetian's fault. I recommend eating outside the hotel if you want good food. Come on, I mean, you ARE in vegas!!\n\nI had an amazing stay at the venetian and our suite felt like home and I definitely did not want to go back to Cali. I will be coming back in December and I can not wait!"
1,"I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended. \n\nStaff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always\nfriendly."
0,"Such a disappointment...... I stopped in today for an early dinner while visiting Scottsdale. I have tried Fleming's before and had solid meals.\n\nI ended up eating in the bar which almost requires a flashlight to see the menu. If the tv wasn't on, I would have needed my cell phone to see anything.\n\nThe service was fine. The bartender was attentive, nice.\n\nI ordered several apps. They all were sub par. The first was barely lukewarm. The second one, pork belly, had potential. You could tell part of the plate was put together and was waiting for the pork belly. I didn't want to tell the bartender they were 0 for 2. The calamari showed up. It was warm but very overcooked in a puddle of some sweet sauce.\n\nThe meal did fill me up but if i had to do it over again, I would try a different place.\n\nPlenty of parking outside.."
1,"First time here. Came here because I heard of the vegan options and its very near to my work.  I'm not a vegan, but its nice to go to places that have that option. They have vegetarian And Vegan options if that makes a difference for you.  They also have vegan pastries available.  From 5pm to 8pm they sell it for $1.\n\n People raved about the alien burrito so I had ordered that and couldn't resist having a frappe mint mocha.  As I wait for my food order the nice cashier came to my table to deliver my frappe .  \n\nI nearly drank all my mint mocha, it was delightful on this hot day.  Alien Burritto when I finally had it when I brought it to the office, it did not disappoint! Beans, quinoa, cheese, red bell peppers, lots of rolled lettuce. It was very flavorful without any meat!\n\nVery cozy atmosphere, it's the artsy coffee shop you usually would find in LA.\n\nSunset coffee you will see me again :)"
1,"I've seen Bobby Flay on the Foodnetwork, Iron Chef and countless cooking shows so eating at any of his restaurants is on my list of \""to-eats\"". When we went to Mesa, it was pretty empty when we stopped by for a late lunch but then again, it was during off-peak hours. There was only one other table of customers besides my husband and me. It was really overstaffed as there was at least twice as many service people as there were customers. \n\n-I ordered Ancho Chile Crusted Sea scallops on salad ($22) and husband had swordfish sandwich ($16). Both of our dishes were just ok. The sea scallops were undercooked and salad under it was just ok. Swordfish steak was thin and couldn't really taste any fish with all the other flavors going on with the club. \n-Our entrees were a 3* but I added 1* because the sides are the highlights: They serve a really nice selection of complimentary breads, chef gave us some butter pickles that there were totally mouth-watering. Southwestern fries that came with the swordfish club is so tasty. Fries are very crispy, not too thick and well-seasoned. Not too many places do fries to my liking. They also make excellent margaritas so that's a must. \n\nLunch prices are decent for the strip ranging from $15-$25 / entree."
1,"I must say that I have been blown head over heels with how Clayton and Jordan have impressed me the last few times I've come in to Jamba. First off, they're smiling as soon as I walk through the door. They have memorized my name as well as my entire favorite order!! Also, to top it off we have had some of the best morning conversations to start my day! Five stars guys!! You All Keep Me Coming Back! This is what great service is truly about"
1,"My dog is cuter than your dog. Seriously, there is no argument you can make to the contrary. He is simply the cutest dog in existence. Because of this, Buckley deserves the very best, so I constantly have my eye out for new shops to spoil him at. Today I came across Petique while waiting for my computer at the Apple store.\n\nThe deal is, The Biltmore donated the shop space to the Humane society.  The Humane Society in turn created a really cute little retail shop and adoption center. \n\nIf you have a small dog whom you enjoy carting around please check out the carriers here. They are some of the coolest I have seen in awhile (especially the sugar skull decorated one). \n\nI picked up a toy, some treats and poopy bags. The poopy bads are especially of note as they are decorated in a skull and cross bone pattern to let others know \""Don't eff with me while I am cleaning up my dog's poo\"".\n\nThey also had three or four dogs and a wall full of cats for adoption. The people were knowledgeable on the behavior of the dogs and when I inquired were able to tell me which they felt would and wouldn't be a good fit for the person I was inquiring for. \n\nThey do not have the biggest selection of products but what they do have is great and TAX FREE. Yup non-profits can do that. I'll be back to treat my pound puppy quite a bit I'd imagine."
0,"Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work."
1,"I like buffets.  I try to eat right for the most part so a buffet has become a much rarer thing for me but I still like them quite a bit.  I really do think this is the best out of the nine or so that I have tried in Las Vegas.  I think the best time to go would be on a Saturday and Sunday for brunch.  They have pretty great breakfast food, an omelet station, and as I'm sure others have mentioned, complimentary alcohol.  I really do think the food has a good quality to it, unlike many other buffets.  I like the idea of the pre-made salads rather than a salad bar.  The desserts are pretty spectacular for a buffet and there is a wide variety of them to choose from.  My wife is a big, big fan of the Bananas Foster/Crepe dessert and so am I.  They have raised their prices since I first went when they opened and the last two times they didn't even allow us to use our players card for $2 off.  Other than that, it's well worth it and this is the only buffet I go to."
0,We used to go to this restaurant all the time and used to love it. They recently changed owners and this places is not the same. The menu is different.  The drinks are not as good. The origin of the wines are no longer shown on the wine list. The prices are much higher. The place has lost its Spanish ambiance.  The little touches such as the shot of liquor at the end of the meal has been discarded. Would not be back again.
1,"I love buffets. Period. The only downside to my dinner visit was that I was already sort of full from a late lunch, which meant I couldn't fit much into my belly :( Sad, I know.\n\nSo my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.\n\nDessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed. Let's just say I did not touch that chocolate fountain.\n\nOther than that, I had a good dinner. Only wished I could fit more in my stomach :)"
0,"Gilbert, if you like a wine list of literally ten wines, a menu consisting of bread and bread byproducts, 40 year old Gilbert moms trying to look cool, and whiffing the smell of a far greater restaurant next door i.e. Liberty Market or Joe's, then Postino East is the way to go.\n\nI heard of Postino while reading another great issue of Phoenix Magazine while getting my hair trimmed at Great Clips. Hmm I said. This restaurant sounds intriguing.\n\nMaking my way to the Gotham City of the desert, Gilbert, i maneuvered my Mini Cooper through the thriving metropolis, and parked in one of Postino's well graveled parking spots.\n\nIt was then I entered Gilbert's version of a wine cafe. When I drink wine at a wine bar I expect it to taste like the nectar of the gods, unfortunately at Postino's this isn't the case. Their wine list is less insignificant then Tim Meadows's career. With so little to choose from I ended up ordering a wine I've never tasted before; a risky proposition to be sure. My wine ended up tasting like the liquid equivalent of Journey without Steve Perry.\n\nAfter emptying the reminder of my wine in one of Postino's urinals, I decided to eat some food. I ordered the bruschetta sampler in which i get to pick out four different kinds of flour based goodness. The pesto salami was definitely my favorite; sort of like Michael Winslow being my favorite in the Police Academy films.\n\nThe atmosphere is interesting the say the least; if you enjoy looking at women with sun spots and 8 year old twins and the creepy men checking them out from across the room then this is your spot.\n\nI'll pass and stick with Joe's across the street."

1,Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.
0,"While the service at Tomo is normally horribly slow, the food is usually pretty good. However, the service degrades from horribly slow to downright miserable if you're using a Restaurants.com coupon.\n\nOn Saturday (the day before we went to Tomo to redeem the Restaurants.com coupon), we had lunch but did not use the coupon because it wasn't accepted on Friday or Saturday. We returned on Sunday to use the Restaurants.com coupon and ordered the exact same meals - there were literally no deviations from what we'd ordered just the day prior. This time (Sunday) we shared with the hostess before being seated that we were back and this time had a coupon to redeem. She said that was no problem. In the middle of our meal (and while we were eating), she asked for the coupon so she could \""validate\"" it. When we received the check we discovered that they had added charges including:\n - $1.00 for a lemon wedge\n - $1.00 for sesame seeds\n - $1.00 for Ponzu sauce\n - $2.00 for soy paper instead of seaweed\n - $2.00 for Miso soup that's included with the meal\n - $2.00 for small house salad that's also supposed to be included in the meal\n - and more\n\nWhen we questioned the bill with someone who claimed to be the owner, he said he charged us for those items because we used the coupon and that he loses money on the Restaurants.com coupon program. We firmly told him that you can't change your prices and charge for items that are normally free without telling the customer and just putting it on the bill. He said he can do whatever he wants and that Restaurants.com says he can charge for everything and anything.\n\nThis is utterly ridiculous and completely unacceptable. I can guarantee that my family and I, as well as our friends and everyone I come in contact with, will never frequent Tomo in the future. And, if that's an example of the type of business Restaurants.com does business with and/or practices you permit, then we will never again do business with Restaurants.com, either."
1,"Best Chinese food in Tempe, no questions asked. I haven't had anything from there I didn't like. Also, in ordering from GrubHub one night, they messed up my order (which happens) and I called to complain.... tonight my order came with the dish they messed up. The note read - \""for free, because of last time.\"" I didn't even have to mention it. Can't beat service like that either!"
0,"Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!"
1,"Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!"
1,"This is a very good steak house just off the strip. Great ambiance. Amazing number of wait staff. Attentive but not excessive. \n\nMy colleague and I both started with the special salad of the night and it was excellent! A chopped salad with a creamy basil dressing. With the bread it could have been a meal in itself.  \n\nFor dinner I had the crab cakes which I was told was their most popular item. They were also excellent, two large mounds of crab with just enough filler to hold them together served with a spicy sauce. My colleague had the filet and it was good but not as tender as one would expect.\n\nFor dessert I had the banana bread pudding and it was very good. Big enough to share. More cake-like than a traditional bread pudding.\n\nLike all high end Vegas steak houses this place is expensive, maybe a bit too expensive. In this price range you can do a bit better even in Vegas. So overall I give it four stars."
0,"Some things are better in theory than in practice, and so it was with the burger I had at Cowbell. \n\nBut first, the good:  great atmosphere. Much better than its predecessor burger joint, Nix. Clean, inviting, great for watching sports. \n\nThe service was also great, if not overeager. I had no less than three people waiting on lil ole me, and it got kind of confusing. When they dropped the check off, I was taking my time (it wasn't busy, so I wasn't tying up a table or anything) and one of my army of servers came over to take it up before I even had a chance to put my credit card down. \n\nThe bad:  the side I had. The cucumber salad. Since cucumber salad is the new, hip-happenin side du jour, I'd like to ask all the burger joints to have a sit down and decide how it should be made. \n\nThis one was not good. The cucumbers had some weird sweet taste to them. And the vast majority of the cucumber salad was not, in fact, cucumber - it was raw onion. Ack. Go for some other side.\n\nThe ugly:  the burger. I'm sorry to have to say that. I wanted to like it -- I really did.  I had The Bruiser, a blackened patty with mushrooms, horseradish sauce, onions, lettuce and blue cheese. Sounds yum, right?\n\nBut noooooo. First there was so much blue cheese on it, it killed the rest of the flavors. But just to make sure I had no possible chance of tasting the meat, they doused the burger with about a gallon of horseradish sauce. It came gushing out the sides and it was clear from the get-go that I was going to need to eat this puppy with a fork (or a hazmat suit).  The onion kaiser bun was DOA from all that goo. \n\nThere's also the issue of \""blackening.\"" Normally this means a little spiciness. Perhaps it was the killer cloaking combo of blue cheese and horseradish, but I'm thinking that the blackening spice used here was... salt. Blech.\n\nFinally, I ordered the burger medium. It came out overdone. And I'm not convinced the meat quality was all that good either based on what I could see after I used a trowel to scrape all the crap off the burger. \n\nIt makes me sad that a cow gave her all for that travesty of a burger. Seriously - a huge disappointment. \n\nI'd go back if my dinner companion insisted, but I'd definitely go for a much, much simpler burger or something else altogether. But what's the point of going to a burger joint if the burgers aren't up to snuff?"
1,awesome people working there that really know their stuff. Great selection of guns. WE LOVE ARIZONA TACTICAL FIREARMS
0,Cupcakes were decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet. I may return but it will only be to try the macaroons.
1,"I tried this place out with a friend because I heard they had AWESOME red velvet waffles! unfortunately we came to late for the waffles BUT we tried other menu items such as there fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese , chicken loli-pops , and chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries EVERYTHING WAS PHENOMENAL! the whole time I was eating I was thinking I cant wait to yelp about this food! Im already making plans to try this restaurant again in the very near future! take it from me try this place out you wont be disappointed =)"
1,"ok -- so it's a dealership service center right?  just a GM corner of the world to take your money and leave you 'needing more' (more money or more repairs) ....right??   NOPE!  \n\nLund has always taken GREAT care of  my car. I have a little Saab and well, truth be told, it's needed a few repairs, one being pretty significant ....regardless i still LOVE MY SAAB!  \n\nEach time I have taken my car in, the service writers (Phil / Steve) have been GREAT!  They are helpful and know the vehicle -- they always makes sure i'm in/out of there as promised.   Their estimates are fair (i've compared them with others!!) and actually Lund tends to come in even less than they originally quoted.  Not sure about you but i'd rather be happily surprised with a smaller bill.\n\nWhen I pick up my car, I get a very detailed walk through of what they serviced, what i need to look out for, etc.  I also always return home in a very well cleaned car!  (nice little perk!) \n\nPrior to the economic bust - they gave me a free rental car each visit (all varieties of Saabs and even a CTS). That totally ROCKED ...but now, they only have the van service, which is still good - prompt, clean and courteous. \n\nThe waiting area has a variety of drinks/ snacks and tv / magazines to keep you entertained. Not the crazy \""spa, movie theater, yoga, tech center\"" auto mall thing --but it serves me just fine!!  Always a danish or a bagel to be had -- even cookies / ice cream and pop corn !!! (ohhh it's a party over there!!)  hehehe \nbut seriously, i don't need to have my car repair bill to be more expensive so it can cover the yoga instructor or the spa service expenses -- i just want my car taken care of.\n\nMaybe it's a Cadillac Hummer Saab thing - but  I am a LOYAL LUND fan!  \njust sayin"
0,"I am really confused by the behavior of the employees at this store, specifically a woman named Elyse.  Every single experience I have ever had with her is terrible.  If you hate your job as much as it seems you do- find a new one.  You have a very stress free job- collect shipments, run a cash register, hand off packages to the real hard working UPS employees (the drivers) and collect a paycheck.  With her unprofessional, rude and condescending attitude I will be happy to make my business to the new FedEx just down the road."
1,"Friendly service and a good place for a burger, thumbs up!"
0,"DON'T BRING CHILDREN TO THIS LOCATION!!! I brought my very nervous six-year old daughter here. She even told the phlebotomist she was scared, but there were no words of reassurance from the staff. The phlebotomist didn't really say much to us at all except to ask if my daughter would like to sit on my lap, which she said \""no.\"" As soon as the needle was inserted, my daughter jerked back, and blood was everywhere. My daughter was hysterically sobbing as I was then reprimanded by phlebotomist for not having her sit on my lap. (I wouldn't have minded doing that, but she made it sound optional rather than critical when she asked earlier. If she had warned me this might happen, I would have gladly sat with her.) Again, there were no words to calm my daughter down or even a \""sorry.\"" She asked if we wanted to draw the sample on the other arm since we had collected no blood at this point. Meanwhile, my daughter is so hysterical there was no way I could have her work on the other arm. The phlebotomist made me feel like I was in the way and should get moving out of the office if I wasn't going to do the other arm. My daughter hyperventilated practically the whole 15 minute drive home, crying that she never wants to get blood taken ever again. In my opinion, the staff should be coached and trained on how to handle nervous children or even calm down someone who is upset. I felt like I had no empathy at all, and now I have to worry about my daughter having permanent phobias with needles. I'm never coming here again!"
0,"Skyline lofts is a great building with some cool features; however, the management of the complex is unprofessional in their business tactics.  I greatly enjoyed the complex under Mark Taylor, but as soon as Weidner Properties took over the building, the professionalism of Mark Taylor went out the door.  It took days to get items fixed while living there; however, it took them no time to do an invasive walk through the week before we moved from the complex.  In the walk through, the managing director told us that the paint was not the special order paint they use to paint and therefore they would be charging us to repaint the moonlight white with the \""Weidner\"" moonlight white color.  They offered to sell us the paint and we could paint it to cut costs, which I jumped at.  For a second time in a week I repainted the rooms and hall to their specifications with three coats only to then again be charged an additional $200 at move out for painting.  In addition, the complex will charge you tax, administration fees, and cleaning costs that are more expensive than the professional maid services we have always used.  These charges are present no matter how much you leave the property in good condition.   To prevent you from contesting the charges, they give you 10 days to pay the charges or they send it to collections, even though the mailed letter with the charges took 4 to 5 business days to reach me through standard mail.  The short payment time is unprofessionally done purposely to prevent you from contesting these fees.  In other words, your money will not go far will living here with the service you get, but complex management will do everything they can to nickel and dime you when they get the chance.  \n\nWith the recent expansion, growth, and other options in downtown Phoenix, I seriously recommend looking at other complexes until Weidner reevaluates how they run their properties.  Hope this helps those looking into Skyline Lofts."
1,"So... I've never been here! Haha. I came here with my family for out Vegas trip and boy was it a huge place! M&M everywhere,. There wasn't a single space in the building that was not decked out with M&Ms. And since my niece and  younger brother are in LOVE with m&ms, they wen't super gaga! Running everywhere and getting all excited. My little brother even followed the M&M guy who walks around the store waving at people. It was so cute. It's a great store. Come check it out sometime when you're in Vegas,"

0,"We LOVE Stone and Vine and frequent it almost every week, which is why when the owners opened this restaurant , we were excited to give it a try.   We have tried it three times.  All three times the service was subpar.   It was a like committing a crime to get chips and salsa.  When we got them, we were pleased but only to find out tue extra salsa cost extra.   We are ok with that but it is courteous to let the table know    \n\nWe stopped ordering Margaritas the first night we stopped in.  Just could not get them right. \n\nAfter the third try with no improvement on overall service and difficulty in getting chips and salsa, we have given up.  We will stick with Stone and Vine."
0,"So let me explain . . . \n\nLynn & I are once again in Las Vegas for et another DUI conference.  I know, I know -- it's either Vegas or New Orleans, but hey! both cities know how to drink!  Anyway, after several nights of excellent but \""fancy\"" food, we were thinking something light and Japanese came to mind.  The problem is, we're staying at the Death Ray -- sorry, the Vdara -- and there are no restaurants per se in the hotel, and the Japanese restaurants nearby in the Bellagio or the Aria don't open until dinner.  BUT . . . there is this place called \""Social Hall\"" that opens at 1:00 pm on Friday, so --\n\nNow 1:00 in the afternoon is a DIFFERENT CLIENTELE than a nightclub/bar/restaurant into the evening . . . all we really wanted was some lunch.  So readers would be well advised to a) take this review with a grain of salt, and b) understand it is a review of this establishment for LUNCH, in contrast to the overwhelming number of other reviews in which more sensible Yelpers than I went during the evening hours.\n\nNo complaints about the food.  It wasn't a \""Wow!\"" but we sort of weren't expecting it to be.  The kitchen was out of some things -- I guess they weren't expecting people to eat lunch (but then why open for lunch?), as we were repeated told that a particular dish \""isn't ready yet.  It will be ready for dinner.\""  Uh, OK, but why open of lunch?  The Bento box was fine; the sushi was good.  But overall it seemed to lack that certain *spark* that elevates it above the ordinary.  \n\nThe waitress was simply not interested in us or in our needs.  Water glasses went unfilled.  She never asked us if we wanted to order more sake.  And it took forever to get the check.\n\nAnd the pulsating techno music at 1:00 in the afternoon gets tiresome by about 1:10.\n\nHOWEVER . . . in a move that is VERY unusual for Las Vegas, someone in this place truly cares about coffee!  They have a beautiful Hario siphon setup, complete with halogen heaters, plus a La Marzocco 3-group Linea and three Mazzer grinders for espresso.  The Ethipoian Harrar siphon coffee we enjoyed was superb!  Bonus points for that alone!  \n\nIf I were here for dinner, or if I were clubbing, well, I can certainly understand this place getting 4+ stars in reviews.  But I will probably take a pass on this place for lunch . . . unless it's just to duck in for some truly wonderful coffee."
0,I have been trying to sign up for about 1 week now!!! No one knows anything about discounted fees with your health insurance plan. UnitedHealth care offers a discount  for a gym membership. Golds being one of them. I printed the form and staff knows NOTHING!!! I also called UnitedHealth care just to make sure and yes we do get a discount. I also sent an email to golds headquarters NO REPLY
0,"Went for fathers day and quite frankly I think Beau is starting to lose his touch.  Nothing ever changes, Its always the same over the past two years. If anything lesser selections  of  meat and miniscule desserts.  Our waiter didnt listen to us, this is the second time with this guy,  I will never use him again. They stuck us in the back room and place was half full, I hate a 5* place with no table cloths, of course the other side does. The wine list is only fair.   Pork chop was dry, margarita was not made properly. When I asked him for just a little more tequila in the next he brings a double with still just a little tequila in it.  The evening was basically a lost experience.At these prices looks like more Binks, Christophers, Mission, Vincents, Petite Maison"
0,"Well, we have canceled our membership.  Their system was damaging our car.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which step was doing it, but a piece of trim that runs near the edge of the roof was pulled up and bent over after the last time we ran through their wash.  I don't think it was the heavy cloth strips they drag across the car because those would have been more likely to push it back down rather than peel it up.\n\nBut, whatever.  Never had this happen before, and not going to chance it again.  Of course they take no responsibility (no car wash does, to be fair).  I think \""touchless\"" is the only way to go.  And this place ain't touchless."
1,"So happy!  I went back to the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market on Sunday and noticed they had to change the layout.  Instead of being in the shape of the letter U, this  time there were so many new vendors, it was more like the letter E with a couple of side aisles.  There is now a guy with cheesekurds, fresh toffee, and still the delicious tamales, greek food, hummus and pita chips, a few different produce stands, coffee, etc.  Also, the \""crepe guy,\"" as I liked to call him, had BBQ Beef Sandwiches that day.  I guess he does more the crepes . . . who knew!?  I guess I'll have to stop calling him \""crepe guy\"" and start referring to the \""Truckin' Good Food\"" stand!

1,"I had family in town during restaurant week and my mom suggested we try Malabar because the menu for restaurant week provided a lot of choices. \nEverything we ate was delicious. In particular the croquetas and gambas al ajillo from the tapas menu were bigger than I expected. \nFor entrees our party of 4 tried 3 of the 5 offerings: Suquet de Mariscos, Albondigas con arroz, Mixed grill. Everything was delicious. The rice almost out-shined the albondigas. Definitely inspired me to return to try their paella. \nDesserts were good- light but sweet- however, definitely not as memorable as the tapas and platos. \nMusic was not too loud and well-selected, playing one of my favorites from Barcelona, who had just been to CLT recently, Jarabe de Palo. \nBeer selection also included a little taste of Catalu\u00f1a including the more difficult to find in the States, Estrella Damm. \nTo sum up, the food and drinks (including an affordable wine selection by glass) would definitely bring me back for a second try. \nMy only negative, which may speak more to restaurant week than to Malabar, was that I did feel rushed. There definitely wasn't \""sobremesa\"" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so. At one point the waitress tried to take my plate with my pan con tomate (which we ordered extra off the regular menu and was worth it) even before I was finished and my sangria glass when I still had some left in my glass. Not huge criticisms, but for me, one of the best parts of Spanish eating- besides the flavors- is the sharing and relaxing over delicious food without worry for time or pace. \nOverall it was a great meal."
0,"The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."
0,"This was probably the worse experience I have ever had at a Pakistani/Indian restaurant. There was one person there running the front. He didn't speak English. We were lost for about an hour and I had to call him three or more times because I just did not understand a word he said. I only picked up 'food maxx' and went to two different ones until I found it.  Ordering was not any easier. We just werent able to communicate properly. The food wasn't bad but defiantly could have been better. There was no complementary chutney, tea or anything. we asked for some, it was brought to us and then when receiving the reciept we realized we were charged for literally everything. The guy even miscounted the tea and charged us more than we had. We had asked for some water. The guy told us to get it ourselves. My sister told him, he's the waiter, he's supposed to bring us water. He laughed and went inside and brought us water. The guy gave us a hard time with everything we asked for until we just got up and got it ourselves with things such as napkins. They even had items on their menu that they didn't have.It was just a bad experience all together. Definitely don't recommend it to anyone."
1,"I found the shop through a Yelp! email on consignment stores. I love a good deal, but tend to stay away from consignment shops because most of the time you find a bunch of junk and one good find if any. After liking PLRG on Facebook and seeing their daily posts of their mannequin's featured outfits and just in items (like Tiffany & Co ring or Coach handbag) I finally ventured in to their Uptown Location. The shop was cute and clean and well stocked with locally made jewelry and fashionista finds. The lady behind the counter was not super friendly, but my experience was good enough to make me check out their Arcadia Location today. Both stores have great merchandise, but I did find more things to buy at the arcadia location and the staff was friendlier and offered opinions and could even tell me how nice the lady was who donated some of the items bought. I'll come back for sure, but if I could only come to one? I'd probably go Arcadia!"
0,"You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back."
0,"We looked at the food before deciding to sit down and it looked like it would be pretty good. Looks can be deceiving because NOTHING was good. I mean nothing -- usually there is at least one dish that you can eat to get your money's worth and there was literally nothing. The fried shrimp must have been over-fried by like 10 minutes it was so tough and chewy, the sweet and sour chicken had unidentifiable meat in it that was such a weird texture it made me gag. None of the meats were good, anything that was fish was too fishy, the rice and noodles were dried out. And everything smelled like old grease and had similar flavors. The soda pops we got also tasted \""off\"".  We were very disappointed for $50 as we left hungry and went to McDonald's.\n\nThe waitress was very nice, cleared dishes quickly and was very attentive.  She brought my son potatoes that were not on the buffet since we couldn't find anything he would eat, so the people are nice and I wish I could say something nice about the food but I can't."
0,"My boyfriend and I entered bachi burger with the thought of exotic flavors and delicious high-quality beef. Though the beef may have been exceptional, we both were disappointed with how overpowering the flavors were of everything else other than the beef. Cooked perfectly at medium, we would have liked the burger to not be completely overshadowed by what was an addition to it. \n\nHe got the Miyagi-San burger which tasted more like sushi than it did hamburger (and I took a bite of it!) I got the Ronin burger where I thought the Katsu BBQ sauce was way too sweet and made it hard to keep eating.\n\nCall me \""old-fashioned\"" or \""all-American\"" but I'll take a Great Burger where I taste the beef before these two options any day, \n\nFor $40 + dollars, we had two burgers, two sides of fries, a beer and a green tea. I hoped to actually enjoy my meal rather than us question to one another whether the burgers were worth even worth eating. \n\nWe found more enjoyment giggling over the green sunglasses with no lenses, neon orange shirt wearing hipster next to us than our food. I was so excited about this place. But it just wasn't good, in our opinion.\n\nWait... the fries were good! Two stars."
0,"Run don't walk AWAY from Dollar Rent A Car in Treasure Island! Starting with an hour wait to get service  ( with only three people in line) to them not knowing exactly which floor of the parking garage the car was on to the deceitful billing practices this company is shameful! \n\nTheir trick was to charge your for more than you had stated you wanted, then you look at a tiny screen(after waiting for an hour and on the verge of being late for a meeting) and hit agree. What we thought we were agreeing to was $150 but the billed totaled over $300 for 27 hours!\n\nWe had the same experience with the \""Free\"" GPS offer as another reviewer, which is not free at all.\n\nWe called customer service and tried to explain that we had not wanted all the add on coverage we were charged for and that we were told we would not be charged for a second day but just for three extra hours, but that was not what they billed for. They just stated that we had hit the \""I agree\"" button.\n\nWhat a horrible experience! I suppose they make their stock holder happy by robbing their customers but is that the kind of business that you want to support? Shame on you Dollar Rent A Car."
0,"I went here with a group of girls, late night, and wearing everyday jeans and t-shirts. The server was very nice, but the service sucked. Not to mention that they set him up with three tables at the same time. After we ordered our food, it took them over half an hour to get our food to us. Other tables were being served before us even though they got there after us with the same amount of people in their group. Not cool. \n\nThe food was good. The pasta salad was not so good.\n\nExperience it for yourself, but as for me and our group, we will not be going back. I think that I would rather get their to go before going back to the actual restaurant."
1,"Solid. Not out of this world, but Thai Taste is solid.  The prices are reasonable, and whenever I need my Pad See Ew fix, I'll head to TT.  There are restaurants light years better in Boston and Chicago, but for now, TT will do. \n\nThe ambiance is kind of old school, tables with plastic covers the random wood-carving, and a hammock hanging from the ceiling with a fake person napping inside.  It's not my favorite, but hey, it adds to the charm. \n\nSince this place has been reviewed so many times, I'll just give my 2-cent tip. Lunch specials are a great value.  For about $6 or $7 bucks, depending on the protein you pick, you'll get an entree (some with rice), a spring roll, soup and iced tea.  (Iced tea and soup not included if you get lunch special take out.) \n\nI've gotten the squash special, which is stir-fried yellow squash and protein of choice...that was an insane $12.95 by comparison.  (The dish itself was OK, not as flavorful as the Pad See Ew and the squash for some reason had a squeaky sound whenever I bit into them.) \n\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood joint where the service is good, and you will have a good meal.  Maybe not stellar, out-of-this-world great (like Paula Deen would say) but you'll leave happy and very full."
1,"Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \""gym\"" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone."
0,"My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge.  We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros.  We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor.  We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner.  The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.  The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat.  We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks.  The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time.  There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant.  Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back."
1,Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!
1,"Highly recommend this place and will be a town crier to elicit business. Finally great fare in our east valley neck of the woods! Run, go now for crazy good food.\nFarm to table salad was amazing and I will order this forevermore. I am eager to see what lands in this dish in autumn. The carribean jerked sea bass was a gastronomic symphony.  \nI may upgrade a star after our next visit. I was so excited about this place beforehand, I want to be objective!"
0,"What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  \n\nFirst off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  \nFinally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  \nThe rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  \nEverything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  \nWe had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  \nThe last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  \nMy korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  \nOverall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi."
1,"Customer Service = 5 out of 5 stars\nCleanliness = 5 out of 5 stars\nQuality of Food = 5 out of 5 stars\n\nFirst time experience was fantastic.\n\nThe bartender gave excellent recommendations and the food was definitely fusion inspired for sure. \n\nIn addition the dessert was top notch - I am not a big fan, but the suffle.\n\nThank you to Roy's staff for a 5 star experience.\n\n-Todd\nCustomer on 3/13/2011"
1,Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.
1,"I have a friend who has a story about looking for a bar in the Phx with her slightly flaky friend only to end up in someone's house that happened to have a neon \""open\"" sign in the window.  I'm kind of convinced that news of this story was the inspiration for the Lost Leaf at its new location.  It would be hard for you to convince me of anything less idiosyncratic.  They have a pretty rocking selection of bottled beers, interesting art displays, an awkwardly placed restroom which makes it pretty easy to mess with people (which is always fun), and it isn't too far from modified.  Crowded on FF's?  Oh hell yes.  And a fine place if you're going on a date and you're skeptical about it -- because at least you get to go to an awesome place.... which supports the dating philosophy I developed after meeting up with a dude who talked about his ferret a little too much:  Never go anywhere lame for a first date.  Because if the activity is lame and the dude (or lady as the case may be) is lame you will be out ten bucks for gas (in these parts) and MISERABLE.  Getting hit by a hail storm of women's shoes on the drive home should never be the only part of a date that you want to remember....but the shoe hailstorm is another story for another review...."
1,I like the #5..
0,"If I could give this bar no stars or half of one star, I would.  \n\nMy husband and I played video poker here for less than two hours on a Saturday afternoon (around 2:00 pm, when the bar was not busy), and we had THE WORST service we have ever experienced in Vegas from the bartender, Josh.  He was rude, offensive and extremely condescending.  When we sat down we both put $100 into the machines, and began playing the max bet, which was a requirement we both fully understood and were fine with to be able to comp our drinks.  Josh reminded us when he brought the first round that we could have one drink every 30 minutes, and that we needed to be playing the max bet.  Again, we were fine with that and it was not an issue.\n\nWe started playing and were winning.  After about 35 minutes or so we ordered our second round of drinks and Josh, who was busy making shots and espresso martinis for the two couples next to us (of whom only one person was playing the video poker machine occasionally but all four persons were receiving comped drinks), seemed annoyed.  He reluctantly brought us the drinks and then continued to ignore us and boast an air of arrogance to all of those around him.\n\nFinally, after another 35-40 minutes had gone by, we asked Josh for a final round of drinks, and he rudely told us that he had to ask his floor manager because he didn't know if we had played enough.  His comment was absurd and delivered in such a way that we could not have been more offended.  He did not adhere to this policy with any of the other players around us, so why we were singled out when we had been consistently gambling and did not ask for drinks before we knew 30+ minutes had passed just baffled us.  We were merely killing time before taking a limo to the airport, so his behavior was just absurd.\n\nAfter checking with his floor manager who informed him that we had been gambling enough and another drink was approved, he decided to tell us that before he could give us another drink we had been warned by him, and that \""his job was on the line.\""  We were LIVID.  My husband offered to pay for the drinks, and we left right away to speak with management about the treatment we had just received.  Upon asking to speak to the manager we were told to walk back to the Bar and that he/she would be there to talk to; however, no one was to be found.  We don't know if it was by the hand of Josh that this person never appeared, but it leaves us to conclude that this particular bar and this particular bartender are some of the worst in not just Vegas, but the US.  \n\nWe are huge fans of the Aria and were extremely disappointed in this service experience and the way it was handled afterwards.  We will seriously consider other casinos and hotels to stay at during our next trip to Vegas, even though we loved the Sky Suite and every other person at the hotel besides Josh."
1,"Ok, so after a few visits to this place, I figured it's time to update my review. \n\nI don't classify myself as a Sushi connoisseur by any stretch, so I would say that doesn't qualify me too well to review this for people who are.  With that said, if you are new to sushi, and want to find what you like, this place is a good choice.\n\nI only wish I could get s steak with my sushi.  And maybe a baked potato and a salad.  :)"
0,"This place is super sketchy! \n\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night."
1,"Love this place.  My lunch stop 2-3 days a week.  Chicken is moist and tender.  Could use more seasoning if eaten alone, but with the sauce it's awesome.  I love the amount of butter on the toast. The fries were good but nothing special.  They have the best tea around though.\n\nThe service is what's sets it apart for me.  Everyone was real friendly, courteous and professional.  The food came out hot and fast.  I'd eat here 5 days a week, but a man's gotta have his beef too."
0,"Until today, I've long considered these the best sliders in the Valley. My favorites have always been the Gourmet (Tenderloin) sliders and my friend and I each ordered them today with a side of fries from the lunch special menu.\n\nOn previous visits the buns were soft and buttery; the tenderloin was generous, moist and tender and we left happy.\n\nToday: buns are smaller and dry. Tenderloin appeared to be half the size of the old portions and came back dry and gray despite the fact that we requested medium-rare. I suspect that the meat was dry from age and not overcooking as it was barely marked from the hot grill. \n\nA few years ago at lunch there would be at least two servers and a bartender. Today, it was a sole bartender to handle the lunch \""rush\"" (two tables at noon). I fear that the ownership might be attacking declining profits by cutting back on food cost vs. focusing on building sales.\n\nWell, I won't be back anytime soon. There are better sliders elsewhere."
1,Great food. Outside heaters not working!!! Cold!!!
1,"I've glanced at Fishers so many times, but the menu has never really leapt out at me, until tonight. We were roaming around seeking inspiration for an impromptu meal out, and after a few lacklustre 'hmm I guess that would do...' menus, we came across Fishers, and both of us lit up. I tucked into the spiced aubergine soup (tasty and spicy, with nice texture from almond slices) and penang curry which was lovely and had the perfect level of spice for me. The pineapple chutney was fantastic, the fruity flavour cut nicely through the rich coconut. The SR had the deluxe fish and chips (fish and battered prawns), some fantastic looking chips. I didn't get a look in, but then again, neither did he, we both jealously guarded our plates. \n\nIt's not a 5 star, I did think the service was at times a little too hovery, and I was floored when I saw the price of the curry (\u00a320)... I am not 100% convinced that although it was lovely, it was \u00a320 lovely. But, saying that, I'd definitely recommend to others, and hope to return at some point as well."
0,"Oh goodness, where to start...\n\nThe rooms were updated and had a modern theme, but the parking structure was not updated and was as terrible as it used to be when it was Imperial Palace years ago.  Also, there were no clearly marked signs to the hotel entrance once you park in a tight space.  Best way to get in/out of the structure was through Koval.  In/out access during the evening is a bit frustrating.  There are \""traffic controllers\""  that have no idea how to direct traffic. \n\nUpon checking in at registration, it was a bit confusing, they didn't have those crowd/lane control poles; instead there was an actual person directing you to the next attendant.  \n\nWhen using the elevator, there is a security guard in a bright  neon vest that has to see your key card to confirm your are a hotel guest.  It's fine, but the process can be slow if there are lots of people waiting.  Other hotels require hotel guests to swipe their cards in the elevators as confirmation before pressing the floor numbers. \n\nOther reviewers mentioned hearing construction early in the morning.  We stayed (for 2 nights) on the 3rd floor, overlooking the pool renovation, so my fianc\u00e9 and I were a bit concerned.  The first morning we were startled by a loud noise coming from the room next door.  It sounded like someone was hanging something on the wall or what not.  The noise went on for 30 minutes and stopped.\n\nRandomness:  during the first night we stayed, we saw some vomit around the elevator threshold on the third floor.  By the time we left (2 days later), it was still there, but dried up.  Eww.\n\nWe only stayed here because it was close to the Mirage for a cheer competition we were in town for in December.  Our total cost was a little over $200, which is decent for being on the strip. \n\nPros: modern, comfy rooms with plenty of space and outlets. \n\nThere are clearly several areas that require improvement though.  Skipping this place next time."
0,"I received a response from William.  Apparently my first email went into his spam folder.  He is going to provide an email gift card for us to try the place out again.  I haven't received the card yet, but I think my husband and I will give it one more shot and see if things have improved."
0,"Probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  It was sickeningly sweet (tasted sweeter than my soda!), and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness.  The ground meat on the inside on the other hand, was very bland.  I thought when you had something as a \""special\"", such as the Friday stuffed cabbage, that meant it was supposed to be really good?  The overwhelming sweetness of the sauce made it very hard to eat.\n\nThe only redeeming factor in the meal was when I tried some of the Straw sandwich (pastrami, sauerkraut, swiss), which was decent, nothing spectacular, but a whole lot better than the stuffed cabbage.  At other delis I've been to, you can get a whole lot more meat, and more flavor for about the same price, so I will probably be skipping any future visits to this deli."
1,"Another place in town that I wish I'd known about a long time ago.\n\nThis place is great, though hidden away.  If you ask, no the meat is not organic or free-range.  But it's local and very fresh - one of my friends said they got a piece that was still warm.\n\nThey also have some cuts of meat you won't see in the grocery stores - like beef hearts.  I went in today to buy a chicken and there were a couple pig heads sitting in trays, ready to go home - so, if you are an adventurous cook, this might be a good place to check out.\n\nWhat they actually have varies from day to day but I can generally find something I'd like to cook with, and they generally have a mixture of beef, pork, chicken, eggs, and slightly more processed stuff like meat sticks, ham, bacon, bacon ends, jerky and sausages.  Some of these (like the smoked pork chops and the ham) are a little salty for my taste, but they are still pretty good and the prices are very reasonable.  \n\nI got some prime rib here for my girlfriend and I to have as a treat and it was excellent, extremely delicious and flavorful.  Basically I am going to try and buy as much as possible of of my weekly meat here, instead of at the grocery store."
0,"Food: Dark Chocolate Fondue for four. One item, gummi bears is substituted for red velvet cake without any notice.  Note, there is a huge candy store in the same space that had plenty of gummi bears.\n\nServer: Alicia\n\nDrinks: Water and raspberry hot chocolate. We ordered a half-bottle of champagne, and were told that they were out an hour after we ordered.  Imagine our surprise when it was still on the bill.  \n\nTo say we were unimpressed by the lack of service and the lack of communication from our server is an understatement.  Do yourself a favor, and just don't do it."
0,"In my opinion this hotel/casino is over-rated.  We stayed at the Cosmopolitan for about the same price and were on the 65th floor overlooking the Bellagio's fountains.  At the Bellagio we overlooked the pool.\n\nThe pool is nice and huge.\n\nThe carpet, decor and furnishings are all old and dated."
1,"After my nightmarish evening at the Plaza Hotel and Casino (see my review of that fleabag!) I checked into the Golden Nugget, and couldn't have been more happy. For about $15 more a night, the difference was staggering! \n\nFirst, the casino, lobby and elevators have been beautifully restored, and are clean and fresh smelling. The check-in staff was not overtly friendly, but still very polite and respectful. The offer of bellboy service was made, but in the age of rolling luggage, who needs that!\n\nI wasn't expecting much from my Gold Tower room, but was delighted to see how spacious and luxurious it was! Amazingly comfortable bed, nice furniture, giant flat-panel television, mini-safe for valuables, etc. The entry area was marbled, with the balance of the room carpeted. Everything was immaculately clean, and the room was fresh smelling but not laden with cleaning chemicals or disinfectant. The bathroom was smallish (hey, this is a very old building) but again, it was beautifully restored...marble tile, elegant sink/counter, shower with curved curtain rod and great water pressure, etc. The commode seemed to be rocket powered! WiFi internet access was a bit pricey at $12.95 a day, but it worked well and was very speedy. Now none of this was a fluke, as each of my three friends had rooms that were virtually identical.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about the room, it would be that sound isolation is not terribly good. It's not that I could hear people through the walls, but sounds in the hallway (doors slamming, people walking, etc.) definitely seemed quite loud. Again, this probably just goes with the territory in an older building. No big deal.\n\nThat evening my friends and I took a quick dip in the pool, and had fun swimming up within inches of the giant fish and sharks in the central aquarium. It was fascinating to be so close to these beautiful animals. Afterwards we soaked in the jacuzzi for an hour or so, to unwind before going out to dinner. The pool staff was attentive and helpful...lots of clean, high quality towels were provided, and the wait staff was quick to bring drinks around.\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time in two Nugget bars, I wish I could remember the name of them. The first has a large balcony that hangs out over Fremont Street, and it's a great spot to do a little \""people watching.\"" The second is a circular arrangement with the bar in the middle, and it had the most amazing band playing there. Just four piece (guitar, keyboardist/vocalist, drums, bass) but they sounded huge, their level of musicianship was tremendous and the singer really knew how to work a crowd.\n\nHonestly, I had no idea that downtown Vegas had a hotel of this caliber! When traveling for work, I usually stay at the Bellagio. Now the Nugget is no Bellagio, but you know what...it's really not too far behind! Anyhow, I definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who wishes to enjoy the \""old school\"" Fremont Street scene."
1,Chef John sucks at everything. Luckily for him Anna is a great bartender and is super hot.
1,"Babbo is one of our favorite restaurants in the Valley. We have always had attentive servers and an enjoyable experience and we have frequented the Surprise location about once a week for 2 years now. They have an extensive, creative and delicious menu. I have tried 2/3 of the menu because every item can be made vegetarian. You can also substitute whole grain pasta, which is just as fabulous. My favorite meals are the Pear Gorgonzola Pizza, Sun Dried Tomato, Mushroom and Asparagus Pasta, and the new Brussels Sprouts Pasta, which is amazing even without the meat item that usually comes in it. My family loves the Curry Chicken Pear Pasta and Alfredo and of course the seasoned bread that accompanies the meal."
1,"Decided to check this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp. It was really easy to find on the outside corner of the Paris Hotel. We got there around 3pm for a late lunch and didn't have to wait. Our server was really great and offered a lot of good suggestions, some of which we decided to try.\n\nUpon her recommendation I ordered the turkey and brie crepe since it seemed like something you don't see on an everyday menu. It looks small when you get it, but it was very rich and filling and I didn't even finish it even though I was sooooo hungry. The arugula salad they put on the top balances the richness of the cheese out nice, so overall I thought it was a very simple, yet sophisticated dish. My friend had ordered the grilled chicken and spinach crepe and it was tasty too. \n\nAgain, on our waitresses recommendation, we decided to share the vanilla creme brulee and raspberry crepe for dessert. I wasn't too blown away by this dessert and felt it sounded better on paper than it did on my palette. The raspberry sorbet I felt was the best part, but the vanilla creme in the crepe wasn't to my liking. \n\nI also ordered the Sugar Factory Cappuccino, which is made with white chocolate, and it was huuuugggee! It was sooo delicious though and I was sad I was so full I couldn't finish it. I would come back just for this.\n\nOverall, I think they have an amazing selection of desserts, it was just so hard to decide. I would definitely want to come back just to try some of the other things on the menu. \n\nThe candy shop next door also awesome with a lot of cute candies, clothing and miscellaneous stuff with the cute Sugar Factory logo."
1,"I. Am. A. Fan. This place is so much fun! The friends I was with had all been to the Hofbrauhaus before, so I was the only one who didn't know what to expect. We made a reservation for 8:30 on a saturday and walked right in when we arrived.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the HIIIIIGH ceilings and how loud it is. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.\n\nBut this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.\n\nThe prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.\n\nAnyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!"
1,ABSOLUTE FAVORITE STEAK HOUSE OF ALL TIME!\nAmazing steaks! Extremly intresting and delicious appetizers and desserts!\nVERY EXPENSIVE!
0,Seems like every time we go to this branch there is 5-10 people in line and only two tellers. (Which is not too bad because lets face it BoA stock has dropped from $54.85 to $16.64 so you might expect a little penny pinching.) However there is no excuse for tellers to be so busy and have one or two supervisors wandering the floor shuffling papers and fooling with computer tablets. This one clown actually went to every person in line and asked why they were there and offered to show them how to use the ATM as if no one ever used an ATM before. Jump in and help the tellers when you see more than 5 people in line how about some team spirit instead of that's not my job.
0,"Food was pretty good. The power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 90-95 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable. The manager said \""we can't control Nevada power.\"" Creamed spinach was no good. Lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  The steak just ok."
1,"Triptych Brewing is exactly what the C-U area needs; an honest no frills establishment for those who like BEER. Some peanuts or something might be a good idea, but you don't want to spoil this little gem by adding unnecessary things, or taking away from the primary focus, which is beer. I'm a Savoy local and can walk here. I come for the beer, and stay for the peaceful environment. This type of establishment will draw beer lovers and repel trouble makers. I don't want to sound like nouveau riche heel, but an IPA would be nice. Oh yeah, bring back that spicy chile beer (sans the chocolate flavor), I loved it!"
1,"So I was going to head over to Buffalo Wild Wings yesterday with my wife and daughter, then I remember hearing about ATL Wings from a from, and thought I would give it a shot. \n\nLet's just say I won't be going to the other place anymore. \n\nNot only were the wings the best I've had, I came back the next day to get my coworkers ( and myself) some for lunch, and the owner remembered my name and what I had the day before when I asked for sauce suggestions. \n\nAnyway, best wings, great people!"
1,"I have been impressed by AutohausAZ service, their prices are great and all the parts that I have ordered where quality material, exactly what their website have stated. And the price is definitely the best.  I just ordered a set of halo rotors, they arrived within 2days."
0,"Fail.\n\nThey serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday. \n\nThe waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc. \n\nFrench fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.\n\nMy clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. \n\nOrdered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: \""Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!\"" (WHAAA???) Me: \""No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier.\"" Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam. Fail! \n\nFriend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.\n\nThe wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some \""fruity tart\"" type flavored white wine. She said it was \""tinny\"" tasting and not good. Fail.\n\nThe pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs. \n\nThe paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head. \n\nI will not be back!"
1,"For a fast, healthy and fairly inexpensive option for lunch at the Scottsdale Quarter, I would say this is the place to eat at.  They have a simple menu as well as fresh baked goods all out on display making it easy to order.  I like the fact that you are not served at this restaurant.  You go up to the register order, pay and wait for your food to be brought to the table.  C3 serves the same food as Chloe's Corner across the street in Kierland.  I often order the salad and sandwich combo which has always been fresh and good. \nThey now have a frequent customer card that tally's up points every time you purchase something."
1,Review wrong restaurant.  This one is located in Walmart.
0,"Went recently, and the sushi did not seem as fresh as I remember. I am not sure I would go back."
0,"I can not believe how underwhelmed I was by this place.  Perhaps my mistake was not doing the signature course meals. I didn't like what was being served on the 4 course meal (120 per person)  The place is super nice and the ambiance is great.  Servers/hostesses were all great but for what I paid for, I feel like I got totally jipped.  \n\nThe portions are ridiculously tiny and NOT worth what you pay for.  \n\nKing salmon sashimi - 18 ish dollars.  4 measily tiny pieces.  Seriously... FOUR\n\nFoi Gras Brulee - 25 dollars - This was THE thing that was the saving grace to this restaurant.  I wanted to bathe in it it was so tasty.\n\nMe: Pork dish - crispy pork paired with another pork loin wrapped in bacon served with some kind of greens and carrots.  Sounds amazing right?  EHH WRONG. \n\nCrispy pork was good but not knock my socks off and take me to bed good.  It was just meh.  The pork loin wrapped in bacon was tough.  COME ON  I pay 40+ bucks for this meal and it's tough?  I can't even cut it with the knife you give me?  Give me a break\n\nfriend: veal cheeks.  Those were tender served with some pickled veggies of some sort and a very creamy mashed potato type of thing.  That dish was pretty good but we weren't blown away by it.  Not to mention, the portion was super small.  I think that if we hadn't had buffet for lunch, we would have walked out of this still hungry and ticked off.  \n\nLast but not least... if I'm going to spend that kind of money on a place, I should expect to not feel rushed.  We were in and out of there in about 45 minutes.  Almost felt like they had the dishes waiting and mildly heated them up before everything came out.\n\nBlah... Totally underwhelmed.   Never going here again."
0,"I had very \""interesting\"" experience today. 6 days ago schedule appointment online for 7:30 a.m. for oil change.  I got here at 7:30 a.m., waited for 15 minutes in line. Then front desk person Justin told me that is no any technicians until 8 a.m. Waited for 15 minutes more. Then tech showed up and pulled my vehicle inside. I tried their coffee - very funny taste, reminds me a coffee from Sri Lanka I had once on vacation a while ago. Tastes like it was brewed couple days ago and they warm it up for me this morning. But it was great morning and I don't believe everything was bad in this shop. FREE WI-FI!!! After oil change, they adjust/check my tire pressure and tpms tire pressure sensors stopped working. Front desk person said it's my vehicle computer malfunctioning... What a coincidence. Never had any problems before. I will study this problem more and ask my friends for advice... Great Friday morning, looking forward to weekend."
1,"I had an excellent experience with this company. They came out for a no pressure estimate and explained all of my options and the pricing. Then they were patient while I decided and even had them re-quote different styles for me. They under-promised and over-delivered, which is great. They estimated three weeks and my gate was installed in one."
0,"I would give this place a 4 star rating for value and flavor. Everything else from\nCleanliness, location, outside surroundings ambience etc almost wants me to knock it down to a 1.\nOriginally we were headed to Lotus of Siam but they were closed. We tried the neighboring Korean restaurant and it was closed too. This rundown strip mall is riddled with Korean restaurants and this one happened to be the only one open on a Sunday afternoon. I honestly would never come to this type of strip mall under any circumstances but the lure of yelps promise was hard to resist. The parking lot was barren! Tumble weeds and a gang of pigeons hiding underneath a broke down van. I had to open up my yelp app just to make sure those 4 stars came from recent reviews. We walked in and it was like walking into one of those salons in a ghost town. Outdated, barren, empty, tables that have not been bussed and posters of food as the only decor. The two ladies that waited on us was very friendly and accommodating and is one of the biggest reasons I would like to give them more stars. We looked over the menu, the usuals I wanted was not there and there was no dish I could get for $10 which I thought would be pretty high for the way the establishment looked. I wanted to walk out but we were the only ones there and the girl was really nice. We ended up ordering an assortment of meats that we grill ourselves, good for two, comes with rice, drinks and the usual array of pickled sides $35.95. The grill and vent was clean. When she brought the plate of meat I was truly disturbed with the raw chicken and it's juices on the same plate as the thinly sliced steak. So if you go ask for your chicken on a separate plate. She helped us grill it and the flavors were different not as sweet as the other Korean restaurants I patron but still it was good and different in an interesting way. We were stuffed and she was still bringing us meat this is the most meat I have ever gotten at any Korean restaurant. Everything I needed more of they brought over promptly, without extra charge and without and attitude. This is a big deal for me because in other Korean restaurants they usually don't follow up on you, they have reservations about giving you extra of their sides and one I actually got into an argument for a to go box. These ladies checked on us frequently and brought us everything we needed another reason I wish I could give them a better score. In the end our total was $38.95 which  I think was pretty damn good for all that food. I was certain despite all the negatives I would rate this place 3 stars but midway through this review we both experienced an onslaught of mild stomach agitation and when my boyfriend came out of the restroom his first words were drop it to two stars so yea."
1,"This place is super fun especially if you have little kids to make having sushi an experience.  My son loves to sit at the countertop area and watch all the different sushi go by then pick what he wants to eat.\nThe good thing too is the fact that the portions are smaller so if you're a kid you can try a varieties of dishes to discover what you like to eat and as the parent, you're not breaking the bank as your kid is embarking on this culinary adventure.\nMy son has a great time here.  He will ask to come here and happily for me, each time he'll pick up his favorites like salmon sushi and California roll but he will also pick out one or two new dishes to try.\nIt's great to come here during happy hour which is when I try to go as both my son and I can get fill up on sushi for around $12 for the two of us.\nI can't imagine this happening anywhere else.\nThe staff is friendly.  Always with a smile and prompt with service."
0,"Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff was nice, so I guess that's how they earned their star."
1,"I order from this place a lot and it's always been very good. The family loves it, I usually get pepperoni and sausage, regular crust with parmesan topping. The White Cheesy is always a good choice, the cheesy bread is awesome. I've had better pizza, but, for the price nobody else can touch Marcos"
1,"I like thid place.  I have seen it several times and never stopped in. I was excited when I was invited to a Halloween party here. I had a great time. The line at the bar moved farely quickly.  The staff was professional and friendly.  I should have come here sooner. The dj (Bow Wow Wow) was friendly and approachable.  On theother side was a cover band playing ,so it was fun to float between dance floors. \n\nI definitely want to go back again. Great venue."
1,"My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.  I think it helped make the wedding reception more pleasurable as we had already had an opportunity to meet.  Angela made it so easy to arrange."
0,"didnt like it. i thought because it was the golden nugget that it would be realy great, saddly it wasnt. there wasnt alot to chooes from and the hot food wasnt even hot, bearly warm is more like it. and if you like salad, dont bother coming here either it all looked like nobody put any though into the food, just kinda slaped a few styles together and called it a buffet. deffentaly not worth the $18.99"
1,"I tried Toast for the first time this past weekend and would definitely recommend it.  I came in for brunch with a friend, and yes, there was about a 15 minute wait, but they served us coffee in the meantime.  And they offer you corn bread and apple butter as soon as you're seated - a great start. It's a much bigger space than I expected, and they really efficiently take care of everyone with the team service.  Even though some other reviews have noted that you don't get to develop a relationship with the servers,  they were all incredibly friendly and helpful so it really didn't matter to me.  We got omelettes and a side of french toast and everything was great.  It was exactly what we wanted and served incredibly quickly but without rushing us.  I'll definitely be back."
1,"There's a reason Poke Express has a solid 5 star rating with the amount of reviews that it has.  Poke on its own is absolutely delicious and amazing, but what really sets this place apart is the owner.\n\nFor an \""express\"" eatery, the customer service that Darren and company present is above and beyond what you would expect.  He takes incredible pride in what they produce.\n\nUpon hearing that my friends and I were from New York, he insisted that we sample every single one of the pokes they had available, with absolutely no obligation to buy anything.  The passion with which they believe in their product and authentic happiness they express for your enjoyment of their stock is infectious.\n\nOf course my companions and I ended up getting a few pounds of poke.  It doesn't matter how full you might be, there's always room for pounds of poke!"
0,"Ok. So I have run bars for 12 years.  This place originally caught my eye after an Andrew dice clay show at vinyl.  Guitarist was great.  Atmosphere pretty good.  No coors light wtf.  I guess they sold out to Budweiser.  Not cool.  So having a pretty good time dancing in front of the guitarist playing sublime.  Not getting crazy or anything and the GM wants to call security on my friend because \""he's intoxicated\"".  Yes. HES IN A BAR IN A CASINO!   Duh. He was by no means being inappropriate or out of hand.  From running bars I know the difference.  After security gets there I talk to security and assure them that nothing is wrong.  Well GM bullshits and gets my boy kicked out.  Total douche move.  Even after I talk to him and try to reason he becomes even more of a fucking asshole and kicks me out for \""talking rowdy\"".  Really??   I'd like to see him outside and show him \""ROWDY\"".  This place is not part of Hard Rock and should be kicked to the fucking curb!!!"
1,"Stopped in for a morning pastry and coffee.  It was December and they were in full christmas mode.  Pannetones being offered for order, and the like.  The pastry case was full of a huge selection of different pastries.  A nice lady took my order of almond croissant and gave me my coffee.  Good coffee, and the croissant was a-freaking mazing.  Sorry, but regular words wouldn't do.  Fresh, so flakey and full of real buttery goodness.  Some tecchies with atrocious cell phone manners had sandwiches and salads at the next table over and seemed happy.  I definitely was happy to find a rare bakery that makes excellent pastries. Themselves.  I overheard the lady at the counter say she gets there in the wee hours of the morning to start baking. I don't get to that neighborhood much, but will stop in as often as I can for sure."
0,"Probably should give this one star, but can't bring myself to go that low.\n\n+ Huge buffet that is laid out so as to allow for plenty of room to maneuver\n+ Buffet was kept well stocked - nothing was ever low or empty\n+ Staff was very friendly and very prompt with clearing plates and getting refills\n\n- The food. The majority of it. Here's why:\n\n- The sushi rolls were laden with crab-like-slaw; every roll had a healthy dollop of it\n- Each piece of sushi I tried was warm-to-hot; this scares me\n- The rolls were covered in various sauces - I'd rather they feature the fish than some cheap, mayo-based sauce\n- The tuna nigri was dry and also warm\n- The salmon nigri was very hard to chew and was warm to the touch\n\n- The General Tso's chicken tasted quite odd; not anything like what I've had before\n- Broccoli and chicken was barely lukewarm; chicken was decent but flavorless\n- Egg rolls were very crispy, but I'll be darned if I could tell what they were filled with\n\n+ Potstickers were tolerable; wish they had little bowls for the sauce\n\nSo... I'm pretty sure I won't be back. The \""value\"" of an inexpensive buffet isn't worth the lottery-like-quality.\n\nUPDATE (24 hours later): I experienced some serious \""discomfort\"" in the 'ole digestive tract later in the evening and through part of the next day. I suspect the lack of proper food storage temperature may have played a role. I would urge Journey to check the temperatures of all of their foods - sushi rolls should not be lukewarm, and hot dishes should be hot."

You can only pair one device to it. Each additional device is $14 per device per day....that's ridiculous. \nPool area was large with gambling outside, kinda cool....

1,I've been going to Phuket for several years. The food is on par if not better than other Thai restaurants I've been to in the city. The curry dishes are very flavourable.  The menu has also been expanding adding in other Asian dishes. Throw in excellent friendly service and you have a nice eating experience in the East End.
0,"We planned my daughters 21 st birthday here.  We used a Vip service. There was 20 of us.  The doormen never let my daughter in and we were all upstairs waiting for her.  on Halloween they wouldn't let her in with her costume, a teddy bear..???...\nIf you want to get pick pocketed go to this club!

No ID either what a hassle at the airport.  \nTao RUINED  our trip..."
1,"Went here as part of a company bonding experience (read: paid day to go to the pool) and overall had a pretty awesome time!\n\nOf course, the big highlight was the slide - it's one of the top 10 things to see in Vegas from what I've heard.  The first time I didn't see squat.  The second time I decided to lean up and focus a little - I saw a flash of grey fish.\n\nI think the fourth or fifth time I got it down to where I fully saw the aquarium while I was sliding!\n\nThe pool is nice, though a bit small.  I absolutely love waterfalls and they have two, so big props for that.\n\nWe had two cabanas and, sadly, the service was very, very slow.  It wasn't an overly-busy day and the lady would take SO long to come around, food took forever to get delivered and the general quality wasn't on par for a real cabana, VIP-type experience.\n\nTake a gander at the fish tank - lots of cool sharks in there.  =)"
0,"Tom's was recommended by my brother, who said they had burgers like the So Cal neighborhood burger joints (we call them ghetto burgers).  Having fond memories of the burger joint in Valinda from my high school and college days, I was excited when I heard this news.  Living on the southwest side of Las Vegas, Tom's is a bit of a trek since it's in North Las Vegas but we were willing to give it a shot. \n\nNow I have two criteria that test the legitimacy of any \""ghetto burger\"" place...whether or not they have Orange Bang, a neighborhood staple, and the quality of their chili cheese fries.\n\nLooking forward to a cup of Orange Bang the size of my head, I was highly disappointed to find out that Tom's didn't have Orange Bang...one strike against!  We proceeded to order Tom's classic cheeseburger, a pastrami burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The cheeseburger and pastrami burger tasted like those found in Cali and were pretty good. However, I wasn't impressed at all with the chili cheese fries.  The chili was just average and was seasoned a bit too heavily with cumin. Plus, the French fries in the Cali spots are usually on the thicker side but Tom's uses thinner fries that get soggy much quicker....strike two against!! Lastly, Tom's is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. For the two burgers, chili cheese fries, and a large drink, we paid almost $18.  This is around what you would pay in Cali but the portions are much larger, so there is less value for the money with Tom's......strike three against!! \n\nIf you live close by and like So Cali style charbroiled ghetto burgers, then you may enjoy Tom's, but for me, it's just not worth the drive from the other side of town."
1,"Really really enjoyed watching this show. The music is just so dreamy and the theatre is so beautiful. I think we saw it some time last year, so this post is quite late. However, in any case, my love and I had an amazing time. Can't wait to go back to Vegas and see more shows!"
1,"Classic sports bar...great bar food (wings are the bomb!!), service is good for food type...it's not a steak house people!!!! Love coming here with friends to have a drink, play pool or shuffle board, and catch up with sports. Fun happy hour specials...come check it out!"
0,"The chicken fingers used to be really good when they first opened. Loved the ultra thin shoestrings fries too. But now the chicken is undercooked, not the quality it used to be as the crust tastes like ordinary chicken fingers you can get from the drive-thru. The fries are no longer the thin shoestring but regular fries. I'm disappointed because the last 2 times within the last month wasn't a good experience. Please go back to the original recipe and bring back shoestring fries."
1,"Came here for the rides and the view.  I recommend them all, especially the one where you jump off the side of the building.  Do that one last, when you're done with happy hour at the lounge.  Gets you to the bottom floor in no time flat and as no one wants to do that ride there never is a  line to \""get down\"" from the top."
0,"Whoa! I hate complaining BUT... my car came back still needing to be vacuumed. There was dried grass all over the passenger floor and rear as well as a small sticker which I picked up to show the employee. It gets worse, there were spots on the exterior which I could literally scrape off with my nails, which I did right in front of the employee. To their credit, they did offer to take it back and have it vacuumed again but seriously, I had already been there for this basic wash ($12.99) 30 minutes. I didn't have anymore time, that's not their fault but couldn't they have done it right the first time?! How hard can it be to vacuum a car? All-in-all, I wouldn't go there again and wouldn't recommend this place to a friend. About the only good thing was, they were nice to me which is well... nice, that's why I gave them a two star otherwise I'd probably go for the one star vote."
0,casual. loud. ghetto. creeps and cheap half naked Butter-faces (everything is good but her face!!). \n\new never again.
0,"Great food but service was lacking.  I went with a group of friends months ago.  I asked for my food not spicy at all and a friend asked for it very spicy.  When it came out, they had got it mixed up.  Mine was extremely spicy and his was not spicy at all. No big deal, just send it back and have it remade.  It came out the second time, and same thing, the food was the same.  Mine was still extremely spicy and his had no spiciness at all.  We complained to the waitress again.  My friend and I decided to switch food so I had his and he had mine.  The bill came and they charged us for both.  \n\nWhile the food was amazing, the service was lacking."
1,Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
0,"This is a sports bar off the lobby of the Marriott Center City in Charlotte, NC. This is not a big place, but laid out to be a sports bar with a lot of monitors. Went here a night during final four (Basket Ball). The bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive. They have a good selection of beer (however their dispenser of draft was out of service). How can you have a bar with no draft beer? I got a Sam Adams (in a bottle). Tried their Philly Cheese Steak. That is probably the worst Philly cheese steak I have had in my life (and I used to live in Philadelphia). The meat was burnt, the onions were fried beyond belief and the cheese was very greasy. The fries were OK. \n\nIn summary a great location, great server, beer so-so and food not up to par.  Sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook."
1,"FINALLY got to eat here for the first time today. It's a but if a journey from where we live, but with pops in town visiting.. All the more reason to take a cruise. There were 6 of us (ma, pops, the bf, daughter, baby and myself). All I can say is good food and great service!\nOur order: mahi mahi w/fried noodles, Kauai chicken (so ono) w/fried noodles, kalbi and garlic shrimp w/rice and saimin.\nEveryone left with happy opus :) \nNeed to drive out more often just to come eat here"
0,"Im not impressed with this new location at all, I guess disappointed would be the right word. Its in a nice area of Chandler with many new buildings going up so I had high hopes entering this store. Its beautiful inside. Spacious with \""newer\"" more modern decor. Although the wait staff is nothing short of unskilled and unprofessional. THREE out of the four times i came the drive through was closed. Whats the point of a drive through if you never use it. I came in at 2pm on a Tuesday. There was one barista ringing in orders and a line of about four people ahead of me. She was one of the slowest cashiers ever, the woman being serviced demanded a gift card for next time due to poor service. When it finally was my turn, I ordered a mocha light frappacino with added whip cream. Thats not being too difficult is it? Apparently to the barista it was. As I waited for my drink the man ahead of me told here she forgot the cream in his coffee and he stood there for about five minutes because she had to \""get more half and half\"" . Ugh. He was visually upset too. Then when my drink was served, it was a coffee frappacino! I told her my order once again and she made me a mocha light frappacino and for got the added whip. Whatever, I give up and leave. Even though this location is convenient...its not worth the headache."
1,"This is a really cute restaurant in a really easy to pass location. Just keep your eyes out for the small VG sign on the street. \n\nThe food is great. Clean, minimal, and fresh.  Not too much fuss so that you can taste the ingredients and how nicely they work with each other. \n\nThe restaurant has a very nice atmosphere too. Again, clean and also very open. \n\nThere are a lot of business lunches going on and \""Housewife\"" gatherings so people are more dressed up than casual. But you can go casual and still feel right at home.  \n\n Their spring salad is one of my favorites ( i can eat it sans dressing) as well as the chicken, and turkey sandwich."
0,"We ate at this restaurant two years ago. I thought it was one of the best Cajun restaurants outside of Louisiana.  \nWe returned tonight.  What a mistake!   This is a poor excuse for a restaurant, much less Cajun .  Service is SLOW!!!  Food is tasteless or over seasoned.  The soup was served lukewarm.  We can not understand why the health department hasn't shut this poor excuse for a restaurant down.\nDO NOT BOTHER TO EAT HERE!  It is a waste of money.  To top it off wait service is auto tip for 6!"
0,"I had the Full Montagu, and yea its a sandwich. Nothing more and nothing less. Not special that's for sure. It was a busy afternoon there, and the line was very long which I actually liked because I thought  that maybe it was going to be awesome. When I started on the sandwich I felt extremely disappointed. There was a little buzz about the place so maybe my expectations were too high."
1,"Our very first visit and I couldn't be more pleased! Excellent food, very friendly owner and staff. I can't believe I've lived in this area for three years and have only just now discovered it. If you like middle eastern food don't miss this little gem. You won't be disappointed!"
1,"If you want to have your phone fix (cracked screen, water damage etc..) this is the place you want to go for all you phone issues. Great and friendly staff that can fix your phone in a short period of time and at a low price compared to their competitors. They also have many accessories if you would like to pimp out your phone or just want to protect your valued phone."
0,"I've been to Rinaldi's several times now. To me, it's one of those places that after the first bite, I get annoyed at myself for not remembering how disappointing it was the last time and wonder why I'm back.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. This place in essence is really no different than the deli counter at the low end food store down the street from wherever it is you live - and let's be honest, places like Safeway make a point of a good deli counter and put this place to shame - all at a lower cost.\n\nDon't be fooled by the quintessential \""New York\"" decor on the walls such as a photo of downtown NYC and a poster of Italian movie mobsters. I lived in New York and this is not a real NY deli. This place wouldn't make it through opening weekend.\n\n2 slices of deli meat on a thin bed of shredded lettuce, and a layer of mayo on a crumbly hoagie roll does not transport me back to Mulberry St. \n\nThe two stars are awarded to their breakfast burritos. It's pretty hard to mess up eggs."
1,"So basically, if you don't like stir fry paradise, you have no soul. Plain and simple.\n\nI'll admit, it took me a few months to get my exact sauce-combination down, and I am disappointed that they do not have the \""sriracha hot chili sauce\"" to put on top (you know the stuff....bright red chile sauce, green lid... has a rooster picture on it..) but I still love this place.\n\nOther reviews are accurate. Staff is amazingly friendly, and they all seem to be family. The food is cooked fast, and you create it yourself to your liking. LOTS of meat choices: beef, pork, turkey, chicken, tofu, shrimp. Fresh veggies and most importantly: cilantro....... LOVE it. \n\nSide items are delish. Egg rolls and spring rolls for you vegetarians, 2 kinds of soup, a few other things...... but best of all are their fried pastry things. Basically they are really airy doughnut holes, fried and covered in sugar. My god. I would go there just for them. Also when you get your check, there's cute little tasty candies with it. Dinner for two is under $20."
1,I would agree with most people that this place is pricey but David Johnson the wine and beer guy is very knowledgeable and the staff is friendly. Ask David and he can steer you into some great values on the liquor. They also have very affordable events and carry Arizona wine now-Yeah!
1,"Best waffle I've ever had...I made my own with a chocolate waffle, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, raspberries, cherry pie filling, blueberries, whip cream and powdered sugar.  Pure bliss!"
0,"It has been said by many before me, but skip the line and keep on walking to a casino. When I went, the line was wrapped around the block and they weren't letting anyone in. No news on when they would let anyone in so we waited for 10 minutes, then decided to bail. I had heard the guys on the show don't even show up except for filming but it still would've been nice to pop in for a photo or two if the line wasn't so long."
1,"Conveniently located right off  of the lobby/check in area of the Augustus and Octavius towers.  Staff service great, very pleasant, and knowledgeable of the product - they knew that some Starbucks had started to replace Tazo tea with Tevana.  they accept Starbucks cards but they dont have a reader so it takes a little longer as they have to manually enter the card number.  that said, my transaction was handled pretty quickly and the person at the register did not grumble while entering the card number - very pleasant experience.  Nice bench to sit on, but no tables/ chairs as its a smaller corner spot.  Standard food items available."
1,Dr. Cruz is a very good physician.  She actually touches you and listens to what you are telling her and tries to get you to the right diagnostic testing or specialist.  I have enjoyed having her as my physician and my family's physician.  The office is clean and the staff is usually pretty professional and attentive.  Not sure if she is returning to the practice so I had to find another primary care physician but would prefer to see Dr. Cruz again.
0,"Waited to be seated, no one seated us. We sat down at one of many empty tables. Five minutes later, a fellow told us ALL the table were reserved. This place was only 25% full at most. So we left. Walked by in a bit after eating elsewhere, and it was still mostly empty. Guess they didn't want our money."
1,"I had waited for a year to cut my hair after leaving Roy, my fav in tucson. i tried AJ because she did great things with a friend of mine with similarly textured hair. I also really like Dally's hair and didn't know until after my first visit that she was responsible for that too. My first cut was fine. i just got it trimmed to get the damaged ends off. also a highlight. the salon itself is very private - only one client at a time. so, i got to know Aj a little. She's sweet and down to earth with the talent of a dramatic and unavailable stylist sans the ego. \nThe second time i went in for a cut. I said something to her about Maria's haircut in The Sound of Music. She offered donate lengths. I didn't quite have enough. She took off eight inches from the bottom and more from the top. I'm accustomed to letting the stylist decide what to do with my hair. so, when AJ asked me shag or bob style? i wasn't prepared. I said, \""I dont' want a soccer mom do.\"" So she opted for playful shag in the back. It was so liberating to just take all that hair off just when the summer is getting cooking. \nWhen i got home, my husband, who scares easily said,\""I love it. Get in my bed.\""\nThird haircut got it down pat. Turns out i am much more of a bob girl than a shag girl. I should know that. the guy at bookman's used to refer to me as a \""junior league\"" type. which i'm not. but i'm also not one to flip my hair up in back like a past Oprah hairdo. I'm not \""fun\"" like that. I'm messy, though, and this hairdo is perfect for me. I have gotten so so many compliments on it. \nThanks, AJ. and all the girls at The Roose. See you soon."
1,"Reasonable prices, great service, unique and delicious rolls.  This one is also in a great location right in Kierland Commons.  I consider myself very picky when it comes to sushi and this is a place I am very appreciative of having recommended to me.  I am a true fan of RA!"
1,"Stayed here about a month ago.  This was really a great hotel.  It's very classic feel, but with brand new bedding, TV, and bathrooms so no old dirty feeling in the rooms.  The employees were super nice, I found a good rate online making it a bargain for downtown.  This is where I'll stay next time I'm in Charlotte."
1,"Reviewing about the swimming pool/steam room and sauna.\n\nI have been using these facilities since September 2013. I chose to join their club due to a corporate offer they had: \u00a330 per month including gym, sauna, swim, steam room at no additional cost, longer hours than the Dalry leisure pool and closer to my office. \n\nAdditionally, they offer courtesy towel, shower gel and shampoo in showers that have curtains. No need to have coins to use a locker - staff will give you a key when they scan and keep your membership card. \n\nUnfortunately the pool is only 12meters long, but it's not that busy as other places I have been so you could swim in circles if you like! \n\nSauna reaches only up to 93 degrees roughly - I would love it being a bit warmer. \n\nFrom time to time the shampoo or shower gel might have finished in two of the three showers so you need to look for one that still have some, but if you bring your own no need to worry. \n\nBetter have your sandals with you, as people will walk with their shoes in the area where you walk after your shower and go to change next to your locker. \n\nStill a member and yes, recommending it!"
0,"2 Star rating on average? Seems about right.\nI've been to the old gameworks on the strip, which was pretty old and dank, but was two stories.\nI don't see them having enough business to pay for the strip's rent, so I understand.\n\nMoving to the Town Square is a great move.\n\n\nPros: \n\n- Love that they were open until midnight. Went to a movie at 10:45 and wanted to kill time before.\n-It was pretty fun \n-The prizes really are better than most places (keep in mind, most prizes are for kids, and kids love these weird prizes)\n-Bowling looked pretty cool, didn't see prices though\n\nNew ticket system could be seen as pro or con.\nAll tickets go back on the card\n\nCons:\n\n-NOTHING FREAKING WORKS. I mean seriously. You just opened.\nThere is about 7 basketball games, only two worked.\n-Operator didn't work (wish I could play that)\n-2 wheel spinning games didn't work\n-Spaceballs worked and then would flash out of order, then work again.\n-Tetris style game didn't work\n-A couple of games ate our game card points and didn't work\n-A few more games didn't work.\n\nA total of about 1/3 of the games didn't work which is pretty lame since it is really busy in there.\n\n-It definitely should be bigger with more games.\n-The gameperks doesn't work here because \""their system isn't synced\""\n-They are very very slow. Workers took a long time to load points on the cards, one time was out of printer paper and wouldn't let people buy cards for about 20 minutes.\n-VIP members have different credit pricing but we can't get the VIP member pricing?\n\nWe spent quite a bit of money here for a birthday.\nAbout $130 and got about 8,000 tickets (which are all kept on the card)\nUsed 3200 for a giant lego pillow (cooler prizes than most places)\nDon't know if we will be back"
1,"Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)"
0,"Disgusting...blah.  I am not real picky when it comes to casual restaurants.  But I have to admit, some of this food was barely edible.  The calamari was so chewy, it tasted like rubber.  The turkey burger ordered by one comrade came out pink.  That is a little scary since turkey really should be thoroughly cooked.  My eggplant ravioli was tolerable but made my husband gag.  One person ordered the pastrami sandwich and picked at it...and I have to say, we are not the kind to snub our noses at good sandwiches.  The only thing that was pretty good was the chicken pot pie.  \n\nOn top of the nasty food, our waitress seemed completely stoned.  It took her 10 minutes to get us our drinks and she would disappear for several minutes at a time.  When we asked her questions, she had not clue what the answer was and had to go ask someone else.  Seriously incompetent.  So, my suggestion is to steer clear of this place."
0,I like walmart for their low prices and that is it...their customer service is sub par and eventually I won't shop there at all unless absolutely have to...as far as THIS location (S. Tryon)...I HATE IT. That is all...
0,"Been a Cox customer many years, recently moved and needed internet service at the new home, have my own modem/router, get a call from them stating a tech will be at the new house to hook me up, needed a time frame, they said absolutely nothing about a 60 dollar house call charge, for pete's sake, for years they only needed your modem number and you could easily just do it yourself, well they already had my modem number, i was transferring service, the tech showed up on time and asked which jack I planned on using for the modem, it wasn't until a month later when we decided to move the computer upstairs and needed the connection from comp to modem hardwired since the wife works from home and needs the most reliable of connections, all other jacks in the house are dead, only the one works, so had a chat session with Cox, they will be happy to send out a tech to make that new jack live so I can use it for 60.00 tech charge, I told them to screw off, I noticed the last tech cut a bunch of lines into the box, left the coaxial ends in the rocks too, I'll bet ten to one that before he showed up the entire house was live at all jacks, and I'm still trying to figure out how I went from 32.99 per month for internet only to 62.99, nearly a 100 percent increase. Google, we need you to come to Phoenix and give cox some friendly competition."
0,Ghetto! No wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm!! Seriously disappointed. Jacuzzi didn't work right. Furniture was falling apart. Very sad hotel.
1,"OMG! \nOne hell of a show. \nIf you are not a Puritan, you will laugh your ass off. \nA pseudo cirque meets vaudeville meets HBO comedy special. \nSome eye candy thrown in for good measure. \nMy friends & I had a blast. \nA few of us actually peed our panties. It was that good. \nHighly recommend."
1,"I really liked this branch.  The personnel I dealt with, from the teller, banker, to the manager are all so nice, helpful, and best of all knowledgeable.  This is the nicest banking center I have encountered by far.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like is the busy location.  Traffic-wise...geez how I hate driving on Maryland PKWY.  Nonetheless, this banking center is big, many PBs on duty, excellent customer service (for me at least).  \n\nI will go back as it is convenient and of course, having knowledgeable PBs and management personnel is the best when it comes to one's finance."
0,"This was a big let-down. The menu had so much potential, and the service was great. However, the food was very disappointing. I ordered the steak frites and it was overcooked, thin, and lacking flavor. The frites were also not impressive. My husband's veal shoulder was also rather bland.  Everything was very overpriced. Brasserie 33 is a much better option for French fare."
0,"I was hoping to find a nice alternative to the limited choices on MC85. I was disappointed. The sandwich was bland. Definitely not worth the price. I was given homemade potato chips which damn near broke my teeth because they were so hard. It's the same food as Millstone Cafe but without any flavor. If I'm going to pay that much for a sandwich, I expect it to taste better than average. :("
1,"Takara is an excellent option for a sushiphiles looking for good Sushi in the Madtown area.\n\nComing from Chicago, I have been spoiled by an overabundance of cheap, yet excellent, sushi restaurants.  Whenever I come home to Madison and have a craving for Sushi, I've found that there are very few options that meet my standards.  Takara is a simple, yet tasty, destination  to satisfy your sushi fix.\n\nYou won't be blown away but fancy rolls featuring exotic deep fried fare.  Takara offers fresh staple items for an incredibly reasonable price.\n\nTake advantage of their cheap lunch specials.  Enjoy!"
1,"Is it the GREATEST SANDWICH ON EARTH? Hell no! But it's fast and inexpensive with crisp-tasting ingredients, and served on really fresh, good-quality bread. It is very good. Service is quick and efficient and the restaurant is clean. The menu is easy to maneuver and I hear they deliver, too."
0,"This place gets two stars because the food is pretty good but the service really deters me. I called to place an order for pick up. They were in the middle of taking it and said, \""We are really busy can I call you back?\""\n\nThey informed they had caller I.D. and repeated my number back to me. After waiting over an hour they never called back. Who does that? I'll never be eating here again."
1,"You can count on excellent quality and fresh baked goods daily. The patisseries are refined and always delicious. I am addicted to their home made salads and strong coffee. \nYou can order customized cakes and impress your guests. Everything here is made with the finest ingredients. It never disappoints. \n\nThe service is formal. You are always treated with respect. Sometimes I don't mind when they call me Madame but I always correct them and ask to be called \""Mademoiselle, SVP!\""\n\nI guarantee you will return here many times."
1,"I went to Rochelle's Salon once before and hated the girl who did my hair. After about a year later, I slowly got the courage to give Rochelle's Salon another chance, but only for a blow dry and style. We kept dating like this for a while. They referred me to Abel who did a great job and eventually, the relationship progressed and I now trust him to cut my hair and color it. I love Rochelle's and am now a loyal girlfriend. Abel is great, creative, easy-going, and very accommodating as most my appointments are last minute. In addition, he's great at giving dating advice-NOT, but it's hilarious to hear his escapades being a straight hairstylist. Scandelous. Liz at the front desk has a great memory, too!"
1,Awesome place... a bit on the expensive side but all the food is very good and so are the sweets.
1,Super impressed with the vegetarian options and I love that it is right next door to Gangplank! I get my lunch at Planet Sub and walk on over to the Wednesday Brownbags. Perfect!
1,"This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time."
1,I have only been here once but let me say it was one of the best times EVER! The whole place is sooo sexy and cool. Love the girls dancing in such amazing outfits..loved the free bubbly even more!\nI drank so much I ended up dancing on a table with some girl..the hubby loved that!\nI need to get back again because I had so much flippin fun!!
0,"I think they changed the owner or something.  I used to like this place, but today i bought sweet and sour chicken, it smelled so weird.  Like something is just not right (old ingredients? or old rice?).  This is my first time writing a review online and this restaurant deserve my time so that i can warn everyone about this place.  Save your time and money, and maybe your health by avoiding this place.  It used to be a good restaurant, not anymore."
0,"One of my really good friends recommended I come here, so I stopped by for dinner. Overall, appearance is really nice, atmosphere is nice and buffet was really well kept. \nThe dinner buffet is about $35 a person, includes a drink and then when you're seated, this big fancy glass bottle of water for the table. Water is water to me. \nMy boyfriend and I immediately hit the buffet. From a glance, everything looked so good, as far as appearance. All their food comes in little pots and cute bowls/plates, I thought it was a nice touch. \nThey have A LOT of seafood! My boyfriend and I are not seafood lovers, we hate seafood, so already we felt like this was a mistake. They had a build your own macaroni and cheese bar which the chef makes right in front of you, it was really good, but thats about it. They had tons of sushi and seafood-esque items. They had a small portion of prime rib in the very corner and just two or three chicken and beef dishes. \nTheir dessert bar on the other hand was to die for! They have a gelato bar and all these adorable delicious desserts. Probably the best part of the night. \nWe left a little unsatisfied and still a little hungry because their wasn't much for us. Maybe it was the night we chose to come on (a Sunday), I don't know. \nI will probably not return. On the other hand, if your a seafood lover, GO GO GO!"
0,"I am surprised to see other reviewers rate it anymore than an one. I would have given it a zero if it was an option.  We went to the zoo with my family, as we are visiting the Scottsdale area, plopping a hefty $45, expecting to be blown away. I am not well versed in zoo's other than as a mom of two young kids only to find an endless walk to see no animals. This zoo/park reminded me of a deserted zoo- could it be the time of year (Dec)- I don't think so.  Yelpers!! Take your money elsewhere. Did I happen to tell you that I asked for a refund and got a flat out NO REFUNDS. They offered tickets for another day but if I did not see any animals in the park why would I travel again for the same sub par experience?? The two supervisors listened with their Starbucks in hand and had a lot of reasons why our experience was terrible. Not exactly what I expect from a business."
0,"My poor children who live out of state, have no idea how cheap and ugly the flowers I just received from Carmel Florist are. They do not resemble the online photo at all. I actually laughed at the gentleman who delivered them to my door. They spent $60 and they are not even worth $6. Shame on you for calling yourself a florist! I took photos just to prove what was delivered."
1,"I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now."
0,I got a coupon so I decided to bring a group of 5 people here. We went to the service desk and multiple employees were just chatting and hanging around not helping the line of customers. We ended up waiting 45 minutes bowl and decided to go to the bar and wait. The food was nothing special and the bartenders were rude. Once we stated bowling we were supposed to have a server come to us but no one ever came. I had to track one down at the end to settle our bill and it took multiple times for her to get it correct. Won't be going back to this place. Would not recommend it. Terrible service.
1,"My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago. \n\nThe bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite, but the white bean and tomato barely edged out the salami/pesto and mozzarella and tomato and basil. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the 8-10 choices on the menu.\n\nI was very impressed with the food. I ordered the Nine Iron Panini and really enjoyed my meal. The panini was cooked perfectly. The chicken, bacon, mozzarella and dijonnaise went very well together. \n\nOften at trendier places, I'm not full after my meal. Postino filled me up though.\n\nThe service was very good. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and provided the check in a timely manner.\n\nI can see why this place is popular. Very good food, nice atmosphere and a place to enjoy some wine with friends in a casual setting. \n.\nThe only downside is the limited parking and valet parking."
1,"Very nice hotel - new, modern and non-smoking! It was nice to not have a casino here. We liked being up on the 29th floor - could see a lot. Loved the automatic shades in the room, the large shower, the quick and quietly flushing toilet, and especially the tub!!!\nPrices in the market cafe were a little steep, but that's LasVegas. I appreciated being able to get a latte there in the morning.\nWe took advantage of the free valet parking. The valets were very nice and efficient. We also got to check in early - wasn't expecting that we could but a nice surprise."
0,"Scratch my last review.  If I could give 0 stars I would, but 1 is the minimum.  Well, I guess I can give 1 star for the poor service guy that had to deal with my pent up frustrations from enduring the dis-functional service at Airpark Jeep.  Where to begin:  They never entered in the $2300 service/maintenance/extended warranty plan that I bought with my Jeep into my vehicle profile at the service shop.  So I paid for 2.5 years worth of oil changes etc. for no reason (even after I claimed I had one in the beginng)...then I found the agreement when I moved 5 months ago and I was not reimbursed the full amount because they pay a reduced price.  For their failure to get off their lazy tush and see if I had a service plan, I ended up paying more for oil changes...Sure am glad I bought their STUPID $2300 maintenance plan. \nEpic failure #2:  The manager failed to call me back (called 3 times) after I found the paperwork for the warranty and asked about my plan and how to get reimbursed properly.  \nEpic Failure #3:  I called the director of the whole dealership to complain about the manager that never called me back and their stupid warranty 'service' plan, and he never called me back either.  \nEpic Failure #4:  My car has 43, 200 miles on it and for the last 4 oil changes and 1 battery change everyone failed to mention anything about the 30,000 mile preventative maintenance (which could have been done gradually over multiple visits), so today when I went in for an oil change and new brake pads, they informed my I had $941 of service that needed to be done because the 30000 mile stuff wasn't taken care of (they had 13000 to make me aware of the preventative maintenance)....last time I checked that is why you take your car in for regular maintenance so you distribute such costs over time and take care of your car so you don't end up having a PROBLEM!!!! \n\nBottom Line:  Don't go to Airpark Jeep EVER for anything! The service department here is awful and I have no respect for the guy who sold me the crappy service plan either.  And the management seems to be worthless considering they never call anyone back.  I have bought 3 new cars and 2 used cars and have never had any problems like this from any other dealership.  \n\nAlso, I hate writing reviews that trash a place; sometimes people have a bad day...my experience with Airpark has been bad for 2.75 years.  Congratulations Airpark Jeep you earned yourself a hard to achieve 1 star review!"
0,"Wow the food here is greasy, plain, unsatisfying and expensive.  Everything is griddled in butter. I felt like my diet coke was sliding in butter across the table. This is a place that needs to rethink their menu. \n\nWith a location like this they'd be booming if they upgraded their culinary offerings to modern standards, meaning they are currently below Denny's, IHOP, Showmars, KFC, Burger King, Wendys - all places I'd rather eat at in a heartbeat.\n\nThought I'd stop in and check out a local diner that looked really cool from the outside. Woops! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? I don't think so..."
1,"I had my hair and make-up done for an event in Las Vegas and I looked and felt like a celebrity! After reading the reviews on Yelp, I called and spoke with Todd. I made my appointment and he asked if I needed transportation from my hotel on the Strip. I said I did and he recommended a limo driver named Bill that would drop me off and pick me up without \""getting lost\"" like some taxis do. Bill's prices were very affordable so make sure to ask about him if you don't have a car. Todd greeted me at the door and the whole experience was excellent. I left with beautiful Victoria's Secret hair and stunning makeup that made my skin look flawless. I have never had a smoky eye before and I regret I live on the other side of the country because this place does great work! Do yourself a favor ladies and  visit Platinum Entourage when you want to look your very best for that special event."
1,"This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to."
0,The food was just good. Nothing I would write home about. I found a few things that I thought was weird. The first thing is they charge for refills. Really what is the cost to do refills. Second thing as sitting there eating my food some more people came in and them like me was their first visit. They had 9 people in their party. The lady behind the counter said that they 15 percent gratuity. How do you charge this when you have to order at the counter and they don't have to bring you refills of food or drink. \nOn the positive side the people were friendly.
0,"took my mustang for diagnostic and oil change, everything they told me was false, car came back with 5 defective brake lights, car now runs worse than before, car was disgusting when it came back. you guys suck! dont go here if you love your car, their mechanics are shi*t! worst customer service!!\n\nupdate* ford were wrong about my diagnosis that i paid $130 for!\n\nall i needed was an o2 sensor that should have been warrantied by law as the car is less than 7 years old and has less than 70,000 miles. guess ill be looking further into this"
0,"Food was borderline satisfactory & service was horrible. I ordered a teriyaki bowl, miso soup & large drink. I asked if I could get my teriyaki 5-10 minutes after my soup so it won't get cold while I'm enjoying my soup course. I asked this because in past visits they would arrive at the same time.  They arrived at the same time again. \n\nI also informed them that they were out of iced tea. They didn't seem to care. An hour later, still no tea. They made no effort to make tea. It takes 5 minutes to brew tea."
1,"I had a craving for Mexican food tonight... which happens rarely enough that I should I should indulge. I had no idea where to get good Mexican food in Champaign, but a quick Yelp search brought up Fiesta Cafe, which is conveniently located just a few blocks from my apartment, and also stays open everyday until 12am (an oddity in Champaign where a lot of restaurants are closed by 10pm). \n\nSo I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!"
0,"Bartenders= 100% cool. Bouncers = Douche-bags. Management= A step above a monkey in a suit. Great place for sub-standard food that is way overpriced.  It also has really nice cheap and corny decor inside.  If you wear Tap-Out gear with a bandana tied on your head or if you are a 45+ patron \""trying\"" to recapture a youthful night of fun, come here and you will fit right in.  You could throw a dart at a map and find an establishment with better food and there are waaaaay more places in walking distance that are more fun to grab a drink at.\nSaddle Ranch (even the 2 in LA), you guys should crawl in a hole and die."
0,"we dined here on our first wedding anniversary. We had high expectations from this AAA 4 diamond and michelin rated restaurant. we chose this one in particular since the menu appealed the most to us.\n\nWhen we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.\n\nWe always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.\n\nOur server recommended \""three seas\"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.\n\nWe had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PUR\u00c9E, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish. \n\nFor a michelin rated restaurant, the food fell short of expectations. I've dined at a lot of fine dining restaurants and have had better bang for the buck than here."
0,"How quickly things change! It is a sad day. The man that has run Itchi Bowl for a long time is gone. He has sold out.  We won't be back. The simple teriyaki chicken and rice bowl is gone. They have replaced it with ball of sticky rice and a separate spoon full of chicken. It is hard to believe the food quality could drop so fast but it has. Less quantity, did not taste as good. We even were shorted on our take out order. Hopefully they will figure it out quickly."
0,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\nA tenant said they had some small roaches in the kitchen of one of my apartments. I was out and about and close to this walmart. Rather than park, walk in and search around I figured I'd call their number to see if they carried Combat Roach Killer which seems to do the job.\n\nI call, phone rings and rings about 15 times...finally a lady picks up and I ask if they carry \""Combat Roach Killer\"" for killing roaches.\n\nShe says \""no\"" in an annoyed voice.\n\nI ask, \""Do you carry any roach and insect killer?\""\n\n\""No\"".\n\nOk, so I guess that's that, thinking I will probably have to go to home depot later because I know they carry it.\n\nI get home prior to hitting home depot and check the website of walmart.com to see if they carry what I was looking for.\n\nNot only do they carry roach killer, but this location carries EXACTLY what I was looking for, \""Combat Roach Killer\"" and it's in stock.\n\nIt was around 1pm on 10/25/14 when I called up and got a nasty woman on the phone who didn't care or want to help. \n\nIf any manager is reading this, please fire her.\n\nPathetic."
1,I just picked up my new Oakley sunglasses and they are awesome!!!  I've been going here for the past 5+ years and everytime is fantastic.  The entire staff goes beyond making you feel comfortable during your visit.\nWhether you're getting an exam or picking out the perfect frames they will help every step of the way.
1,"Had their breakfast burrito (without sausage) and it was amazing, and the price was reasonable too."
0,"TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \""promotion\"" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!"
1,"Just stopped by here for dinner the other day and figured I'd write a review.  I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.  Their food is very tasty.  When I went for lunch I thought their selection wasn't as big as other places, but everything was well prepared.  Out of both, I prefered dinner even though we were the only people in the place.  The food came out pretty quick and was super fresh.  The meat samosa, garlic naan, chicken biriyani, chicken curry, and tikki masala were all great.  I think even though everyone seems to love the tikki masala I liked the curry better.  ALSO to note, it was very spicy, more than when prepared for the buffet I think, which I thought was great."
0,"This is the second time we have tried this place, trying to give it a second chance.  NEVER AGAIN :-/  The food is bad and the service sucked :-(  I am actually normally nice and try to be nice in my comments but I have nothing positive to say about this place. The only positive is that I will never have to eat there again :-)"
0,"Used to like coming here when Market Street had a line (as it so often does) but it's getting harder to find something to order.  The hamburger steak used to be reliably good but this time, it was ... off.  I suspect it is due to whatever was cooked on the grill before they cooked the hamburger patties.  The philly steak sandwich wasn't too good either.  Not enough cheese and the meat kind of tasteless - needed salt.  Was so disappointed we didn't go back for the friend wonton and teri beef, which are our usual standbys."
1,"Since our move to the south west valley, my family had been looking for a good chinese restaurant.  I found this restaurant from yelp and other sites and true to form...the reviews pretty much sum up wongs on indian school.  Located on the north side of indian school across from the chase bank..in a dainty strip mall...it sits next door to an unknown bookstore with the most inconsistant store close times...sometimes its open....other times...nope.  anyway.....as you walk into wongs, there is a front table with a  register and an older asian lady that looks very judgemental...the truth of the matter is..she probably is...but who cares, im there to eat!  My family and i go at least once every week or two.  We usually have the chinese eggplant with beef special and my kids devour the lemon chicken.  I once tried the spicy beef with mushrooms...delicious.  i also had experimented with the chicken corn soup....delicious.  you cant really go wong with wongs..give it a try!"
1,Killer menu. One of my favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas. Our waiter spent time with us and knew every little detail about the restaurant and the menu. I'll be back...many times:)
1,"The Pleasance is one of the University of Edinburgh's most used buildings, and the bar in the downstairs area is well worth mentioning.\n\nTypically a student haunt, it provides all that you would expect from a bar of this type.  It also provides food, and shows a variety of sport on its TV screens.  Seating is in comfortable booths, with padded seating and small dividing walls that segregate the bar area, so that it can be full of people without feeling that way.\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced, and the food is typically student in style.  Fajitas, nachos and burgers dominate the menu, and having tried most  of them, I can confirm that they are very tasty, and worth their cheap prices.\n\nI have typically been here on a quieter weekday evening during term time, during which the atmosphere is relaxed.  However, as with most bars, when there is a big sporting occasion, a show in the Pleasance theatre, or just during Freshers' Week, the bar will be a lot busier.\n\nGive the Pleasance Bar a go if you want some cheap student grub, or a relaxed drink with friends."
0,"Didn't live up to the hype.  My steak was OK, but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone.  We tried the arugula salad, heirloom tomatoes, asparagus along with the filet and chicken.  Steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal."
0,"I like Johnny Rockets, but this location sucks.\n\nYou're paying a premium price for a certain experience, and then the experience is lost because of the space it's in. I'd be pissed if I dropped $100 on a steak and then was handed a paper plate and told to sit and eat it on a park bench next to homeless deviants. This isn't much better."
1,"My first time here was last night and I was quite impressed! Half of the walls are white half are red (a nod to wine, no doubt) the lighting fixtures were lovely and the decor was cozy! \nTwo friends and I shared a bottle of wine, some chocolate fondue and quite a lot of laughs! Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable although it seemed as if she was the only one there. \nGreat time great wine great location! Will certainly be returning!"
0,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\nI ordered 50 wings to go b/c we were heading back to San Diego.  They were hot, but they tasted only ok.  I've had better at other Hooters.\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."
0,"The food used to be quite good, but since the change in management there's been a steep decline in quality; nothing tastes as fresh or carefully made. \n\nWe had an issue with delivery as well. Despite being only 10 minutes from the place, it somehow took nearly two hours for the food to get to our house. \n\nWhen it finally got there, the food was okay - the crispy potatoes with beans in spicy sauce were the best thing. I ended up pretty sick the next day, so I don't think we'll be ordering from there again."
1,"Wow, this place is fantastic!!!!\n\nIf you want more than just stores to look at while you're shopping, Caesar's is the place to be.  They have almost everything you're looking for, and the space is amazing.  \n\nI've even spotted a few celebrities while I was shopping here!"
1,"Probably the best place for pizza and calzones. I love the atmosphere and service here. Its very mom & pop, but professional and fun at the same time. I've  taken my friends and family here, and both groups are quite critical in their own way... but they LOVED the place. My best friend Anthony is from NM and seriously comes to visit me because of our frequent visits to Spinatos - not to see me. \n\nObsessed with the spinach calzones. Joey is my favorite server. the riesling is divine.\n\nA+"
1,"Way better than I expected after reading the reviews. Maybe I was just hungry but the food actually tasted good. The crab legs were pre-cut, the prime rib was decent quality, and my favorite things were the clam chowder, spicy tuna rolls, and mashed potatoes.."
1,"I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day."
1,Good car wash at a good price.
0,Customer service sucks hard in the pharmacy department. The bald dude with the beard really needs an attitude adjustment
0,This place is really over-hyped.  We had the edmame dumplings (not sure of the exact spelling !) for starters.  We got four bland flat dumplings filled with some paste and floating in soy I think.  It was really tasteless. Then I asked the server for his recommendation.  He asked us to go for the chicken chopped salad.  The salad was really ordinary. . Lots of cheese blocks..and it was 14$ !!!  I think this restaurant tries too hard to be like the 'hipster' places in san Francisco.  Disappointed !
0,"Definitely a one time only for us, unless we go only to drink.  (Lagunitas IPA on tap...yay!). The nachos were nothing special and certainly the cheese was poured from a can.  The chicken on the nachos may well have been cooked days earlier.  Same with the chicken on the dinner salad.  The dinner salad greens were also poured from a bag, I'm sure. The sliders were made from microwaved diskettes of beef, very clearly not grilled to order.  Also there are three different sliders so be sure to specify exactly what you want.  I thought we did, but we got something other than what we ordered.  The food in the pictures on the menu looks beautiful.  The food on the plate didn't deliver."
0,"Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste, no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning"
1,This place is located in the Fry's parking lot on 51st and Olive. Don't let that fool you. We came in and it is clean and the staff welcoming. It was our first time so we took a minute to look at the menu. We ordered the open face carne asada supreme and 2 of the frybread tacos one with shredded beef and one with carne asada.  By the time we paid the food was on the counter for pickup and the dinning began. The food was excellent. The frybread did not get soggy and stayed crisp throughout. The salsa came in a squirt bottle which was perfect for squirting onto there crispy chips. The food was so much my daughter couldn't finish but that's ok since my husband was enjoying the food enough to finish hers off. I must say I was impressed and happy that yelp had not steered us wrong. We will be back.
1,"The price was right and the suite was amazing. If you want true 5 star i am not sure las vegas even offers it.... Just keep that in mind. Someone posted disappointment that the service was not 5 star and they were actually correct, but the people are nice and helpful, so that has its own value coupled with the views, etc."
0,"I was staying in the neighborhood, and decided to give the place a whirl.  \n\nUpon entering the smell of smoke was really strong, but found a place near the door where it did not seem so bad.  \n\nI was cheerfully met by the server, who was pleasant, but requested that I order everything by numbers, instead of the foods name.  No problem, I agreed.  \n\nI ordered the Octopus and Caesar salad with anchovies.  The salad was really good, the octopus was past chilled, and frozen.  I brushed this off, and ordered the escargot and a glass of zinfandel.  Well, after a few minutes, both showed up, and the zinfandel was a pink one that was cold, so a white or pink zinfandel or some sort of nasty swill, which I tried to get my server's attention, which I waited for for around 10 minutes, and finally walked to the bar to get a glass of red.  \n\nI finished the wine and my escargot, which were OK.  Then the disturbing part began.  I was watching the end of Monday Night football, when I glanced over at the bar and noticed a patron's scrotum hanging out of his underwear while he was stumbling around.  Maybe in Vegas this is acceptable, but somehow in my opinion this mixed with tapas does not jibe.  I was grossed out, and could not leave the place fast enough, and I waited, and waited while trying to make eye contact with my lack of server, who finally signaled to me from afar whether I wanted my bill, which I obviously did, and she obliged.  She then said he had dementia, which I called BS on.  He was drunker than cooter brown, as he had to be helped to get his pants back on.  He was not the only person in here that was plastered, as I noticed many other people stumble by.\n\nMaybe I am wrong, but tapas and a smoking bar full of slot machines and drunks does not really match.  You could not pay me to go into this place again, as it was more than the sad display I witnessed at the end, it was a place that wreaked of smoke, where you are trying to have a nice meal.  If they do not want to alienate their loyal clientele, they should serve tater tots, and spam as when you are that messed up, something that soaks up booze when the staff is clearing over serving the customers would be adequate for their clientele.  \n\nEnter at your own risk......"
1,Great food and very attentive service. Martinis are always awesome. Next time I may try to save room for one of their desserts.
0,"Dined in. Spacious eating room. Where to stand in line to begin was not decipherable without staff direction. Samples of different\nmeats are available. Barbacoa and Carne Asada tacos were flavorful and generous on meat portions. Dining area and service stations were clean. \nNO prices given for drinks, ANY side dishes OR extras. Not even printed on provided hand menu or lit wall menus. A mystery until meal(s) rung up!"
0,there wasnt a huge line outside but i dont remember light or bank ever having a line.  instead masses of people just crowd around the rope hoping their huge boobs or collagen lips will get the bouncers  attention.\n\ni think back in the day when it was called light the club only had one level?  i cant really remember.  now it has three.  a level with the bars and walkways.  then a level with the tables then the bottom with the dacefloor.  all three levels look onto each other though so they are more like balconies. \n\nit just so happened that audrina patridge was also here that night we stumbled in.  didnt see her though the bouncer said she rolled in with a bunch of girls.\n\nso my bf was wearing laceless converse chucks and they let him in.  and another guy in our group was also wearing sneakers but he didnt let him in.  weird discrimination thing.  inside tons of people were wearing sneakers.
1,"While visiting Vegas for a friend's wedding, my hubby & I wanted to try this place after hearing great things about their alcoholic (GASP) shakes. I had a Malibu Barbie - it was OHHHH SOOOO YUMMY. We also had a Salmon Burger and Veggie Falafel Burger. Both were quite good, and reasonably priced. Definitely check it out!"
0,"We arrived around 11pm and we were seated pretty much immediately however, our table top had spilled coffee and food on it, the chairs also had drinks spilled on them, and the floor under our table also had food on it. We asked the hostess for someone to clean the table we waited standing around our table for almost 10 mins, when no one came we cleaned it ourselves with the napkins on the table . Our server wasn't really friendly at all. We were a party of six ppl they brought out food for only two ppl while the rest of us waited another 25-30 mins for our food. the food was ok. We ordered omelets and burgers our food wasn't even hot when received it. Dirty restaurant, ok service and alright food, I won't be back."
1,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n9 Food\n9 Service\n9 Atmosphere\n7 Value\n\nBeing a Monday night it was slow, but regardless our server JD was excellently timed and attentive.  I got the Tommy burger (bacon & bleu cheese) with Cajun Fries and it was deeelicious!  It's a great location with yum yum food and friendly service so I'll return.  The only thing on my wish list would be a more exciting beer list.  The beer list wasn't bland - it had things I hadn't tried - but it wasn't special like Carly's."
0,"Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure."

0,"We ended up here on a night when we were struggling to get in anywhere else so it was more in desperation than in expectation that we paid the \u00a37.50 to get in here.  Oh, how it wasn't value for money.\n\nOnce inside it was busy, the music was decent enough and well decorated throughout.  However, you can get all this elsewhere for far less expense and for \u00a37.50 I half expected it to be paved with gold (though I would have accepted something a bit special).\n\nI guess this place is just for people like me who didn't quite get in elsewhere arriving when every where else was busy and don't want to trek away from Georges Street."
1,Good food fat portions . Kool to have Chino food a phone call away. Delivery is quick . Ppl are nice I've eaten in and it's pretty clean and they seem to enjoy there jobs.
0,"The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \""no pink in the middle,\"" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant."
1,Woke up early morning and decided to wander a little before the bf woke up.  Passed by this place and saw orange juice so I got in line.  I ended up buying orange juice and coconut macaroons.  The macaroons were really tasty...I can't say it was a good combo with orange juice but I was really thankful that I bought a bag of those.  I was munching on those all morning.
0,I just moved over in this area and was trying out different salons. I needed a gel pedicure so i stopped here.  The salon was not as clean as you would liked and they got their tools from a toolbox. Nothing seems to be santized. When doing the pedicure they do not massage your feet. And the gels are so so.  I had a french tip painted on with the gels and I could of done a better job.\n\nWill go try another salon after that.
1,"This arena is fun! Outside area reminds me of downtown Disney with all the music, people and food. Inside is clean but they need to lower the AC a little bit during the hockey game. It was too cold even for my male family members."
0,"I wanted to like this place because the girl was so nice over the phone when I asked if I could bring my dog to the patio. For the place not being all that busy the service was horribly slow. My poor dog and I waited an obscene amount of time on the hot patio for water and beer respectively - we're talking 30+ minutes. Can't comment too much on the food because by the time we finally got our appetizer of chips and guac (which wasn't horrible, but not great) we decided to head elsewhere."
0,I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.
0,"What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality."
1,"Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line."
1,One of my favorite places for breakfast. The chicken fried chicken is amazing! Try it with the hash browns. Your taste buds will be thanking you all day! Really!\n\nAlso note worthy are the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the champion pancake!
1,"Both Parasol Up and Down are great places to go to in order to start a night. I usually go there with friends before hitting one of the clubs at Wynn/Encore or while counting down the time to a reservation at one of the many restaurants at Wynn/Encore. I prefer Parasol down because it's slightly quieter and has a more personal feel, Parasol Up however is open later and is more accessible (not sure if its 24 hours though). In addition to this, both bars have a great selection of spirits to choose from, including brands that aren't available at other higher end bars including Death's Door Gin."
0,"My husband and I came here for a late dinner. We were greeted professionally and waited on with a smile. However, I was not impressed with the food at all. My mother-in-law enjoys this place for lunch and I think her taste is usually spot on, but dinner was disappointing. Dishes were more sweet than savory and were just average; nothing I would go back for. Also, considering there were only a few other tables in the restaurant at the time, our food was served warm and not hot, felt like it may have been \""up\"" for a few minutes before served. I also not a big fan of the decor, felt a little too tropical vacation rental to me."
0,If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction
0,"I enjoy Asian fusion, but this was disappointing.  First, we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Which would be fine if it was worth that wait...\nStarted with a cocktali which was highly recommended by the waitress. Shanghai Tea or something like that? It was nothing special.\nWe ordered some Edamame to start, and it never came. I guess someone forgot. Very unfortunately considering how hungry we were.\n\nI had the orange chicken, which was okay. It was too salty,didn't really taste like orange chicken so much as salt chicken... so I wouldn't get it again. My husband got the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken and he didn't seem blown away by it. I tasted it and it was not that flavorful.\nDessert was probably the best part. We got the banana spring roll, and it was pretty tasty. \nI don't think we will bother going back."
0,"it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food."
1,"I travel often and dine out every meal. I felt obligated to share an experience I had in Phoenix a couple of weeks ago.\nI had a good day of business and wanted to treat myself. I searched for a French restaurant near and was given Christopher's as the nearest. I read the menu on line and decided to go but almost didn't go in after seeing the dirty windows and messy outside dining area. But I thought it was like that because of all the recent rains, so I went on inside.\nUpon entering a dark haired gentleman at the host booth almost made me walk right back out. I was only one person and he seemed agitated about having to figure out where to seat me. He wasn't the host, but later I was able to deduce that he was a waiter with some authority. He was rude, hurried, messy looking and simply not friendly. He sat me near the front and said my waiter would be right here. He then walked over to another man, pointed at me, and walked around the restaurant in his hurried messy way.\nMy waiter walked over and introduced himself as Johnny and asked if I preferred bottled water. This waiter is the only reason I stayed to eat. He was well mannered, efficient. I asked a lot of questions about the menu and he answered them all effectively. He smiled a lot and was attentive to me, a single guy in this restaurant. I often have waiters ignore me because I'm alone but this gentleman was obviously a polished, experienced, professional waiter.\nI asked about several items and decided on blood sausage for my first course and duck 2 ways second course. Johnny clarified with me on my order because I ordered 2 entrees. I thought that was amazing because most waiters would be thrilled with a bigger ticket. He did a perfect job all night in spite of being interrupted by the dark haired waiter. When I asked he suggested \""an old world wine that would pair well with both dishes\"" and he was right again.\nWhen the food arrived it was just like he said it was. Blood sausage circles is the easiest way to describe it. And the duck 2 ways was wonderful as well. After settling in to eat and bread delivered and the waiter calming me down I did notice a well run kitchen and nice fine dining set up on tables.\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys wonderfully made French food. I would also suggest you ask for Johnny as your waiter. When I visit again in a couple weeks that is what I'm going to do."
1,Easy to enjoy such clean fresh food. This restaurant would be a great addition to any city.  It is wonderful to have restaurant owners who are responding to our community wanting more organic and healthier choices.
0,Not to happy we need a good Chinese food place out here. Maybe that's what it is. If you go you will feel like you wasted your money after you eat.  I guess it is what it is.  I hope we get some Asians out here to open up some businesses in some of these empty spaces that are all over. We need good food out here!!!!!
0,"I purchased an $8 Groupon good for $16 for this Quiznos.  You'd think it should be pretty simple for someone of High School graduate age to ring up an order, subtract $16 and then give me the correct total, right?  WRONG!!!!!  They took off $7.36 pre-tax and then $8 post-tax.  The entire $16 should have been subtracted PRE-TAX like a coupon (in fact, like their combo discount).  But no!  Their method gyps the Groupon user out of an additional $1.34 on a $16 Groupon, on top of their outrageous prices because they're located in a strip casino food court.  STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,"Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates."
0,"Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,"
1,"This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)"
0,"More like BOTCHanal Buffet..\n\nLet me start by saying that I don't usually take the time to review things on yelp, because I feel other people will usually do a good job of posting accurate reviews.  With that said, I usually write a review when something is really good, really bad, or I disagree with the majority of reviews.  Here's my review:\n\nTHIS PLACE IS OVERRATED!!!\n\nI've been to buffets that are 50% cheaper and have the same quality, selection, and better service.  Granted, we had a very responsive busboy and server.  But man, the hosts and hostesses could not count or prioritize to save their lives.  We ended up waiting 265 minutes total.  Then when we got to the front of the line, the \""joke-stess\"" called forward a party behind us.  She told us we would only have to wait 2 more minutes, which turned out to be 30 more minutes.  We had to complain to the manager in order to be seated.  And finally, when the rope line was opened for us to go sit down, the hostess miscounted the number of people in our group by a large amount.  Whether for lack of attention or inability to count, they obviously were not running the place competently.  \n\nSimilar to what another reviewer stated, we got to our table to find that there were plenty of open tables that would have accommodated our group.  We also saw that they seated a party with less people than ours at a table meant for 8.  \n\nO_O\n\nOk enough of the introductions--let's get on to the food.\n\nMany people seemed crazy about the crab legs.  I guess many people go to buffets only for the crab.  I go for everything.  \n\nTypically, buffet food is a little stale because it kinda sits there for a while.  For the price this place charges, you would think their food would be a little different......  not the case.    this food is your usual crusty-edged garbage that results from being over exposed to warming lamps.  \n\nThe variety of options was also not impressive.  Even if there were items that are not normally at a traditional buffet, people didn't choose them.  They just remained in the heating lamps drying out.  My guess is that there is a reason some dishes are not typically served at buffets.   \n\nOverall, this place felt on par with other buffets that charge around 20-25 dollars.  \nSave your money, time, and the headache for something else!!\n\nP.S.- BE PREPARED FOR ANNOYING PEOPLE TAKING CELLPHONE PICTURES OF ALL THE FOOD."
0,"When I booked the Thanksgiving buffet, I did not have high expectations for the food.  I read the Yelp reviews and assumed the food would be acceptable.  Unfortunately, even that expectation was not achieved.\n\nI wanted a place that served a fairly traditional meal (which unfortunately left out most of the fine dining takes on Thanksgiving) without waiting in line at one of the mega buffets.  Other than the Italian cured meats and bread, the food was poor.  The carved turkey and pork were dry and lacked any flavor.  The yams were terrible.  The Italian entr\u00e9es were ok, but nothing special.\n\nIn all, my worst meal in Vegas."
1,"On one of our many trips to Vegas, Minh and I met up with our friends Ashley and her fianc\u00e9 Taj for a late night dinner. This place came highly recommended by Kent D. Seeing the amazing reviews and all the yummi photos and not to mention they have Sangria, I was in! \n\nWhen I told Ashley where we were going she was overly excited, come to find out this is one of her favorite places to eat at. \n\nNow, parking here is hard, you will be making circles in the parking lot trying to stalk people coming out of the restaurant. Give yourself more than enough time is all I can suggest. A lot of their clientele are people pre-gaming before a night of drinking and dancing so it will be busy until about 11:00pm. They do not take reservation on Friday and Saturday nights either. \n\nMinh and I were the first to arrive; we put our name in and had a seat outside. We were told it would be no more than a 20-30 minute wait for a party of four.\nOur friends arrived just in time as our name was called about 10mins later. I think we only waited a total of 15mins or so which is awesome considering the place was packed when we arrived.\n\nMost of the staff was nice; we were lead to the back of the restaurant, which was fine for us. The place is loud and it can be hard to hear each other, so do not be surprised if people look at you if you are talking loudly so someone at your table so that they can hear you! \n\nOur server came by and took our drink order I had a White Sangria, while Ashley had a Mojito (which btw is super strong).\n\nThe menu is impressive with what they have, wanted to order one of everything just to try it! Ashley made suggestions on what was the BEST; all her suggestions were true to her word too!\n\nI started out with trying (and ooo btw the White Sangria was prefect, strong and tasty... can I get a pitcher?!) \n\n-Ceviche of Shrimp-tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla \n-Steak and Mushroom Skewers- grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction\n-Ahi Tuna Skewer-mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze\n\nI was going to rate this with a perfect five but towards the end our server got sloppy and started forgetting orders. I ordered Empanada's and as the rest of my friends and boyfriend received their food; I was left sipping on my sangria wondering where my darn empanadas were. Well maybe they take some time to make I thought. Therefore, I let it go not thinking much until Minh realized that I still did not get my order. \nWe tried to get our server attention, which took some flagging down. She finally came over and we asked her about my order. She stared at us blankly and said, \""Did you order Empanada's?\"" I said yes I did. \""oh, I didn't put your order in\"" When she walked back to the kitchen, I guess they were sitting there for awhile she came back and said that someone must have put the order in because they were sitting in the pickup line. Knowing that they were sitting for a while, I did not have a good feeling to eat them, so I told her never mind. She made kind of a stink about it so instead we asked for a box to take it with us.\n\nWould I come back again, yes! It's rare for me to say that if I had semi crappy service, but the food and sangria is just damn good!"
1,"Ate lunch here on 10/8/13 and was very impressed. Ordered the Tree of Life, side of baba ganoush, and some sort of off-the-menu vegan, pumpkin/banana smoothie. LOVED the freshness of all the ingredients, LOVED the Tree of Life (even though I am not a vegetarian or vegan), LOVED the friendly counter service and friendly delivery to our table outside, and I LOVE what The Center is doing for the community as a whole. Sign me up for any establishment that is working to make things better in our town."
1,"A great garage with a great owner.  George goes above and beyond to provide quality service, fair prices, and detailed explanations of what's wrong with your car.  A recent experience demonstrates the honesty of this shop.  I had some engine lights turn on and auto zone ran a diagnostic that suggested some larger problems but after taking the car to George I found out that it turned out to just be a dying battery.  There is no other place in town I'll take my vehicles."
1,The Bellagio is one of the nicest hotels in Las Vegas. It is an elegant structure that is beautiful inside and out.\n\nMy favorite place to dine inside the Bellagio is Yellowtail. It is located near the valet on Flamingo Rd. There are other amazing dining opportunities all throughout the hotel. There is also a great bakery over by the shopping area where all the flowers are.\n\nThe rooms and suites are amazing. They have great views of the Westside of the Valley and of the Strip. The food from room service is better than many of the restaurants that I have eaten at on the Strip.\n\nThey have an amazing fountain and light show at night that you can view from the strip or from any of the surrounding area.\n\nThe casino itself if very large and they have a very nice high limit room with a very comfortable high limit lounge. There are also a couple of nightlife Venus to choose from.\n\nI really like the fact that you can actually walk out the back of the hotel over to City Center (Vadra).\n\nI highly recommend frequenting the Bellagio.
0,"We were looking for good Italian food and decided to try this place based on the reviews. The place was surprisingly packed for a rainy evening so we decided to wait the 20 minutes for a table. We ordered drinks while we waited and were a little disappointed that an $8 glass of wine was not filled at least half way. We were walked to a table that the hostess warned us was wet and we had to ask for it to be dried. Once we were seated and ordered, our very small salads came quickly but we had no silverware or napkins. Eventually we were able to let our server know and she fixed the problem.\n\nThe live music was fun but, a bit loud. This is definitely a family friendly environment as children were running between the tables going outside to play and marching back in between the tables while we were attempting to eat. This seemed to be the norm with the staff and the patrons. I have never seen such a thing.\n\nThe food was alright, it really was in dire need of some serious seasoning. My spaghetti tasted like pasta with tomato sauce and the chicken parmesan tasted like it came from the freezer. His small portion of chicken marsala was thin over some broccoli. The cannoli  had a strange flavor and the nuts on it made our mouths dry, not good. \n\nOverall it was an alright experience, no where near all the great reviews it received. I don't know that we will be back.  Not a date night type of place."
1,"Saw K.D. Lang here a few months back.  Very easy to review the venue.  Too much cement in the interiors, big but not too big theater ensuring great seats for all, and top notch venue sound.\n\nThe only drawback and this is a BIG DRAWBACK:  the night we attended quality folding seats were installed where I guess a dance floor typically is.  These folding seats had proper cushioning and we plenty comfortable to sit in, but --\n\n-- the seats were WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.  Like LAWSUIT close.  I paid to be in the eight row (Yay!) but person to my left and to my right were thigh to thigh, shoulder to shoulder, and none of us were fat.  People in these rows soon figured out that if you but your arm around your significant other this allowed enough room to not be touching the shoulders of strangers.\n\nThis isn't about cooties, lol.   When you're seated that close you can't applaud the artist without hitting the people next to you.  I'm not kidding.  It's THAT close.\n\nHad Lang not been so riveting I'd have demanded a partial refund from the box office."
0,"It happens every season of top chef.  Some perfectly amazing chef forgets to salt his dish (or over/undercooks it, etc..) and we go from an awesome idea to getting booted off the show. \n\nThat's how I felt at THBJ.  A breakfast bowl that grossly lacked salt.  Potatoes where half were cooked perfectly and half were undercooked.  And, oh yeah, putting hot oily food in a plastic container so that the oil eats through the plastic and you don't realize that half your food is essentially touching the (not terribly clean) table.  YUCK!!!! \n\nAfter reading that last line, you might wonder: Why in the world did she give it two whole stars?  What can I say, i'm a sucker for a place called a breakfast joint.  (But, who creates a breakfast joint that doesn't serve breakfast all day?  Really?)"
1,"I am sad to see all the negative reviews....though it seems that a good majority is for the sushi, which, I do not eat. \n\nI am pretty much IN LOVE with the Chicken Katsu here. I order it with a side of teriyaki (I like to dip my chicken Katsu in the teriyaki sauce, then the Katsu sauce for a sweet and savory flavor) \n\nThe Tempura is always great, we get a mixed starter. \n\nThe miso is tasty. \n\nI love the little salad they serve with the peanut dressing, its the first thing I eat off my plate. So good! \n\nI didn't give them 5 stars because this last time we went (Tuesday night) our waitress was a total space Cadette. She looked like she was barely old enough to work. Had zero personality. Just wasn't feeling her at all. \n\nOther then that, this is one of my go to spots when I have a deep need for some Chicken Katsu. I have had this dish at other restaurants and none come close to Shoguns."
0,"Let's be real. You're only here because \n\n-You don't really have options late at night in Terminal 3, but you NEED tequila.\n\n-You're not from the southwest, so this is the best Mexican food you're gonna have.\n\nBeer prices are off the charts, even compared to many other airports, AND the selection blows. I get margaritas because I feel less bad paying around $10 for those, and they're at least decent. \n\nEven the chips and salsa are lame...you don't get enough salsa and the chips are ice cold. I've endured the tacos as well and weren't impressed. \n\nThe options are WAY cooler in other parts of the airport. I swear, Phoenix has better than this to offer."
1,"This place is sooooo good!  And the customer service and delivery is great!  Win-win.  I had been to the location at the airport and was telling my husband about it, so we decided to order some for delivery and went back for a carry out order a week later.  The garlic knots are a must for us, they are awesome - make sure to ask for extra sauce if you are a marinara fan like we are.  As far as pizzas, the white pizza and bbq chicken are amazing!  We are going to try the buffalo chicken pizza next time around.  I highly recommend this place.  Also, if you check your mailers, you will find coupons for them pretty frequently - we had a $5 off $25 that we used this last time.  So if you are on the fence, use a coupon.  You will be glad you tried them!"
1,Always great to be back. It's a lot like eating at a Moroccan friend's house with a kick ass personal chef.
0,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
0,This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
0,"It doesn't matter what I write in this review. If you've never tried it before and you find yourself in Pittsburgh, you're going to try Primanti Brothers. I tried it despite reading all the reviews telling me how mediocre it is. I needed to try it for myself. And I'm glad I did. Now I know I need to never come back here again. \n\nThis place is just one big NO. I have no idea how it has become so popular. I really do not get it. I got the pastrami and cheese. This was the sandwich: a slice of regular white bread, three slices of tomatoes, two tablespoons of bland cole slaw, 2 pounds of french fries, one tiny little slice of cheese, about 3-4 slices of pastrami, and another slice of regular white bread. As you can tell from my description, there was not enough meat, non-existent cheese, and way too many fries. The only thing on my sandwich with any flavor was the pastrami (that was actually pretty good and what earned this place a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star). But there just wasn't enough pastrami and the signature fries and cole slaw were not very good. \n\nMy sister ordered the cheesesteak, which is really just a cheeseburger. We also ordered the Smallman St. Fries, which are fries with cheese, bacon, chili, and sour cream. They sound delicious right? They looked delicious too. I was super excited to eat them. Sadly, like my sandwich, they did not live up to the hype. I think it was the chili, but I did not enjoy them. \n\nThis place was crazy crowded and it's clearly a Pittsburgh staple so maybe it's just me. It's sad really because the sandwiched have so much potential to be amazing!"
1,"Excellent salads! You can't beat this level of quality, and service for these prices and convenience. They were even nice to our dog that they saw in the car. They are restaurant quality."
1,"Solid beers on tap (dogfish head 90 min, chimay) great cocktails and excellent service. \n\nThank you Daniel."
1,"Incredible!!  I have been craving Korean food like crazy and this place make those cravings 10 times worse.  First, the atmosphere is great...it's mellow with some kpop playing in the background.  And the drinks are fantastic as well...my favorite, by far, was the yogurt soju cocktails.  They're sweet and super light, but you'll definitely feel the effects fast.  Order the pitcher, it's a great deal.\n\nBut the food is the real star.  We started off with seafood dduk boki (spicy seafood with korean ricecake tubes) and it was super fresh and delicious.  Also, the owners were kind enough to send us over a pot of free odeng (fishcakes in a bubbling hot broth) and it was sooo good, especially dipped in the special soy sauced based sauce.  We also ordered the korean chicken wings (sticky, spicy, amazing), the kimchi fried rice (the best I've ever had, next to mom's), the spicy bbq pork (really smokey and a little spicy...super good), the cold noodles, and the bi bim bap.  Everything was incredible and we left stuffed.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, the service was excellent, and did I mention how good the food is??\n\nCheck it out, asap!"
1,"Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I've been visiting over the course of the last few years. The menu has changed over the years with a lot of new options provided. My favorite is the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size but still retains its grandness but what can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants? \n\nTheir chicken is solid, so is their chicken tenders. I think I ordered their chicken burger once as well and it was solid. All in all, good grub, for a chain.\n\nHowever, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and probably are less healthy than the fries.\n\nThey have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P\n\nThe Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.\n\nService is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.\n\nAll in all, a nice place to eat at, if you select things you know are good."
0,"The service at Sushi Ko was terrible.  Our waitress was rude.  I think we were inconveniencing her by needing things like tea or plates or sushi...  We tried to get her attention, then we tried to get anyone's attention to bring us plates and little bowls for our soy sauce.  We eventually retrieved our own plates.  When we asked about the bowls for soy sauce, we were told they \""were out\"", even though we could see a little stack of them in the restaurant.\n\nThe sushi itself was acceptable, if forgettable.  We had a rainbow roll, spicy something or other, and tuna sashimi. The rolls were a little loose and hard to eat.  \n\nI won't be eating there again unless they make some staffing changes."
0,"Hello everyone, \n\nI had to create a Yelp account just to inform people how HORRIBLE this hotel really is. Where to start. We got in on a Friday, when we got to the room it smelled horrible. The TP holder was under the sink in the corner with TP rolls sitting on the counter. They must of been to lazy to pick it up and put it back. After I fixed that I sat down to relax and watch some TV.. Well that was a JOKE! I turned on the TV and every channel was staticky and couldn't watch... Yes, I had a nice view of the pool. But as I opened the sliding door to the balcony (which you could only take one step out on and no room to move) the door almost FELL off. I had to catch it before it went over the railing...... The carpets were filthy!! Location SUCKS! After the horrible weekend at hooters I was so glad to get home to a nice clean environment.. I get a call from hooters saying we got charged an extra $300 for the \""Damages\"" . WORST HOTEL EVER DO NOT STAY HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND UPGRADE TO THE MOTEL 6 NEXT DOOR."
0,"This buffet was so so on a Saturday evening. I can't even recall the food I ate because none of it was impressive. \n\nThis buffet is cheaper than a lot of buffets in Vegas. There's a good amount of selection here - someone for everyone almost. \n\nThe cocktail shrimp is peel yourself and the beef ribs are ginourmous! The dessert was watery and lacking taste - it's usually my favorite part of the meal! Ice cream was good though. \n\nI would only recommend this buffet if you have a coupon, want a quick bite to eat (there's no line), or you have the 24 hour pass and this is the closest place to go."
0,What a downer...ended the evening here...food...just regular ole bar food...nothing special...drinks just average...water tasted good and fairly priced...
0,Been going to this car wash for a few years now. It gets slower and slower every time. Sat in waiting area for an hour last time. Not going back. 15 workers and its terrible
1,A delightful place with a unique feature. The revolving bar goes around the tables and allows customers to take what they want when they want it. Kiku Sushi allows you to choose the sushi you want without having to order and entire plate of 6-8 pieces. You pick up the plate from the bar which gives you 2-6 pieces of sushi per plate. There is less chance of you wasting the food and a better chance of you to get only what you love and try new things. The service is friendly and helpful. They all take great care of the customer. Another great thing is that of your sushi gets taken up by other patrons you can always just ask the waitress to have the chef make you your order instead of waiting for the dish to come around. They really want to make sure everyone has a great and filling experience.
0,I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.\n\nAs I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out. \n\nDecided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita. \n\nI had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.\n\nWon some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat
1,"I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley."
0,"We arrived and were immediately greeted by the overly-polite waitress who seated us immediately. Noticed we were one of 2 patrons, but since it was 3:00 PM, we thought we arrived before the dinner rush.\n\nWaitress gave us the menu and as we looked it over, we couldn't make sense of it. When we asked about certain items, waitress had a hard time finding it on the menu. Unfortunately, she was trying too cater to us to closely, as in body space. When she spoke she inadvertently spit over the wife's shoulder.  Eh.\n\nReviewing the menu became more annoying, especially since they didn't know where to find items on their menu. We fought through it and ordered the all you can eat lunch for the kids. I ordered the sashimi lunch.\n\nLooked around the place and liked the 2 flat screens so sat and watched ESPN a little bit until the food arrived. The sashimi was okay, nothing amazing. The rolls were just okay. Fish was somewhat fresh, on the border of stale. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThe all-you-can eat lunch was $20.95 per person, too pricey for a family of five. We know of other Vegas sushi spots that charge less with better quality food.  They need to work on their menu being more simple with an easier font to read. Maybe put more pictures to cater to the less informed sushi patron. \n\nSince this is a sushi place in the heart of the Vegas suburbs, I don't see them taking business away from the other notable Sushi places near them. I hope they make it, but something tells me they may struggle for sometime.\n\nI'm being kind at 2 stars."
1,"My wife and I were out shopping on Saturday and as is our custom we were looking for a new and interesting lunch spot.\n\nShe spotted Hiromaru Fusion Ramen and said \""That's it!\"".\n\nThe simple yet colorful decor was bright and refreshing compared to some ramen houses I have been in.  The waitress was quick to bring our drinks and explain some menu items to my wife.\n\nI ordered the TATE-YAMA RAMEN which was truly a mountain of vegetables, sprouts, and delicious ramen.  My wife ordered TONKOTSU CURRY TSUKEMEN and it looked and smelled delicious.  Both dishes were beautifully prepared and presented.\n\nWe only had the ramen dishes listed but saw many other interesting meals being served to our fellow diners.  We will visit again to try out other menu items!\n\nHighly recommend Hiromaru Fusion Ramen for a great meal with a little twist."
0,"I got the French dip with slaw. The order was to go but it took a while to get out. The meat was pretty bland and I didn't get the correct side, potato salad instead of slaw. I was expecting more."
1,Food was excellent. It is good for casual sushi but service could be more professional.
1,"best ramen i've had. i always order their chasu miso ramen, but have also tried the extra spicy and deluxe. i have only tried their miso broth because its so good.  the miso broth is very flavorful and comes out hot, their pork is thick cut and break apart in ur chopstick tender and the noodles are delicious, a great texture. definitely a regular here. better than monta, anime ramen, or anywhere i've eaten in the bay area, hawaii, etc. nothing can compare! Im sitting at home craving it right now but can't have it yet because they're not open for another 4 hours!"
0,Very minimal selection. Small seating area. Not many bikes either - mainly Felt. If you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse. If you want bikes go to a bike house.
1,Truly is one of the best lounges I have experienced.  The new SFO lounge has nothing on this one.  The DFW lounge is quite good too.  Keep up the great work.  Please keep the brownies.
0,"I give it one star because the fries were pretty good. A little soggy, but seasoned well. The Chicken Fingers were ok. Got the Cajun flavor and it was hot sauce with Cajun sprinkled on top. Not special. When you walk in it was very awkward. No music. No TV. Dead silence. Wasn't greeted until a couple moments. Only one employee. She took the order and cooked it. She was very nice. Just.. So quiet in there. If your going to try this place. Take fries to go."
1,"It's late, I've had a very pleasant evening, and I find myself with pre-bedtime munchies. I'd cleaned my kitchen earlier and am loathe to fill my sink with more dishes, so after commiserating with a buddy about an acute lack of late night Thai in my neighborhood I search Yelp for places still open when Oliveo's Pizza pops up. Generally favourable reviews, so who am I to deny myself a potentially tasty late-night pie?\n\nI'm happy to see that I can order online, so I pull up their clunky but overall serviceable interface and toss in an order for a pizza and some root beer within a few minutes. Also, no ridiculous fees for pithy shit like ordering online or using a credit card  like the ones Gus's tacks on to their bill. A big plus. One oddity, the quoted delivery time is nearly two hours away, but when I get my confirmation email it seems that their whole system is an hour ahead so I don't have to hold back the munchie demons until damn near 3am. Quirky, but nothing wrong.\n\nSo here I sit, waiting for my pizza, I'll write the rest of the review after it shows up and gets in mah belleh.\n\nWell then. Color me pleased, the pizza showed up earlier than expected and is incredibly tasty. I especially love the crust, not enough places do it right. So now I have a late night pizza joint, I'm calling this a big win all around."
1,"We randomly walked into the restaurant, after a long day.  We couldn't find something that used to be on the menu, but the waiter still placed our order.  Ended up ordering our own version of \""Surf and Turf\"" - an 8 oz filet mignon and a lobster tail, with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Was incredible disappointed with the salad.  It looked like someone just opened a bag of iceburg lettuce and dropped it in a bowl.  The lobster tail was a bit over cooked and super chewy.  But the filet mignon and mashed potatoes were amazing, but I'm also and meat and potato person. :-)  I still like the intimacy and classiness of the restaurant.  It might have been because we came in so close to closing time.  Been there before with better food, so will definitely give them another chance."
1,"Heard about this place through many channels, most currently through word of mouth, but as far back as the episode of Bourdain's travels. \n\nI travel to Montreal a lot and this is the first time with my fiance, so I had to go somewhere nice... Now on to the good stuff. \n\nThe only reason why its not a perfect 5 star is because of the missed delivery of my appetizer, its more 4.5 stars, but yelp doesnt have a 4.5... so I rounded up :) \n\nRatings & Review \n- Food - (5 Star) \n- Service - (4.5 star) Just because of the missed appetizer, my beers came flowing perfectly \n- Decor - (5 star) \n- Cost - (5 star) its French people.. come on \n\nFood Had: \n- Foie Gras Cromesquis - This was weird, I never had foie gras, but this stuff is amazing, its foie gras cubes battered and deep fried, when you pop it in your mouth, it bursts with the best flavor I've ever experienced, is this foie gras? I am in love then! \n\n- Piglet Roast - Sliced pork, nothing much else to say, I was not too fond of this, pretty bland \n\n- Fries (in duck fat) - They actually have a guy devoted to just making fries, he throws how the cold ones and make them to order, tastes amazing \n\n- Duck in a can - WOW amazing, it took a while to arrive because it needs to cool down, but when you bite into it... OMG amazing!, I just can't see myself eating the duck skin... it was pretty thick...\n\nTip: (1) Reservation is a must (2) Sit at the bar, the first 4 seats are awesome, you see all the action in the kitchen! (3) If you sit at the bar, wear something you don't mind at the end of the night smelling like the kitchen!"
0,"Would be nice if the hotel had separate line for guests staying at the hotel.\nEven nicer if workers came out and asked if people were purchasing all day pass, regular tickets or hotel guests...\n\nTried it twice here. Brunch and Dinner. For breakfast I liked the lox and fruits. Other than that everything was a typical breakfast buffet (pancakes, eggs, bacon....plus long lines. When they changed it to lunch menu, which was behind their schedule, they had a vege station and on the other side meat, poultry, soups, salads etc. It was limited selection. We got to sit towards the back \""wooden glass room\"" where sunlight was good and view of a pool was available. \n\nDinner looked the same as brunch menu with the exception of crabs: snow crab legs or pre-cut crab legs. Along with the salmon I tasted I only had the crabs to eat. This time we were seated in the room towards the entrance. I noticed after awhile that this room had the loud crying kids, asians and latino's. If another party left and was seated it was the same race as the previous... and the help here were busy like crazy Just 2 ladies for the whole room. They served and bussed the tables, unlike the nicer rooms.\n\nAs for satisfying your sweet tooth. If you don't like dark Chocolate, good luck. 90% of their desserts contain dark chocolate + one dry looking carrot cake. So I just left with some vanilla chocolate ice cream from the machine in a waffle cone.\n\nAfter comparing where we were seated I can say that the people towards the front of the entrance have more work than the people towards the glass window area towards the back. The atmosphere changes as well from a Denny's room to a Tommy Bahamas room as you walk further towards the glass rooms. With that I guess if you know how they try to distinguish guests.\n\nWe have enjoyed other buffets than this place. They can do way better for the price that you pay to stay here."
1,They have a great happy hour and the staff is awesome.
0,"The steak was perfect. Everything else was terrible. I'm going to try to explain why I am only giving this place a 2 star review. \n\n1st - we made reservations for 7:30 for 5 people on a Sunday night. We arrived at 7:29 and were told it would just be a few minutes... 40 minutes later we got seated at a table that was meant for 4. What is the point of a reservation if there is no table reserved for you??\n\n2nd - the waitress was opening a bottle of wine and accidentally cut her finger. Instead of excusing herself to deal with the problem, she pulled a bandaid out of her wallet and applied it at the table. I don't think that's very sanitary. It's also gross. \n\n3rd - the food came out 2 hours after we ordered. They forgot 2 sides. They also served our steaks with what I'm 95% sure was microwaved vegetables. If I'm paying $40 dollars for a steak, I'm expecting some fresh vegetables to go along with it. \n\nThe only respite was that they forgot to charge us for our bar tab from before they sat us. This is the only reason I am not giving them 1 star. \n\nThey do 1 thing right. The 1 thing that they need to do right. The steak. Everything else: the waiters, the management, the other food... Just horrendous."
0,"THIS PLACE is nothing but SUCKS!\n\n I ordered the dry chicken, microwaveable-\""Mexican\"" rice bowl and it was disgusting. The veggies were mushy and over \""saut\u00e9ed\"" almost drowning in oil and the fake, industrial-tasting flour tortillas are so gross. \n\nTo make things worst, I get two Perrier waters and it came to $8 for both! NO THANKS! And when I tried to return them, Ms. Patty who rang me up, gave me so much attitude. I could care less about it, I am not paying $8 for carbonated water. She said \""I have to get the manager *rolls eyes, gives me the \""you little punk look\""*, and I said \""i have an hour layover, so I'm not going anywhere\""\n\nHorrible experience and I beg you, please just go elsewhere. I ended up getting free water from SBUX, instead of throwing away $8. Hopefully  LAS gets better food and soon.\n\nJust go to the slot machines and make better use of your $$$ there."
0,I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!
0,RESTAURANT INFLEXIBLE. Reserved table for wine pairing dinner months in advance with the understanding that one of the party didn't eat meat. \nTwo days before the dinner we were sent a menu which contained no options other than meat. The chef refused to alter her menu to add a non-meat option. \nChef too self-important to accommodate clientele.
0,"i'll just say a quick word about Green Valley's buffet --- absolutely over-priced for the dinner buffet at $15.99 a person, but this is a good lower-scale buffet. some good entrees... teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour fish (that's a new one to me) most of the time, it's just sweet and sour pork and chicken, in fact, the Asian section was the best part of the buffet. desserts were not fresh enough, but edible. the only dining problem: our server disappeared til the end of our visit. another buffet for the \""nothing-special-but-an-acceptable-buffet\"" category. still though, the biggest turn-off is that this buffet is over-priced: dinner - $16.00 a person. otherwise, passable"
1,"I love that this Dunkin' Donuts has a drive-thru. I wish other Dunkin' Donuts would follow their lead. This location is very convenient for me as it's near a gas station and just off the freeway. Somebody said they had slow service here. I've never had that problem. Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one. This place is staffed by responsible teenages. It's a clean location with clean bathrooms."
0,"It pains me to say it, but there's a reason I don't go here anymore.  \n\nWent there for the first time in months recently and was seriously disappointed.  My husband's fried fish banh mi had one seriously tiny piece of fish on it, and my nem nuong banh mi was similarly lacking in meat.  Their banh mi have never been especially generous in the meat department, but this time it was pretty sad.  It was mostly made of pickled veggies.  In comparison, Black Dog's sandwiches are about $8 ($3 more than most of the banh mi) and they're huge and come with a side.  I'd rather pay a bit more and get a better sandwich.\n\nTwo stars because the banh mi my sister got (creamy pork) was better and the service is always good."
1,"I like this store, plenty of space to walk, lots of different produce, organic cosmetics and supplements. If I would have more money I would shop only there definitely."
0,"This used to be one of our favorite sushi spots, up until recently. We've ate here quite a few times but the service is their downfall. We went on a Thursday around 4 and received horrible service, considering they were not that busy. It took us about 30minutes to receive our appetizers, fine. But after already having been there 45 minutes the waitress still hadn't come back to take our order! Appalling, since she had walked by our table about 10times and couldn't be bothered to at least take our order! We were getting frustrated, especially since they give your table a time limit. \nSo we stopped the manager as she walked by and made her aware of the situation. Instead of taking charge and handling the situation (umm.. Hello? Take our order!) she just kept saying sorry sorry and walked away. Incompetent! \nWe walked out of there. As soon as we hit the parking lot the manager now wanted to handle it and offer discounts or whatever  she could do to make us come back in. Needless to say, we are never coming back here. \nIt's a shame. The menu is great and I like the fact that they will make custom orders. Also they have a kids menu which is nice, but I was shocked to find out my 8 year old would have to pay adult price for AYCE!!!"
0,"Employees seem to outnumber patrons by 4 to one but \""service\"" is still grumpy and slow.    Food is OK but nothing worth returning for.  Three stars are extremely generous when you consider the overly expensive prices.  The property and setup is very nice, this place has a lot of potential but currently they are not making it work."
0,We stopped here on a whim while going through the Miracle Miles shops as it looked like a nice place to dine and unwind. We had the Spinach Artichoke appetizer that was good but a little pricey($9) for the size that you get. Next came our dinner....Margherita Pizza($9)....totally worthless meal... sauce and cheese baked on a tortilla/flatbread....gross!....Filet Mignon($21)...very tender but had absolutely zero taste!!! Service was good and the drinks were good but with so many options in Vegas you could really do so much better as it was probably our worst meal on the trip.
0,"Horrible experience with Dr Lisa (didn't catch her last name). I've used this vet before and I like Dr Winn. But I won't go back after the way I was just treated by a business that potentially would've received $500 or more from me. \n   Dee at the front desk has a terrible, unfriendly, unwelcoming attitude.  The vet wanted ME to decide on a course of treatment which made me feel like the reason I waited in the exam room for almost an hour was because she was Googling the condition on the internet based on what I told the young lady at check in!!\n   Ultimately, I didn't like the way she grabbed my docile, calm cat to begin the exam. Then when I (yes, ME) wasn't sure if the infection was bladder or uterine related she got very condescending and unprofessional. I put my cat back in her carrier, walked out and checked Yelp in the car for another vet and made an appointment elsewhere for later today. I wish Dr Winn would clean house. Jess, at the front desk, is a sweetheart. His business could be so much better without the dead weight."
1,"Now's the time to get your shopping on - they have some awesome gift boxes at discounted prices (if you were to add up the cost of each individual product, it would be way more expensive) and bonus - for every tub of the Cr\u00e8me de Corps sold, 100% of the proceeds go to Leucan. How can you lose? \n\nFor my general review, see below!"
0,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced of my life. We had a party of four ordered probably close to 140 dollars worth of food and seen hardly any of it. We place our order at 544pm on January 1st. At approx 605 waiter comes with a pound of crawfish and a pound of snow crab. We wait until 630 still 2 of the remaining people yet to see they're food. I call the waitress over she says I'm sorry were really busy\"". My response was I understand that I'm in customer service myself but when another party of 4 comes in 20 minutes after is and orders 10 lbs of crawfish and gets served before I even see my lb I ordered over 35 minutes ago that's a problem. I've never experienced that bad of service and this was one of my wife's favorite spots this is truly disappointing."
0,"Part of staying at the Aria Hotel is that we were given $100 for resort credits that we could use daily. So, instead of wasting extra bucks, we ended up trying this buffet place. The service was poor, they were really slow in getting our drinks, and the food was way too dry and not much choice. Oh well, what do you expect for free food? I'd suggest to go to another hotel if you plan not to ruin your taste buds to get nicer brunch menu!"
1,"Probably the best AYCE sushi spot in Vegas! Love that it's open late night, and that they have daily specials. It's also great that they don't give an abundance of rice and small cuts of fish. Seemed like most of their rolls were amazing (and they let you do half orders for AYCE so you can sample more!) \n\nMust try: \nSalon Belly: buttery goodness!\nGrilled pork belly: delicious fatty goodness\nYuzu Sorbet: tangy, refreshing goodness\n\nI highly recommend sitting at the bar is possible, you'll get your nigiri and rolls much quicker."
0,"I only chose this place because of the great reviews here but my experience was not good at all. I actually went maybe 4 weeks ago. me n my friend went and got in right away. the place was dead. Pablo did the massage and I had a groupon for an hour massage but between me n my frend it added up to an hour. so basically I was ripped off by 30 minutes. at the end I didnt say anything because I knew I wasn't coming back and not only that but he has a way to make u feel uncomfortable and the entire time he is massaging u, he will not stop talking. I thought I came for and hour of relaxation but he jst kept talking and talking. and of course for only 30 mins. he seems like he believes he knows what be is doing and what he is talking about but I dont buy it. his skills speak for themselves wen he only rubbed oil all over me without putting in the smallest of pressure anywhere. then he had the audacity to tell me that nxt time he can give me a discount and massage me an hour for $50. I had paid less than $50 for an hour and I didnt even get that!! I tipped him well because he did offer me tea, fruit etc. but he really did not deserve it at all but I am always a good tipper. waste of time and money. not to mention I didn't enjoy how many personal questions he asked and how he wouldn't keep quiet during the massage. an overall unfortunate experience.  very disappointed, never coming back. I did find another more professional and amazing LMT at episage wellness center, been goin there now ever since."
0,"Oh my god. that's worst service. The staff is not very polite. I feel very bad, food is OK, one star, I won't go back to eat."
1,"Love this place...been for brunch and dinner several times since it opened, highly recommend the pancakes and bacon, the street tacos, the chicken mole and paella.  The otro salad is excellent, as are the mojitos.."
0,"Saigon Pho Falls Flat\n\nYears ago, my husband and i went to Saigon Pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of Bun Hanoi.  Once we quit the choir, and found Cyclo, Saigon Pho was no longer on the radar screen.  Last night, i craved a bowl of pho, and wanting to mix it up a bit, we thought we'd visit the old haunt.\n\nWell, disappointing.  The Pho Tai was flat in flavor, greasy and very, very average.  the \""salad\"" consisted of a handful of bean sprouts, a lemon wedge, one basil leaf (!) and a sickly branch of couple day old mint leaves.  \n\nIt was sustenance, but not a great food treat.  \n\nwe'll be moving on."
1,"Best pool party in Vegas hands down. Back in the day Rehab was the spot now this is the go to. Great crowd, great Dj's."
0,"Would you pay $150 to have one of your buddies tell you about his favorite music and play half of songs that he didn't write on his guitar?  If so, you'll love this show.  However, if you're like me and expect a high energy throw down concert (solo or not) when you pay $150 and travel to VEGAS...you'll be disappointed.  Showing up in jeans, dirty boots, a hoodie and a baseball cap to a show that you made people pay $150 for in my opinion is rude.  Now if this had been a $35 show, I'd be writing a different review, I still would have been let down, but not as much.\n\nThe show starts with Garth coming out and saying hello. He plays 1 verse of one of his songs and then goes into a conversation with the audience about his life telling us about the music that inspired him.  He begins with the 60s and works his way up to the 1990s.  While he tells you about the music of the decades (which we already know) he plays 1 or 2 verses from a few of the songs.  We counted a total of only 5 actual Garth songs that were played; one of them was only played after an audience member requested it at the end of the show.  \n\nWe kept thinking that at any moment the lights would go out, fireworks would fire and then a decked out Garth ready to entertain would come out and blow our minds.  Well it didn't happen.  Instead we got a not even close to a surprise appearance by....wait for it....wait for it....his wife!!!! WOW did you all see that coming?  What effort did that take to book that guest?  \n\nThe good part of the show was the up close and personal vibe that Garth was going for.  He was charming and entertaining with his stories about his dad and growing up.  \n\nIf Garth is reading this, maybe you need to get back in touch with us in low places and respect the fact that you do have a job.  You have the job of entertaining and shame on you for not respecting us.  Shame on you.  \n\nSave your money!!!  If you're going to Vegas go see Cher, the same price for a really amazing show (even if it's not country music).  Or go to Toby Keith's bar and rock out to all your favorite artists for free (plus cost of drinks of course) and party your booty off.  That's what we did and to be honest, it was at Toby's bar that we actually heard Garth's music!  Shame on you Garth!!! \n\nPS: Having to bring IDs for everyone in your group.....time waster and pointless."
0,"When this store was Marshall Field's, I was a regular shopper.  It was always clean and neat with friendly associates who were willing to go the extra mile to make you happy.  Fast forward to 2014 and Macy's.  This store is in constant disarray.  It amazes me how crammed the racks are.  It makes it difficult to walk in departments without getting hit in the arms or the back.  There selection of Men's big and tall is totally non existent.  Every department is either so jumbled with clothing that it is impossible to shop or their tables are just piled (not folded) with so much stuff that you just wanna pass it by.  Then there is the subject of their employees.  RUDE.  They could care less about how their department looks.  All they are concerned with is when is my shift over and when do I get paid.   There are many other choices that I have to shop at and I will always choose those over Macy's."
0,"I ordered their cafe latte, it was so plain and no coffee taste at all! Wouldn't visit their store a second time"
0,Worst printing service I ever had. The employee raped my friend's bank accounts by misquoting them and giving them zero options. We are design students at asu and were very dissatisfied with the overall experience that was offered. I will never bring my business to this location or any other fedex office or junkie locations again.
0,"Hertz here is awful, worst I've ever seen.  50 people in line, four behind the counter.  Don't\nSeem to care...line is longer than my flight!!  Buses keep delivering people.  Could it be that it's a surprise that a lot of people show up at 2:00, wanting to pick up cars they paid for.  Cost is not worth this aggravation, I beg you to go somewhere else ....again, worst I have ever seen."
1,The coffee was hot and it was right around the corner from the condo. Grande bold every morning and didn't have to wait.
0,"This review is long overdue.\n\nIt was our first night in town and the worst dinner ever. Way over priced! Their \""New York\"" steak was a sirloin. Went to the Triple George the next night and got a better meal for $40 less with drinks and dessert. \n\nOh, and the waiter was two feet from my chair for the whole meal. You might think this would be a good thing but it was kind of creepy."
0,"We went for sunday brunch , i like the fact they open at 7am, i figure everyone still sleeping nursing late night hangovers. I was right at 7 am only a handful of us old folks in line. . The buffet was very limited and not many items. For about 25 bucks a head you should get more. The hot foods were mostly breakfast items what happend to the lunch part of brunch. Very sad. Everthing was fresh as it should be since we were their early. Still can't believe a beautiful casino , ' upscale\"" would have a brunch that was so simple. Spend a few more bucks and go to wynn, or bellagio.  Service was fine."
1,"This bar is now one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. 2 shots & a beer for $9?? Yes please! The crowd was so diverse and the karaoke was fabulous! We went there on a Saturday night and it was crowded, smokey and fun. If you can't handle smoke, then this is not the place for you! The bartenders have a stiff pour and the rest of the staff is very friendly. Please be advised that true to Dive Bar standards, there is only one toilet in the bathroom, so you WILL be waiting to take a pee, so don't break the seal ladies!"
0,"This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have \""the biggest and best sandwiches\"", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place."
1,"Found a new gem in the Southwest part of Vegas. It's a breakfast/brunch/lunch spot that happened to be on my way home from the gym. I'm glad boyfriend and I decided to stop in and give it a try. When we went, it was closer to closing and there were not many people in there. The food arrived very quickly after we ordered and the staff was very attentive. \n\nHere's what we tried: \n\nGoblet skillet - Turkey Sausage, Spinach, Roasted Red Pepper over Home Fries with Cheese. Not the deep fried kind, but the delicious kind fried atop a commercial flat-top stove. The skillet came with a side of your choice of 1 biscuit and gravy or toast. Of course, I went with the biscuit and gravy. The skillet came in a hearty portion that I was unable to finish. \n\nGriddle platter - Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread. This was also a scrumptious meal served in a large portion. Just the right amount of feta cheese rounded out the flavors. I liked the goblet skillet way better. \n\nNow, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted because everything on the menu looked so good. Next time, I'm going to try the marinated steak tips because, as the menu says, it is \""marinated 18 hrs in Unicorn tears, served with 3 Eggs, Home Fries, Biscuit & Gravy.\"" UNICORN TEARS. \n\nSold."
1,"Can't say enough great things about this place.  The ambiance, the service, the food.  All GREAT.  Definitely deserves 5 stars."
1,"Never in my life have I written any sort of review for anything, whether good or bad.\n\nHowever, this place was the BEST sushi I've ever had for the CHEAPEST price I've ever seen Sushi cost. Came here because it was Good Friday, and I DEFINITELY recommend this to any sushi lover. The customer service was amazing, the food was amazing, the food came out VERY quickly, and I will DEFINITELY be coming back here.\n\nI just felt like I had to tell someone about how great this place was."
1,"I had to get the carpets cleaned in the house I was moving out of and my neighbor referred me to these guys. All I can say is if you want to deal with true professionals, not the typical Las Vegas service company, call Noble. \nThey were on time, polite, professional and most importantly did a great job. \nWhen its time to get the carpets cleaned at my new place, I know exactly who I will be calling!"
0,"Worst customer service, the guy really asked me for my receipt to check my bag because he assumed I was stealing and he felt like an idiot when he didn't find anything"
1,I'm a fan of the glaze!
1,"Typical local bar, but I'd say it's nicer than most. The drinks are cold and food is descent. The pizzas are pretty good, and even better during happy hour. The wings are good as well. Nice spot to hangout after work."
1,"If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee."
0,"A bit overpriced for a morning egg scramble, but I guess that's to be expected in an airport. The scramble itself was overly greasy considering what I ordered didn't contain any meat in it. Two major issues that arise are that for one the service was extremely slow, a turn around of 45 minutes from Hello to Goodbye, something they need to address since their customer base have flights to catch. The other issue is that my waitress Kristen was completely vacant and unfriendly which culminated into placing BDBB's into my no fly zone."
0,If I could give Mark Taylor no stars I would. All of their leasing clowns get $11.25 hour.\nGreat pay for what they do! I guess they are told to not let U.S. VETS be approved. My credit score was .3 below acceptable for their $99 security deposit. They wanted a $100 more plus rent would go up $40 per month. The 2 things on the credit report were even listed as identity theft. They didn't care. A women named Amanda said tough no refund for the apartment. Mark Taylor is a true SCUMBAG!
1,"Went here yesterday with a couple friends and to be honest, I was quite impressed. \nThe staff wasn't too in your face and their burgers were phenomenal. \n\nWe started with some chicken wings that were scrumptious to say the least and didn't last long between the 3 of us. \n\nA friend and I shared the \""Rehab\"" size of the Chili Burger and it was delish. With the Pretzel bun and sweet potato tater tots, I was in love! Although her and I both agreed \"" WE WANT MORE CHILI!\"" on the burger next time. \n\nI am now addicted  and the only treatment is more Rehab."
0,"Went there today for lunch with a group of 7.  Not one person had anything good to say about their food.  Even the BOGO pasta person was dissatisfied.  The restaurant was practically empty and the service was extremely slow.  I had their chopped salad to start which was described as having tomatoes, bleu cheese, and prosciutto among the ingredients.  They were so sparse and tiny that it practically took a magnifying glass to see them amongst all the lousy iceberg.  A definite ripoff and disappointment.  My entree wasn't terrible--ordered off the light menu.  \n\nEven though we specified when we ordered how we wanted the checks split; at the close of the meal, we were told by our server that their system wouldn't do that and that we should pass around the master bill and figure it out for ourselves.  After getting a manager involved and quite a lengthly wait, we finally got our totals and were out of there.  This lunch experience in a nearly empty restaurant took almost 2 hrs.  All around a huge disappointment.  I definitely won't be going back!"
0,"Horrid! Got a Cheese Burger, cheese curds & a side of fries. Almost $12.00. You can get a small steak at Fridays for that price. \n\nThe burger patty was so thin that the lettuce overpowered the beef. You couldn't even taste the beef. At all.  \n\nI counted 14 marble sized cheese curds in my basket. Half of which had all the cheese cooked out.  \n\nI called and spoke with the manager after my visit & she seemed very used to the complaints & did not seem to care. \n\nI will NEVER return. You would be wise to avoid it. CULVER'S ALL THE WAY!"
1,"This review is way over due. This place is only opened for lunch. Since I don't work in the area, lunch is tough to do. But one Saturday afternoon the stars aligned and my wife and I found ourselves in the area and decided to check it out.\n\nI had the Vermonter, which is turkey, ham, cranberry mayo, cheddar cheese, romaine lettuce, red onion and a slice of apple. I thought the sandwich tasted great. My wife had some soup and a sandwich and she loved it.\n\nBut what is really telling, is that Dave the Owner slipped an extra spoon for the soup on to my wife's basket. Probably knowing that I probably would want a taste as well. He knew before I knew. That's a great touch Dave! It shows that you are always taking that extra step in pleasing your customers."
1,"Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.\n\nI really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.\n\nHOWEVER.....\n\nEVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.  Anyway, everything is top notch."
0,"Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.\n\nRewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach pur\u00e9e. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it. \n\nNow fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf \""do you want another beer?\"" Then he answered \""sure I'll take another one.\"" Then she replies with \""what is it?\"" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after. \n\nLooks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way."
1,"We were a little concerned when we saw the reviews but we had a great experience!! It was a wonderful evening on the lake, food was excellent, and service was good! They do cater to their members but if your not a member someone will come pick you up in a golf cart at the parking area and drop you at the front door. My husband had the special that night which was a pastrami hot sandwich. It was amazing!!! Fried fish was good too. Beautiful sunset on the lake and cold beer. We will be back!"
0,"When my fiance dropped off ten items to be cleaned at the Gilbert location on Val Vista, he was quoted $4.25 per item. At pick up, the price had increased 20%. Not only that, a $300.00 shirt was spotted with grease. We will not be using this location again."
0,"Super rude & nasty workers. Went there to return something/exchange. The 1st lady was by the register writing something. She just said wait. While she was writing not even saying please or greeting me etc. 2nd lady came to the 1st lady and said how that item is so old they don't carry it anymore. ?? Like what the hell is going on here I'm right in front of you and I can hear your stupid ass. After a few mins 1st lady was like what is this. I want to return or get a store credit because I'm not happy with this purchase. She's like we don't carry this item no more in the store. The hell you don't it's right there in the window display area in purple. She's like oh no it's different color and model. Well I want exchange it. She's like it pass 90 days you can't read the receipt. I jump back and was like WHAT.. It clearly says 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed don't u know how to read. I'm a paying customer how the hell your going to be so rude and trying to belittle your customer. She didn't want to help me at all. So I didn't get to exchange my item that I purchased in this store.\n\nI will never be purchasing from Kipling again. I have been buying Kipling items for many years. I'll be taking my money and business else where, where they respect their customers and value them."
0,"We planned our trip late and El Monte Las Vegas was the only company with available RVs. In retrospect, a bad sign.  \n- Customer service: We waited 4 hours before anyone would acknowledge us about the RV we reserved. Others renters had been there more than 5 hours waiting to check out. While some of their team members are well intentioned, others sit around unwilling to talk to you unless your name is next on the list. Similarly, returning the RV took 1.5 hours. Add travel time to their location and El Monte ate an entire day of my vacation! \n- Hidden Charges: The RV pricing looks good on the web, but then EL Monte adds on numerous charges and set up fees. Worst of all: Their RVs don't come with bedding or kitchen supplies, but they'll rent these to you at exorbitant rates. For example, a set of pots and dishes that could be purchased for $40 at Walmart cost $125 a week to rent. A set of blankets and sheets for one person rents for $50!\n- Equipment: before we drove off the lot both the toilet and the cap to the fresh water tank needed to be fixed. In the case of the latter, a locking cap was replaced with a cap with no lock,  so potentially someone could access and pour anything into our freshwater tank.  Pretty unsafe. \nOn the road, the whole rig rattled and the engine whined up any incline. My kids named it \""the hunk of junk.\"" These RVs have been ridden hard.\n- My advice: book ahead somewhere (anywhere) other than El Monte, even if it's more expensive. In the end, you'll save money and your precious hours of vacation."
1,"Un bar vraiment nice comme je les aime ! \n\nSur la rue tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e de Saint-Denis, pas si loin que la station Berri-UQAM, l'Am\u00e8re \u00e0 Boire est un bar/brasserie qui vous propose des bi\u00e8res vraiment pas ch\u00e8res et des plats comme des burgers, tapas ou encore fish & chips.\n\nAvec les coll\u00e8gues, j'avais test\u00e9 les gyozas frits au lapin en guise de tapas. C'\u00e9tait super bon et bien croustillant, mais \u00e0 vrai dire j'avais encore faim ^^. Les autres avaient opt\u00e9 pour des hamburgers : tr\u00e8s bon aussi selon eux !\n\nPour les bi\u00e8res, je vous conseille tout simplement la rousse \""l'Am\u00e8re \u00e0 Boire\"", qui a une certaine touche faisant toute la diff\u00e9rence. \n\nSur deux \u00e9tages (rez-de-chauss\u00e9e + un \u00e9tage au dessus), il y a aussi une terrasse accessible depuis l'int\u00e9rieur, mais en temps d'hiver, elle \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9e ! \nDe plus, un service agr\u00e9able et disponible si besoin. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela une ambiance bon enfant et fun (malgr\u00e9 que cela soit assez bruyant) !\n\n\u00c0 coup s\u00fbr, j'y reviendrai pour go\u00fbter d'autres vari\u00e9t\u00e9s de bi\u00e8res !"
1,Very consistent.  This location always does well with Service.
1,"Ok, let's get this straight right off the bat.  I don't think Starbucks makes the best coffee around, but it's consistant and I really like that.  That was especially important when I used to travel constantly for work.  I knew what I liked and it would be the same no matter where I went.  Anyway, I drove through this Starbucks yesterday morning after dropping my sweet pea at akido because I had been up since 4:00 am and needed a little caffeine and sugar.  I ordered a iced soy mocha, a big treat for me because I'm trying to stay away from refined sugar and animal proteins, and waited my turn to make it around to the little window.  All in all I'd say I was inline for about five minutes.  Nothing unheard of for a Saturday morning.  When I got to the window the girl handed me my drink and said it was on them for the long wait!  That just made my day!  How considerate of them.  The mocha hit the spot and gave me enough energy to run the rest of my errands.  I'll be back for more."
1,My wife and I came here a few weeks back when it was 110 degrees plus. But this was a neat find. They have all sorts of cool displays about the natural history of the area. I thoroughly enjoyed the geology and anthropology aspects of this place. They had lots of neat displays and interactive games for the younger folks (and those young at heart folks). There was a really neat flash flood simulation. I'd recommend this. \n\nOverall this was a great place to visit and I look forward to going back this winter when it's cooler. I would have given the place 5 stars but I have to deduct one star for the children's environment confessional. Seems too much like brain washing instead of education.
1,"Being a huge Benihana fan, I had to try Hiyashi Japanese Steakhouse while visiting Goodyear.\nI must say, the greeting and welcoming as we walked in had to be one of the best I have ever experienced. I felt like they knew me here.\nAfter the excellent entrance, we were seated by the Hibachi grill. There we sat for about 15 minutes before the talented chef walked in.\nAfter a fun and exciting show. I had to check if I still had eyebrows. The guy sure  loved playing with fire.\nThe food was excellent. I had the steak and scallop diner with the fried rice. The service was on point and the drinks constantly flowing. The experience is worth the visit.\nI am a fan and will return whenever I'm in town again.\n\nUpdate 2: 8/6/2014\n\nI said I would be back and I did. As far as the experience goes, nothing much has changed. The service is still friendly and attentive. The food is still up to standards as well as the hibachi experience. \nOne thing that I won't lose sleep over but did catch my attention was the booth benches. A few had tears and looked used and abused. I think it is time to update the furniture folks. Besides that, I highly recommend."
0,"I kept paying for monthly service and I don't know why.  The house was never really clean - just wiped down. \n\nThey rushed through the job wiping surfaces and pushing dirt around. \n\nI sent pictures of how dirty our tile floors were AFTER they cleaned and talked to them about the floors on several occasions. \n\nIt's too bad, but the attention to detail and a little TLC are completely lacking with this company."
0,"Went for lunch, had 2 starters, a main and side between 2 of us as well as a couple of drinks. Initial service (from the owner, we think) was good and friendly but once the boss left the waitress just faced the wall the whole time and was difficult to communicate with...\n\nThe food sounded great on paper and ened up tasting very Brakes Bros. The stroganoff was not a stroganoff, bread slightly stale with soup, garlic mayo def from a tub, fries ok but not too hot, salsa like a tinned tomato with some green herb added - like crunchy water, very odd!!! \n\nWe had to move since promised free wifi was not available at our table. That was when we noticed how poorly maintained things were - walls with peeling paint, terribly old fashioned and damaged chairs, chips in the walls, old-fashioned decor peeling off... \n\nIt was dark and nearly dingy and the service remained lacking pizazz with atmosphere suffering. We won't rush back unfortunately."
1,Had an amazing trip with these guys.  Total pro's who love what they do and it shows.  Highly recommend.
0,"I called ahead and made a 3:30 appointment for a haircut so I wouldn't have to wait. I arrived on time and told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Kelli. Rather than tell Kelli I was there waiting, this arrogant woman ignored me and continued to talk on the phone for maybe 10 minutes before I got angry and left. No way would I go back to this business. They are obviously unable to hire front-desk employees with a minimum level of competence."
1,"Great neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Happy hour is super cheap.  Buy a beer and get a 50cent app?  Sign me up!  My friend and I ordered around 10 rolls and orders of sushi plus a couple beers and our bill was only $50.  Sushi was fresh and good quality.  All the rolls we ordered were delicious.  4 stars only because the service was a little slow, but they only had 2 guys rolling sushi for the entire restaurant."
0,"If Toby Keith really loves this place, he would fire the current chefs and hire new ones.  \n\nThe service was very nice but the food............bleh!  One of the worst BBQ Baby Back Ribs I've had.  It was dry and not much taste.  The Jumbo Fried Shrimps were so heavily battered, it tasted more like donut shrimps.  \n\nI've come to the conclusion that Harrah's gives away food vouchers because no one would actually come here to eat if they had to pay for it!  Well, certainly not me."
0,"I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is."
1,Best BBQ in charlotte the place looks great. Service is always great I love that a lot of the waitress's are covered in tattoos. The BBQ is a great mix of all styles. My favorite is the ribs. They have a very respectful beer selection as well.I would give it five stars but the tables are cramped and I always get bumped. But it's worth it so we come here often.
0,"I too purchased a groupon for this place and ate there last night. Here's what to expect: an empty place for the most part, pizza that does not compare to a frozen Tombstone you can purchase at a dollar store for a buck, dim-witted waitresses who, if bodies were brains, would be considered for Mensa, but that's not all. When we ordered my partner asked for a Sprite, since nowhere on the menu are listings for soft drinks. MORE THAN THAT, THERE ARE NO PRICES LISTED!!! So when the bill came and saw a charge of 5.99 for the Sprite, I asked to speak to a manager. The poor cook came back after apparently speaking with him/her, said there was nothing he/she was going to do about it, and handed my partner a garish Tshirt as some sort of compensation I suppose. Well that's not good enough. I will write to Groupon and ask for a refund, will never ever patronize this place, and will spread the word to those in my social networks to do the same thing. I don't mind paying for something once I know the price. But we're talking about soda here, fizzy water, and to charge 5.99 for it is simply stupid. And now this review is what they get for their trouble! This place won't last 6 months, if that. And then they will wonder how and why they failed. They can read this post to figure out perhaps that you don't get repeat customers or new new customers by being slick with your prices, hoping that no one will notice. Well I noticed. And as far as the Tshirt, we gave it to a bum on the bridge as we walked back to the Cosmo."
0,"2.5...same as Carnival in Rio:\n\nHuge selections, our server was such a lovely lady and bottomless mimosa for $27...can't beat that. Plus, we came when there was NO line on a Saturday noon. Wow!\n\nSadly...the crab legs are super duper skinny and the baby shrimp (well)...\n\nWon't be going out of the strip for this again..."
0,"Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \n\nTo put it simply, this place has:\nA decent happy hour\nOkay service\nMediocre sushi\n\nJust go somewhere else."
0,"I have only been once, this past Sunday, but left after nearly three hours. It was as if Sanford & Son had taken over an auction house. I kept waiting for TLC to show up with a camera crew; it was such utter chaos.\n\nThere must have been 600 lots up for auction, ranging from nice Victorian-era furniture to very cheap trinkets you might encounter at Goodwill. Auction lots were hand labeled/numbered with tape, but this soon seemed meaningless as there was no rhyme, reason or order to what lot was auctioned next. Mr. Brunk, the owner, would wander the room picking up pots and pans for the next item, or another painting, while the previous item was being auctioned. And there was no printout or listing. If you came for one specific item, or items, listed on their website, you were liable to be stuck there the entire day waiting, hopeful, that luck would be on your side and your item would be randomly picked next from the dusty hoard.\n\nMind you, just because your item(s) were listed on the website for that day doesn't seem to mean they were going to be actually auctioned off that day. We drove 42 miles from Chandler across the valley to Sun City for this \""auction\"" only to be informed in Mr. Brunk's opening monologue (he should do standup) that they hadn't bothered to unpack or sort all the boxes this week. In short, for us, the items we had planned to bid on but couldn't find on the floor, were apparently still in boxes and would likely (no guarantee) be up for bid next Sunday.\n\nSpeaking of standing, we arrived to find a large building with easily 100+ seats inside, but most, if not all, were marked with tape, reserving them for \""regulars\"" of the auction. We could understand this practice if, indeed, the regulars would bid on things, but from what we could tell, many of the regulars came for the bar-b-que sandwiches (pretty good), the cameraderie (fine, whatever), and the fun of a day out of the house in dusty, windswept Sun City, AZ. Within minutes of the auction starting, we counted at least six \""regulars\"" already fast asleep in chairs that might have gone to actual bidders who were left standing around the room's edges.\n\nAfter nearly three hours, we'd had enough. Mind you, these folks were pro's at getting people to pay $50 for chipped glass boxes you can get for $5 at the swap meet, which is probably where they found them.\n\nIf you're looking for \""Honey Boo Boo & Family Go to the Auction\"", you'll find no better place... and the BBQ was decent."
1,The food was so delicious! We ordered 5 pasta dishes and I large pizza! The service was even better! We all left full and happy and don't leave without trying the gelato.
0,"Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place"
0,Absolute worst service ever. We were completely lied to several times by the company. We paid money for nothing to be done. They stated they would come back out twice and never did. Avoid this company at all costs! Should definitely not be called Speedy Air. The one time they did show up they were 2 hours past the allotted time given.
0,"I arrived with high hopes. A few of us had just finished the Phoenix 10K and were excited for a the glutinous reward of a hearty breakfast. Having eaten at Two Hippies burgers and having seen the huge line at their Taco Shop, I wasn't expecting haute cuisine, but surely a tasty breakfast at a good price. \n\nThings started out well, but went downhill fast. The main item on their menu is a breakfast bowl, and the list of additions you can add is immense. The person taking our order immediately won me over by telling me we could order this as a breakfast burrito. I piled on the toppings and, still lightheaded with anticipation of our feast, threw in a side order of biscuits and gravy for good measure. \n\nWhen the food was ready, it was packaged \""to go\"", which is how they serve all dishes at the restaurant. So, you're not exactly saving the world when you eat here, but that's another matter altogether. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy was possibly the WORST interpretation of this dish I had ever seen. I can't stress this enough. The driest biscuit I had ever tried to drive a fork into, covered in what can only be called a sausage puree soup. Horrible. If that had been my entire meal, I would be giving this one star. I hate to labor the point, but someone at the establishment either needs to rethink this dish or just take it off the menu. \n\nThe burrito was just OK. It was filled with all of the ingredients I had asked for. It was hot. But, it really lacked any flavor and the salsa provided was watery and bland. I ended up putting chili sauce on each bite to give it some flavor. \n\nLong story short, I was very disappointed. I walked in with expectations of at least a decent breakfast, but Two Hippies totally missed for me. I can't imagine I'll be back."
1,"I have to admit I was a little nervous about staying at the Luxor. It looked nice online and had a very reasonable price, but I had heard bad reviews from friends who have stayed there. The one bit of advice I was given was to make sure our room was in the tower versus the pyramid. \n\nThe day before we arrived I called to make sure we were booked to stay in the tower. We were not, but the lady said it was only $20 per night to upgrade. That seemed reasonable to me so I went ahead and paid the upgrade fee.\n\nOverall our stay at the Luxor was very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. Our room was very nice and CLEAN!! Clean is the biggest issue for me so I was very happy. With our room we got two free drinks, special deals for Luxor shows, and free wired Internet access. The only downside was that the Luxor is not in the center of the strip. We didn't mind though. We liked the exercise of walking down the strip everyday. \n\nWe stayed the last night of our vacation over at the Paris Hotel, but I wasn't impressed. I wish we would've just stayed the whole trip at the Luxor. The Luxor is good in my book....."
1,"I knew that the next time I came to Montreal I was going to pop my Garde Manger cherry.\n\nMy first time was everything I had hoped for, and more!\n\nWe made a reservation (smart idea), and were seated right away at the bar. Perfect place to sit for a small group of 2 or 3! \n\nMust have - Lobster Poutine. One might think this is probably Chuck Hughes' most overrated dish...but trust me, it was well due the accolades! Absolutely delicious. Poutine with just the right amount of \""fishiness\"" added to the gravy, curds, and frites. We also had the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork (equally amazing) and the Pierogies & Pork Belly (yum). \n\nService was great. Ambience was perfect. \n\nIt's a great feeling when a restaurant can live up to high expectations! I can't wait to come back again and try other items!\n\nC'est tres tres bonne!!!!!"
1,"Two words- cheap, good. Lunch specials are very affordable and the portions aren't too bad. So many noodle, rice and a la carte dishes to choose from. To be honest the quality is better than Sam Woo's. Come here for lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"I think Marnie has a great concept for some amazing health benefits and increasing strength and balance of the body. What attracted me to come to the Tough lotus studio was my desire to do supported inversions to relieve back pain. I have been to about 4 classes now and am really starting to \""get it\"". I am on a 5 class pass from groupon and am considering buying her 10 class package next. \nI think the value of her ariel fitness comes once you attend several classes regularly over a period of at least two weeks. That increases your likeliness to get the most benefits from the experience. I have done ariel yoga in the past but this is a bit different. I like the tough lotus class for the challenge but then I like the balanced yoga for the longer stretching. I thought i was in good shape until Marnie asked us to do \""handstand pushups\"".\nMy back always feels 10x better after i leave. However, my biggest hope is to gain increased neuromuscular activity for my little tiny stabilizer muscles. It feels great to finally work that small stuff you rarely do in the gym with free weights. The tension relief from decompression of the spine is the icing on the cake for me! It might look like \""yoga\"" but if you do it often enough you'll discover the difference. \nI commend Marnie for teaching so many classes a day. Props to doing it on your own girl :)"
0,"Food was perfect. i got the galbi burger with house kim chi on the side. why the bad review? we came in with a group of 12+ we called in they accommodated us and had a warm welcome. So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.\n\nwhen coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience."
0,"The work they do is great, their prices are affordable. But this place is never open when they say they are."
1,"Great place, loved my pizza and wine the owner went out of his way to be sure we were having a good time. Happy hour prices helped too.. Walked out with a (pizza enough for 2) and a glass of wine for $14 total. Will return"
1,What a great place eat!! Plenty to choose from and there are always leftovers. The biscuits are brought out with butter and only. Still warm and ooohhh so good. After changing my mind too many times to count I went with the meatloaf sandwich. What a great choice. Meatloaf was tasty and had sauce and mozzarella. The horseradish mashed were a great side to this dish. I had a bite of my wife's burger that had mashed potatoes between two buns and that was different for sure but still good. So much food so do not be scared by the prices.
0,Sunday morning isn't a great day for new employees but I'm chill - first nobody made my coolata while my food got cold :/ 2nd when I finally got it - it was melted even though I had just gotten it\nby the time I came home my sammy was all mushy instead of nice & crisp\nThrew it in the broiler for 2 minutes & it completely burnt up :(\nBut why should I have to come home & cook after spending $ on food?!\nPlus the everything bagel I ordered for the other sammy wasn't everything - plain Jane something  I NEVER would've ordered \nDon't let me spend $30 on shit I don't want!\nShame on you dunkin donuts!\nGoing back to Pink Box!
1,Oh god. Yes.\n\nThe Pho Tai here is pho king incredible.\n\nBest in the pho king Valley.
0,"The location and atmosphere are tops, service is fine, food is forgettable.  I can say this because I ate there about a month ago, and now that I'm getting around to doing the review I can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing from someone who can recite an excellent meal course by course for years afterwards.  we did started with quesadia, and the four os us all got different dishes, all of which I tasted and not of which were either outstanding or offensive.  The red wine selection is heavy on the highly fruity/jammy styles.\n\nThe location next to the light rail on Central, and with the big outdoor patio can make a trip to Maizie's worthwhile if you are looking for a place sit, talk and nosh, if nosh isn't your key focus.  My husband and and I went with some relatives we hadn't seen in ages, and it was a great place to sit and catch up for a few hours.  And despite the crowd's that evening the server was gracious about not hurrying us out of there."
1,"The service for July 4 was amazing, but ask for Irene if you want the best advice on when to go, where to go, when and how to make your reservations, etc.,etc. 107 is the absolute best place to see ALL the fireworks across ALL of Las Vegas!  However, we'd specifically come to see the Stratosphere fireworks and our waitress couldn't tell us on what side of the floor to sit, wish we'd found Irene in time. Of course we we were opposite of where we wanted to be."
0,"Yuck. This was the worst pho I have ever had. Bad broth, ugly meat, wilted veggies. Service was awful. The dude up front was coughing violently, and blowing his nose. Go to Khai Hoan. I feel sick right now and may have food poisoning-\n\n-Update\nI definitely got food poisoning from Pho All Seasons-"
0,"I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the \""other\"" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better."
0,WTH! Low quality photographers who do not care if the background is set proper or not. They also lied. I wanted a full body pic in two different attires but took in just one of them and said he took in both the attires. The photographer also did not know how to take a full body pic. He took a pic which looks like he captured it from the sky rather than from the ground. Very disappointed.
1,"Sushi is first rate, the fish is so fresh! Loved the albacore,  tried beef toungue, DELICIOUS! Must come back and try the hot dishes.... Hard to find real Japanese food, so glad we found this!"
0,"Eh...it was fine.\n\nWe were hanging out watching the band outside the Downtown Grand and watched 395898 people get pizza here. I knew I remembered the name from Yelp and that it had pretty good reviews, so we decided to get a slice before heading up to our room.\n\nWe stood in the Take Out line, 3 people in front of us and it took a really, really long time. However, the guy inside was seriously hustling, so it wasn't a lazy thing, more a ton of people eating inside thing. I really wanted a basic slice of cheese, but they were out so I went with pepperoni.\n\nLike I said above, eh..I thought it was a little too greasy, and nothing to write home about. I ate about a quarter and called it good. I think I would have liked the cheese better, but it's hard to say. Would I eat it again? Maybe, if it was late and there wasn't really anything else open. It was cheap, $3.75, so it had that going for it. \n\nI will say they had other, more interesting pizzas like a California and purple potato, so maybe those would have been better choices, but I think that maybe this place just isn't my cup of tea. I would say it is probably worth checking out and forming your own opinion though because between the 4-5 star reviews and how busy it was, a lot of people would disagree with my opinion on the place."
0,Super expensive. Half this stuff you can get online for 3/4 cheaper. The people who work here are also pretty rude and almost none of them are knowledgeable about their products. It's like they get their stock from adamandeve.com and then hike up the price 60%.
1,"We used to go to this location a lot when it was Sushi on Summerlin.  They have new owners and have remodeled, and the whole vibe is pretty cool.  The main sushi chef is pretty awesome.  I should know his name by now, but he's a younger guy with a pony tail and he's excellent. \n\nWe've been there a few times and now when we arrive, he already makes our favorites and we're served immediately.  \n\n$5 all-you-can-drink draft Sapporo?!?  All day any day?!?   \n\nI started coming here because the rude owner at Naka Sushi was so insulting, and I'm so glad I did.  Good food.  Good service.  Make sure you try the Sasa Roll.  And if you like spicy tuna...their extra spicy mix is the BOMB!!  They use tons of masago (Japanese caviar).\n\nIf you're craving AYCE sushi in the NW...I highly recommend Sasa over Naka."
0,"Would give \""0\"" stars if possible, as after 2 hours waiting, my bird never was seen for his wellness visit and nail trim. Had an 11:00 am appt, and being new to town got a little lost thru airport connector, but courteously called at 11:05 to say I has .7 miles away. I was put on hold and then told I would need to reschedule, as they were backed up already and me being late would make it worse (??). I let her know I had driven from Summerlin and had the bird with me and really inconvenient and was already almost there. Arrived to 2 people in the waiting room, the one lady ahead of me had waited 2 hours herself and had a sick bird. I arrived at 11:10, no one at reception and waited 20 min for someone to inquire if they could help and then acted confused as to what my visit was for, ie why did my bird need to be seen? (Don't you have it listed in the schedule as we discussed at length when inset the appt) Sat there for 90 minutes with no check in by the staff whatsoever -they were more concerned with who didn't have a car to go get lunch at jack in the box. At 12:50 pm, once I was sure previous patients were gone I asked about timing of being seen. She really couldn't say as \""an emergency just called in\"" and they'd have to see them when they arrived. Sat there 10 more minutes hoping to be seen before emergency arrived and nothing. Emergency patient arrived and I left. Not so much as an \""I'm sorry for the delays\"" or a follow up phone call to find out where we went or if they could reschedule. Flamingo Clinic obviously doesn't have enough vets on staff to manage the customer flow, as I have had my bird 6 years and vets in Phoenix and Boston and never been made to wait more than 10-15 minutes. My time is just as valuable as theirs, but they don't seem to get that concept, nor care to have my bird as a regular patient. No worries as have already found several other options who were more than happy to take us in, with much nicer, cleaner facilities. Flamingo Clinic was a very unsettling experience -Rude, non-client centric business-not sure how you stay in business."
1,"Do you prefer a mile high pastrami on rye? If so, then run, don't walk to this Chompies. On the edge of the ASU campus, it's  within a fifteen minute drive from my condo. It's best to go during \""off hours\"", unless you don't mind waiting. Try the Matza Ball soup, it's loaded with veggies, plus a hearty broth. A breakfast special for under $5 is available everyday. The servers are friendly, cute & efficient. What else does a person want in a restaurant?"
1,I love Paradise Bakery.. I operate a small graphic design business and enjoy getting out of the office to work. Paradise Bakery is very accommodating.. they don't seem to mind when I spend a few hours there.. The staff has been awesome and the food is always excellent.
0,"This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period, however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get to\n\nOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here \n\nThat being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful, with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot, and you will have a stand out dish\n\nIn general their soups are solid, but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soup\n\nGo for the Tom Yum, get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles"
1,worthy !!
1,"I stumbled on this place a few months ago when I wanted to treat myself. LOVE IT. I get a mani/pedi for $30! Pedicure includes hot stone massage, warm lotion and a great leg massage. I've gone here a few times, never with an appointment and they always take me and get me to a massage chair to start my pedicure. \n\nThe only thing that surprised me was when my boyfriend asked for the paraffin on his hands, the girl brought out 2 plastic bags with warm wax in them and told him to slip his hands in while she tied them around his wrists. Seemed a little tacky but the result was smoother skin. \n\nI'm going back there this Friday again to prepare for sandal season."
1,"I always enjoy Eleven for dinner, great drinks, meals and service. Never disappoints but some may find it pricey to enjoy on a regular basis. \nA great value is Eleven's Sunday brunch! For $29 you get a choice of cocktail or juice. The Cucumber Moscow Mule was so fresh and yummy! Choice of appetizer...from six fresh oysters to beignets something tasty for everyone and then an entree ranging from waffles, burgers, omelettes with bacon and so much more. All served with quality sides and attentive service. (Peet's coffee is so tasty too!) What a value! A great place to take visitors or just yourself. I have gone several times and like to keep Eleven's brunch in heavy rotation"
0,"I think I must have been there the same day as Ron H!!  As Ron mentioned, this is Spring Training time in Scottsdale.  There actually aren't that many breakfast places around in Old Town, and David's should be taking full advantage, but we won't be back next year... sorry David. \n\nI'm just going to list the problems we encountered:\n1. Seated and ignored.\n2. A table of four came in after us, and they were eating within minutes of our order finally being taken.  They were seated right next to us, so it wasn't as if we couldn't be seen!  The young lady who finally took our order must have been on her first day, but seriously... hello, anybody in there?\n3.  The OJ is fresh squeezed and very tasty, but they can only make one glass at a time.  It is not chilled.  The OJ was gone by the time breakfast arrived.\n4.  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich.  I am not a traditional breakfast person, so I ordered a turkey sandwich.\n5.  We sat there and sat there and sat there.  The narrator's voice of Hells Kitchen was playing in my head, \""and the guests were getting impatient.\""\n6.  Finally, a waitress (not ours), inquired if we had been served yet (since the previously mentioned table of four were leaving after consuming their meals).  She hustled  back to the kitchen and came out with our order, apologizing for the delay.  I figured it was our dingbat server's fault, and I did not hold it against the establishment as a whole, except for the fact no one was following said dingbat around to make sure she was doing her job.\n7.  Our food arrived.  My turkey sandwich was tasty, but I was noticing the \""3 slices of bacon\"" promoted on the menu were absent.  I thought about complaining, but then my husband, after taking his first bite of his breakfast sandwich, said \""taste this bacon, it is the saltiest bacon I have ever eaten.\""  OMG, what an understatement!  It tasted like they rolled the bacon in salt, fried it, and then rolled it in more salt and slapped it on an egg sandwich.\n8.  Hubby complained... I decided not to complain about my asbsent bacon.  They offered to make him another (he requested sausage instead) but the whole process took so long, my husband finally cancelled the order.  We were in there well over an hour by this time.\n9. The older guy (maybe this is David or the manager) was very apologetic, offered to take it off the bill and wrap up the new sandwich to go, but hubby decided he was probably better off not taking a chance."
0,"Went here looking for something to eat that was fast.  Turns out the only thing that was fast were my bowels after I ate here.  I got mild food poisoning along with a friend that ate here the same night.  \n\nNow if the food was really really good I could maybe maybe deal with it and take my chances but it was mediocore at BEST.  Nothing really tasty or unique about their pizza.  Also, the service was slow considering the amount of customers they had.  I'm done!"
1,"One of my buddies took me here one day.  I've driven past it a few times and thought the name didn't sound like Chinese Food.  So when he suggested it, I was a little skeptical.  Wow...was I wrong.  The food was fantastic!  The restaurant was very clean (cleaner than my kitchen), service was great.  Very much like Pei-Wei in that you seat yourselves and eat with silverware.  The \""don't judge a book by it's cover\"" adage seemed true here.  In this case, the name.  Tried the Orange Chicken, Chow Fun Bowl, Lettuce wraps.  All great."
0,"I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about."
0,Litteraly worst nail shop I've ever been too... The first girl put soo much acrylic all over my fingers that when I went to seperate the sides of my nail from my finger it ripped my skin off ... My nails have never stung more wile getting them done ... Than she put the wrong size nail on my middle finger ... Than in 5 days my brand new set a nail broke ....... So I felt like I had to go back so I could get matching polish .... A different lady put the wrong acrylic on my clear nails had to redo that and than questioned me y I wanted the nail polish the way I wanted it as if I wasn't a paying customer ... I will NEVER return here again !
1,Try the lunch bagels!  The Northern exposure and Tempe turkey are excellent.  The chicken salad is really good too.  They aren't real expensive and the service is pretty good.  They also have outdoor seating.  They are new and as far as I can tell not a chain.  I recommend you try them.  Oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 2pm.
0,"This is the first negative review I have ever posted. We purchased all our appliances for our first house, other homes since, vacation home, and provided many referrals to friends and family. Never again. I have experienced all the b.s customer service 101 push back answers others have too and had to call the store mgr multiple times over the last few months. \nWe selected a GE Profile fridge based on where the salesman told us the ice tray was located in the bottom - had him confirm with associates and data/mfg drawings he had. When it showed up not as we were told/sold, and we asked for an exchange we were told sure for a $600 \""restocking fee\"". \nWow, even when I was willing to spend potentially more to make my wife happy? The GE Profile dishwasher was incorrectly installed and has not yet been fixed. I went from a promotor to a negative nightmare for Spencers. A once great local company known for their customer service has lost their way. Getting a new customer is 10x as expensive as keeping an existing net promotor happy, too bad Spencers does not understand this simple equation and how simple it is to keep customers happy any more."
1,"I am writing a review of Mansions as a music venue.  This is a unique location to dine and listen to live music.  Because it's a small hotel, the staff is very attentive to the smallest needs and is very willing to help.  It's fun just to look around the place.  The acoustics are wonderful for live music, there's a lot of beautiful woodwork, and so the sound is live and warm.  I have eaten at the brunch and the food was wonderful, lots of choices from a buffet, and top quality and well prepared food.    Definitely worth visiting.  I will come back often."
0,The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!
0,Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!
1,"Go no farther than the Seabass!  Miso glazed to perfection!  We are so addicted to this dish we always order it, and let our 2nd dish be whatever...  Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail is one of the best rolls in town, often we come just for a quick nibble of that.  Be sure to make a reservation!"
1,The pot roast is amazing!  Service was amazing on such a busy Friday night.  One of the best places to eat or drink in the Lawrenceville area.
1,"Good boba shop located in the asian market in Chandler. They have a host of different boba flavors, with the option of having tapioca boba or jelly boba. They offer it as boba tea or the blended form kind of like an asian frappuccino. I'm a fan of the taro, its smooth, and its purple.\n\nThe food selection isn't bad either, I've only had the chicken potstickers and it was tasty.\n\nThe place is pretty small, most people go in and out for their boba fix."
0,"I hate writing a bad review, but in these times of financial struggle it makes a difference where you spend your money. It matters if you don't get what you paid for, and worse if you get treated badly while getting ripped off.  This is a bit of a long review - sorry - a few things happened that need explanation. \n\nBottom line for those in a hurry - don't go to this salon unless you want to be ripped off and treated like crap!  If you want more details, keep reading.\n\nSuch is the case for me with Honeycomb. I'd heard about the salon for years and as someone sensitive to hair chemical products, this place was about my last shot for what I hoped would be a good salon with good product.\n\nMy stylist was Sarah. The bio on the website made her seem like she'd be knowledgeable and customer service oriented. I mean she worked in New York and did celebrities hair (or so it says).\n\nMy only trip there was eventful. About an hour and 1/2 into my visit, a car literally drove into the building and crashed the business next door, about 5 feet from the front door of Honeycomb. This upset and distracted the 4 of us in the salon and took up a lot of time from my visit as Sarah spent a lot of time trying to deal with the people in the accident.\n\nMy consult with her was a bit lengthy. I have some history with my hair and health, and she had a lot of questions. At one point she made a snappy comment about needing to decide what we would do and get started. No problem - hey you are the one controlling the session as the stylist so take control if you have a problem. \n\nI agreed to do one of the treatments she suggested, to help the color take better, but at the wash bowl she made her own decision not to do it. When I asked about it, she wouldn't say why.  I was there for a partial and add'l color for gray. She would not do the color w/o me doing a 24 hr skin test due to my sensitivities. Ok, I understand that but I made it clear that I needed to get the gray covered. Maybe she should have suggested I come back when we could do it all - the right way.\n\nEnd result - I walked out with my hair looking EXACTLY the same as when I walked in (like sh*t), but my wallet was MUCH lighter. \n\n3 inches of demarcation showing and all, couldn't tell I had anything done to my hair.  I got a snarky comment at the end about her being 15 min late for her next appointment. \n\nHey Sarah - you were 15 min late for MY appointment and I didn't say a word about that. What about the 30-45 min you spent dealing with the unusual car accident?  Don't blame the customer and try to make me feel bad for those things.  Plus she dropped color on me when she ran out to help the car accident people. Hey - thanks.\n\nThe biggest problem of all here is that I've spoken to Sarah since and asked her if she could fix my hair since it appears no color took. She was cold, aloof, and basically said she'd fix it for FULL price. What?? Seriously?  I've never had such a horrible reaction from a stylist or a salon in 30 years of getting my hair done professionally.  On top of this, she charged me way more than the price listed on the board for a partial or even a full highlight, but wouldn't explain why. I let it go and still tipped her 20%. When I got home and dried my hair, I realized I had essentially been ripped off. \n\nSarah also made a big deal of my long consult and said she normally charges for consults. I've have never been charged for a consult in connection with getting a service done.  Maybe this is where the 'extra' charge for my color comes from. Who knows.  Sarah was unwilling to budge and was completely unaccommodating.  NO customer service with this one.  The whole time I tried to be pleasant and understanding, but this treatment is ridiculous. I asked for the salon owner to call me to discuss further - guess what - she never called me.\n\nThis salon needs to come with a warning - they are greedy and are looking to make money w/o providing quality service. If you have a problem with a service - forget about compromise - you won't find it here. \n\nI'm making it my goal to fight this to the nth degree. I'm tired of getting ripped off. I don't make a lot of money in my job. I feel like I walked in to a salon, was robbed of $135.00 and told to get the heck out.  Please don't go to this salon if you want to be treated properly, especially for the prices they charge and the lack of quality you will receive."
0,"Pros:\n*People are nice.\n*Complementary water bottles.\n*Large room.\n*Decent sized refrigerator.\n*Rustic look.\n*Apartment-like layout.\n*Back patio.\n*Close to downtown Scottsdale.\n\nCons:\n*If you're from out of town and don't have a car, be prepared to hike to your room (luckily we had a car).\n*Unnecessary resort fee. \n*Rooms are old. The bathrooms could use a tile upgrade and new shower curtains. The curtains have rips and don't appear to be very clean.\n*There were big clumps of dust under the bed and behind the TV.\n*Couldn't open the curtains to let light into the room because they were dirty - had flies and mold on them.\n*There was a random razor under the chair.\n*Old, small, box television set.  \n\nAdditional Comments: Do not pay full price on their website. I cannot believe they charge over $100 per room, per night. I'm please we got a great deal on Hotwire, but I'm not happy to see that many people have experienced bugs (even cockroaches-yuck). We didn't experience cockroaches (as far as I know) but based on the cleanliness of the rooms, I could totally see how this would be possible. If you're just there to sleep and shower, it's an okay place to stay. If you're a little squeamish about things being dirty or having to deal with potential bugs, I would stay somewhere else. On the 2nd night, we forgot to unlock out door for the cleaning service to come in so we had to make a call at midnight for a sheet change. They were quick, but the guy helping us couldn't find the correct sheet size/type for our bed and just gave us a random one to cover the top. The sheets were falling apart all night. I find it odd that they couldn't find even ONE clean sheet, the correct size, to supply us with."
0,"After a fun afternoon chasing my friend's toddler around the big amazing park in the Meadows, we were feeling pretty hungry. As my pal is very picky, and bambinos aren't welcome everywhere, we decided to pop down to George Street and the HRC. I'm not sure why I agreed to it, because the handful of times I've been I've found the food to be distinctly sub-par but I thought maybe I was just ordering the wrong things.\n\nFirst up: service. Friendly: but very, very, slow. It took a while for the waitress to take our drinks order, another while for the grown ups drinks to arrive (Pepsi of course, we were in charge of a wee one), and another five minutes for the little one's apple juice.  \n\nIt was quite difficult to stop him stealing his mum's Pepsi, before his juice arrived; running around causing chaos is thirsty work!\n\nFor the mains, Sarah had ordered the twisted mac and cheese as usual. I decided to go for the pulled pork sandwich because I've heard the pulled pork in HRC is dead good and I'd recently eaten a fabulous pulled pork bun at the Bread Street Brasserie that I hadn't stopped thinking about since.\n\nOf course, this took ages to arrive too. Cue wee man looking at the tables around us and shouting \""MMMM!\"" (his way of saying \""that looks tasty, feed me\"") before jamming a yellow crayon into his mouth that his mother then had to fish out. Ah the joys of parenthood.\n\nUnfortunately for me (but happily for my waistline) the pulled pork simply wasn't up to scratch. It was dry and bland, and I choked down half of it before waving the white flag. The chips (sorry, fries) weren't that great either, totally average, and very dry.\n\nWe weren't offered ketchup, and our waitress did a speedy disappearing act after dropping our plates on the table so I wasn't able to ask her for any.\n\nI mean it wasn't the worst meal I've had in my life, but since I've been a handful of times before and always left disappointed I'll take this as a sign that I shouldn't go back in a hurry. Or ever. The presentation and preparation of the food doesn't justify the price, either.\n\nThere are so many better places to eat on George Street, never mind Edinburgh. Give this gimicky tourist trap a wide berth. \n\nUnless you're in for the cocktails: now there's a different story..."
1,"Took my car in for a repair a few years ago. This time I needed some major work done and seemed to remember a great, honest experience from years ago, so I figured I would try them again. I was not disappointed. Great customer service, very fair pricing, professional, courteous...I will only consider them for all repair needs in the future. Highly recommended!"
0,"I'm not sure what the appeal is here.\n\nFood was ok, but nothing that justified the prices.  Quality wise a certain hamburger chain from Cali produces a burger just as good, if not better, at about a third of the cost.\n\nThis is one of those places with high ceilings and exposed industrial cooling ducts which I expect is supposed to give the place a certain \""look.\""  Ok...that's nice but if you don't dust and clean all that stuff it starts to look reeeeeaaaaallllllyyyyyy baaaaddddd.  Moreover when I see dust/web chunks the size of a quarter hanging from the chain that suspends the lights I keep waiting for one of those dust/web chunks to detach and land in my food.  Note that the menu has all kinds of up charges for more this, extra that...I didn't see one for the dust/web chunks so I expect if you get one in your food its free.\n\nNothing special, I've tried it, won't be back."
0,"Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" Three stars would be \""A-OK,\"" which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.\n\nIt's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.\n\nI have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those."
1,The food was great and service was fast.  Place was very busy on a Wednesday evening and they accommodated us for 3 without any reservations.  Highly recommend making this a stop while in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.
1,"I've had pets my whole life and my observation has been that when the 's front desk staff is nice and proffesional , the doctors are not and when the doctors are great, the front desk leaves much to be desired.  This was not the case at Alta Vista.  First off, there hours are great.  Secondly. the front desk people (Sam), the techs and the doctor (Dr. Sean Penn), very friendly and courteous.  And finally, the price was reasonable. That, along with the place being clean and not smelling like wet dog when you walk in made having to take my dog in on a Sunday afternoon as pleasant as could be.  So far so good."
1,Thanks AL :) Friendly service:)
1,"Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am."
1,"came into town one day after one of those \""lets go to vegas tomorrow!!!\"" nights...\n\nluckily we had some friends that were locals, and they brought us to this quaint, yet sexy lil tapas spot right off the strip.\n\nFIREFLY.\n\nit was a saturday night, and it was busy.  we kicked it at the bar while waiting for a table.  finally got seated and was treated to a wide selection of tapas.  came here with a pretty good sized group so i got to sample a little bit of everything.  lets just say... lets just SAY... LETS JUST SAY EVERYTHING WAS DELISH!!!\n\na month later i was back in vegas, and guess where i took my friends...YOU GUESSED IT!\n\nto the massage parlor!!! jk... (ok half serious)\n\nbut before that we went to FIREFLY!!\n\npretty much just what i expected, excellent."
0,"This place was so disappointing with their food, the service and even their decor. I had eaten here a few times so I was looking forward to eating here again and boy was it a let down. We ordered our drinks, I order a Tempranillo wine. I take a sip of it and it tastes just like vinegar! ugh. The waiter happens to walk by and hears me... He asked \""you don't like it?\"" I replied \""No, this tastes like it's been opened for a few days and it tastes like vinegar now.\"" He replies with \""Do you know what vinegar tastes like?\"" I looked and him and said \""Yes, just like your wine.\"" Needless to say he brought a new bottle to the table and had me try it before pouring a glass... what a difference! It was yummy!\n\nNow onto the flavorless food! Two of us ordered the tortilla soup. It was cool how they poured the broth into a bowl that had all the ingredients. However maybe this is why it lacked in flavor... it didn't have time to marinade. We added all kinds of items, salt, pepper, salsa to make it taste better! The ceviche was so bland too... no taste of seasonings or marinades not even lemon which is what you mostly marinade the fish/prawns in. The mole con pollo should have been written \""Pollo con mole\"" cus it was all chicken and a small trace of mole. My friend ordered a side of mole and poured it in... added salsa, salt and pepper and then it was ok tasting.  \n\nThe service... lets just say our waiter was non existent. We were going to order a round of shots but he never came back to see if everything was ok or if we wanted drink refills. When he finally showed up we just asked for the bill. Never again."
0,"Overpriced place. I dont know were to start..  the staff look nice at first but are not really, when you ask them about their german or swedish dishes they get rude and impatient?? it takes ALOT of time for the food to be ready, plan to be there at least for 1h30mins!! anyways the food is okay but 18$ for a burger not really worth it. second time a ordered a \""pizza\"" wich was 6\"" x 3\"" tomatoes and cheese for 21$? expected way more than a regular pizza! and dont expect proper customer service at all"
1,Nice place to hang out and grab some food and drink.  I like to sit at the bar.  My favorite is the hot chick chicken sandwich.  I love their skinny crispy fries.
0,"I bought a number of items there. among them there was\n- 1 item off the floor it wasn't delivered on schedule no biggie\n- 1 entry door with transom ($500)\n- 1 custom window $1,200.\n\nThe style of the door and the transom didn't match, I called and was told \""that's what you ordered\"" . Really I asked for mismatched styles? I ordered for the lightest clearest low-e glass available, I got the dark type of glass that's recommended for Fla, Nm, Az etc. \"" That's what you ordered\"" was the response again. \n\nThey don't even bother to ask what was shipped or what you ordered, they don't want to know because CYA is the order of the day.\nThen when you go over your buyer's order you realize that regardless of the conversation you had with their salesperson the printed order is so vague that they could ship you anything at all and claim that's what you ordered. My contractor bought my siding there, it's an off-brand and the quality doesn't impress. \nReally shoddy practices\n\nI ordered the rest of the windows ( Andersen) from The Plywood Mart although they won't match these and they were more expensive, that shows how I feel about sponsoring this store again"
0,"Do not come here if you want fast service.\nA few teammates and I came here for a quick bite to eat, and we only had an hour. At 5:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday, it was pretty dead and we expected to get in and out quickly. After being seated, our waiter was no where to be seen. After 10 minutes, I was forced to notify the hostess that we had not been greeted by anyone yet. It took another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive (2 sodas and a water), and they were not even correct. When our food came out, I was served an entire salad when I specifically said a side salad with my steak. After realizing his mistake when inputting the order (because he didn't write it down), my correct order was put in. By the time my steak was served to me, my friends had already finished and I had no choice but to box the whole thing up because of our time constraint. It took FOREVER to get our checks, and after looking at mine, they charged me for the steak meal AND the salad meal! I paid in cash to hopefully speed the process up because it was already past our hour time limit. When the waiter came back, he told me there wasn't any change left in the drawer and that he had to get the manager to go in the safe to get more change for the register. At this point, I told him to just keep the change and we were out of there.\nForever."
0,"Probably the worst chipotle location I have ever been to. I'm a big fan of chipotle don't get me wrong but this location is awful.\n\nThe service is slow, the staff aren't very attentive, and the girl that made my burrito was useless. As soon as I started to open the foil wrap the burrito started falling apart. In the end it's really not that big of a deal but if I wanted a burrito bowl I would have ordered one.\n\nProbably the worst part about this location is the wait time to get your food. The dining area is never all that busy but the line is always at least 15 to 20 mins long. The staff just move slowly plain and simple. \n\nI will continue to enjoy chipotle, but I don't think I will be returning to this location again, not worth it."
1,"Even though this place is a good 20 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale, it's well worth it once you get there.  My wife and I dined there last year while in town for a wedding at the nearby Boulders resort (Excellent btw).  After one trip to Spotted Donkey, we were already planning our next trip back to Scottsdale just to go back.  Well, the golf and spa were other factors but I will travel for good food.  So our next trip was about a month ago and our two visits did not disappoint.\n\nBe sure to try the guacamole.  Although it's $10.50, it's really good.  HINT: order it without one of the ingredients like onions and they will make a fresh batch.  The second time we went, we forgot to order it without onions and it didn't taste as good.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin, which is served over a bed of mac and cheeese and green chiles.  It's delicious and large enough for two meals.  \n\nEven if you think it's too far to drive for dinner, the beautiful town of Carefree will give you that Arizona experience you know you want and get you away from the urban feel of Scottsdale."
0,"I'm torn...what to say about Shitbay..well guess I'm not too torn..okay my wife and I went here 6 month back and the need to review my experience has been haunting me since then. I'll make this short and sweet..The food was wonderful but..big but..my wife is not a sushi eater, she went with me for me..we ordered the large course dinner..at one point, we received some sushi and my wife asked the waitress for some soy and wasabi..now granted this is a gourmet restaurant...but still when one is paying hundreds of dollars for food they should get what they want?? So the server,bless her heart, went to ask the chef( and looked worried I might add) for these items..we were sitting at the bar..The chef looks at her and said \""no way\""..then looks at my wife and yells \""NO WAY!\"" Then turns away..glad there were no samurai swords on the wall!!! My wife started crying (more from embarrassment). .I immediately got up had a word with the manager and he replied \""sorry that's just the way he is!\"" Worst dining experience of my life!"
1,Great place! \n\nFood was excellent. Some of the best HK style food I've had. Service was great and the food came out fast. \n\nI highly recommend it if you need a break from all the buffets!\n\nI'm definitely coming back on my next trip to vegas!
0,"We must have really hit an off night. I found this restaurant to be absolutely nothing special considering all of the wonderful dining options in Las Vegas.  After reading all of the wonderful  reviews I expected it to be great.  I'm disappointed that I wasted a mail while I was in town on this restaurant. \n\nIt's hard for me to say even specifically what I had to eat because it was that unmemorable.  We were a table of four and started with a sushi appetizer. Nothing special, no great flavors, definitely not a  standout.  I had a steak dish that wasn't great either. The drinks were fine,  and in the beginning we considered ordering desert because we saw the elaborate plates they were being served on.   After we finished our entr\u00e9es we definitely changed our minds and decided to skip it..\n\nThis restaurant is pretty damn pricy for what you get.   Unmemorable and over rated."
0,"I recently moved to AZ and I needed new tires so I went to this Sears Auto Center. I've had great experience with Sears Auto in the past, but this one was not up to par. My tire service took 7 hours. Turns out, they broke my TPMS light and couldn't fix it...I went back twice after that initial time and spent countless hours both there and at my dealer to get it reset and they still couldn't fix it. Blamed it on a program issue and not having updated software to fix it. Needless to say, I spent way too much time here, got passed off too many times and got nothing accomplished. My dealer ended up taking care of the problem. Won't be back."
0,Terrible location. Just a couple girls gossiping about their crappy relationships. Totally inattentive  and irritating. Store looked in a disarray. I WILL NOT spend my money here. They didn't even acknowledge my presence.
0,"Ug! Having spent time in the Philippines I thought it would be awesome to eat here.  That was an unfortunate mistake I shant make again! Not even nostalgia could save this train wreck.\n\nThe food:\nGarlic chicken and pancit (noodles) side seemed like they were made yesterday - dry and nasty.  The halo-halo (sweet ice dessert with gelatin and other various mix-ins)  was awful too.  The only thing I got that was any good were the Buchi (sesame balls) but they were way overpriced, and a mango shake that was pretty good.\n\nThe service:\nI think the woman that rang me up was a manager and she was so rude right off the bat I should have left but I was hoping to bring back some good memories with tasty grub. DEFINITELY should have believed the previous two posts.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
0,"This place makes me realise that there is tremendous business potential for another Indian grocery store in the Chandler area. The owners hit the jackpot with the location and that is why they take every liberty to dole out substandard groceries. \n\nThe expiry date is never mentioned on the packaging and if it is, it is usually wrong. The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus. On another occasion we bought some solidified pickle. There have been innumerable disappointments but we kept going back because there was no other option nearby. \n\nThe first lesson that we learn in a Marketing class is that 'the customer always wins' and for now I have decided to shift my purchases to another store in Tempe."
1,"OK, so it's been almost a year, and felt this review was worth of a +1 star update! \n\nMy Coach and I were ousted (OK, more like had our training slots cut from the schedule) from the gym a few doors down. Ended up training closer to home in Chandler, which is much more convenient when you lift/workout 3-4 times each week.  \n\nWell, three of the coaches ended up opening up their own gym, so once again, I find myself in Maricopa one day a week. \n\nSwung by Honeycutt Coffee last Saturday for a post workout iced toddy. Decided to spruce things up with a pump of Salted Caramel and a splash of cream.\n\nI really enjoyed the taste of this. Strong toddy, and the Salted Caramel was decadent without being cloyingly sweet (like Starbucks beverages). \n\nAnother nice barista; enjoyed chatting with this gal. I barely had time to \""Yelp Creep\"" and take photos of the lovely d\u00e9cor before my drink was up! \n\nHoneycutt Coffee is just what Maricopa needed. It's a breath of fresh air compared to all the big coffee chains, and especially in what appears to be just another dingy strip mall. \n\nLook forward to coming back many more weekends with my lifting crew!"
0,Bad service altogether
0,"Wow. And this is not a good wow at all.\n\nDid NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.\n\nThe waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only \""amazing\"" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. \n\nConsidering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to \""work\"" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.\n\nThere seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. \n\nNow, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.\n\nThat's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?\n\nThe waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.\n\nThe one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.\n\nFinal report: More style than substance."
0,"This review is for 10.29.2014.\nWalking this spacious environment, my friend and I were happier and more pleasant after great brunch. \nI tried to reload my card. The agent, Zik (I am not sure about the spelling of his name), was impatient and didn't know how to reload the card. He had to ask 2 other agents for the processing. \nWe presented the promotion code for 25% off via the email with my cell, and again, he failed to process it. After a while of wait, he told us, he couldn't enter the code. Without asking for supervisor's help, he looked at us and said NO. He was obviously not willing or intended to help even we were the only customers in line. We sensed that waiting any longer wouldn't do any good but ruin our day. \nThere were no smiles or greetings, no asking my name or choice on the milk, and no name on my cup the entire wait or purchase.\nA beautiful day-off with great hanging out with friends, just ruined by him."
1,Pricey but good. Good pizza and sandwiches.
0,I hate this place. It is way too small. You can't move a MUSCLE. They let too many people in. Just stay downstairs and order some food. Seriously.
1,"Not quite Brooklyn Bridge, but definitely worth a visit.  Menu is expanded from original but not too much.  Crust is the key here, once again close but no cigar!\nWhat to order\nDo's\nPepperoni Pizza-  spicy with curled edges!\nExtra Sauce - crushed tomatoes in Brooklyn\nExtra fresh basil - \""trust me Joshua you'll know!\""\n\nPesto Pizza - nice change\n\nCalzone - red sauce with at least mushrooms\n\nDont's\nJust one topping... Don't over think it!  At Grimaldi's less is more.  Go single topping on pizzas...focus on the simplicity of the pie!\n\nIt's not Mozza not even Pitfire but it is still damn good!"
1,"I came here with Nicolette after we saw Cirque du Soleil for a late dinner, and to get our parking validated.\n\nSince it was a Wednesday they were playing trivia, which probably starts somewhere around 9-9:30. We got there after the second round of 4, so we just played along, but not competitively, which was disappointing because they looked like they had some pretty great prizes. \n\nOn Wednesdays they have $3 drafts. They also have Woodchuck on draft, so I was pretty excited. \n\nI ordered the chicken and cheese sliders, which have just chicken, bacon, and cheese. Doesn't that sound really good? Well it was. I ate 2 of them (they come with 4) and took the rest home for my husband to enjoy. \n\nNicolette ordered a massive burger with a lot of things on it, and a salad, that never came out. When she told our waitress, she immediately brought it out, and took it off the bill. It was a lot of food, but it was good for me because my sliders didn't come with a side, so I got to partake in Nicolette's fries. They were good, but could have been cooked longer, because they were kind of on the mushy side. \n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun here, and if you can play trivia on a Wednesday, I would come out and have some fun!"
1,Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I just wish they carried pico de gallo or red sauce.
0,"I've received massages from QUA, The SPA at Encore and Wynn, The Bathhouse, Aria, and The Four Seasons Spa. I've always justified the price because they are always some of the best massages I've ever had. The massage I received yesterday from Oleksandra Spa was terrible. All I felt that was accomplished was oil being smeared all over my body.  The two parts I specified to be worked on she DID NOT EVEN TOUCH.  It was bizarre.  I've called the manager a few times and left voice mails and haven't heard back. Definitely not worth going to because of the poor service. Spend your well earned money at QUA."
0,"I was a long time customer. Not any more. \n\nI understand that there has been some apparent issues with your prior office manager; however, making that your customer's problem is bad business practice. \n\nApparently I was never billed for January and June. That is so long ago and now I have to pay those invoices and what we expected to be a monthly service apparently is an every 4 weeks service so I was charged twice in September. That wouldn't have been so bad if these sudden other invoices didn't suddenly come up as well making the amount due way too much. \n\nWe've been a customer for 2 years and even moved and recommended you to the buyers of our old house and kept you with this one. From the below reviews it seems that quite a few customers have been lost, including us, to the errors. I hope other customers situations are handled better. It really stinks because the actual service performed was great. Absolutely no complaints and we had a beautiful lawn."
1,"What a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The beer list is extensive and amazing!  There is something on there for everyone, whether or not you are a beer lover.  The food is equally amazing- the steamed mussels are one of my favorites.  It's a fun, energetic atmosphere.  I always make sure to hit this place up whenever I am in town."
1,"For starts...NO CRAFT BEER...IN DOWNTOWN PHX?!?!  Haha I ran into the owner and asked him about it. He recommended a good beer from Italy. \n\nI got a delicious pizza and the cheese ball deals, both were amazing. I don't know why I've seem elite members on yelp rate this place wayyyy below than where it should be.\n\nLast I got a canoli. The shell was deep fried (out of the ordinary) again, delicious! \n\nHats off to the owner and the crew. The one lady who was our server, eh, could do better. More personable."
0,"Never, never again!!  First of all... The only reason why I came to this buffet was for convienence I was staying at Bally's and it was just one hotel over.  \n\nThe food, sucks!  I was there on a Saturday for their lunch brunch and the selections sucked!!  There was not one good thing to eat.  The food was disgusting.  \n\nOne positive thing... The dessert's were good.  \n\nDONT COME HERE.  TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
0,"I was expecting a lot, from reading previous reviews.  The noise factor was very off-putting.  As we entered, about noon, the music was booming. There is nothing soft around to absorb sound, so don't expect to have a conversation.  The music did tone down after a bit...but not because they lowered it.  Everyone who does talk has to raise his voice to be heard, so the sound escalates as the restaurant fills.  I had to put in the earplugs I always have with me.  My chicken pot pie used puff pastry underneath and on top of the filling.  The filling was okay; I didn't detect a lot of chicken in it, but it wasn't all sauce like some--mostly veggies I think.  The bottom crust couldn't be crispy, and the top crust wasn't either--so I just ate arouond the edges.  The chicken sandwich was ordinary, and the potato salad tasted more like the packaged salad in a regular market.  The one I make myself is much better.  It's unlikely we will return.  Breakfast is enticing, but ends at 11 am."
1,"The driver, Daniel, was early to the pickup, so there was no pressure on the drive. He was courteous and helpful. I called other cabs to compare prices and they were by far the cheapest to the airport. Great value indeed!"
0,Ate here before seeing Terry Fator. This is my first time eating at this chain. I was NOT impressed. Freschetta FROZEN pizza tasted better than this place. The prices were ridiculous. For the same price I would rather go to Settebello's. They are the BEST pizza in town! Save your money and forgo California Pizza Kitchen.
0,"I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.\n\nI ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's. \n\nI do not plan on returning to this restaurant"
0,Happy hour now sucks. Only 1 beer per month on special. Next time I'll go next door to O2. New untrained waitress had to go ask someone every question I asked her.
1,This is one of the better places in Charlotte for good food and nice atmosphere.  The food is above average to great depending on what you get.  I like the Salmon.  There is also a nice outdoor space during the warmer months.
1,"Came here on a random Friday night after bookmarking it awhile ago after seeing the glowing reviews. When we pulled up via pedicab, we realized this was the place they had been working on the last time we ventured into SquashBlossom. The patio area looked nice but it was way too hot that night to sit outside so we opted for the dinning room.\n\nWhen we walked in, the place was nearly full but we were greeted and sat near the back wall at a small table. Our waitress was friendly and we both ordered cocktails that were really good. We opted to get the Focaccia bread as an appetizer and then share the Mango Salad and Peppino pizza. I requested that the Mango salad be made with other greens besides arugula. As I mentioned in the Zpizza review, since when has this crappy, peppery green become so fashionable?!?! If I want my salad to taste like an herb, I'll add it, thank you very much. When I asked for a substitution with one of the other greens listed on the menu, our waitress said they couldn't really do it, that the salads were pre-made. I probably should have opted for a different salad but she said it was a blend so I thought I could probably overlook it if there wasn't a lot of it.\n\nWe received a basket of bread that was just okay in flavor. It was nice and soft though and at first I thought it was the Focaccia appetizer but then it arrived, nearly taking up our whole table! It wasn't quite what I had expected though. It was definitely flatbread that had been baked but the waitress advertised it as being able to be dipped in their homemade vinegar and oil. That's what sold me on it so I had expected some bread that actually soaked up the oil. If you've ever had a salad at Gelato spot, it was a lot like their bread under their salads. Picture a really big, baked tortilla. There's not a lot there to soak up anything. \n\nOur salad came out next. Sadly, 10% was baby lettuce and the rest arugula. Everything else on this salad was really good but the arugula overpowered every other flavor. I wouldn't get it again and it would be nice if restaurants stopped serving this crap but I digress...\n\nBy the time we were done with our salads, our table was overflowing with dishes, drinks, bread, appetizers, water glasses, oils. It was almost claustrophobic. We ended up setting several things on the floor so we didn't dump anything. The place is tiny so they can't have massive tables but it would be helpful if the staff paid a bit more attention to how much they put on our table and keeping it clear. \n\nNow for the reason for the 4 stars. The PIZZA. It was sooooo good. Everything was super fresh. The cheese, the ricotta, the sauce, the sausage! This was probably the best tasting sausage I've ever had on a pizza. We devoured the entire thing like it was going to be snatched from us at any moment. It blows Pizzeria Bianco out of the water and eases out over Cibo with the crust and sauce and toppings just slightly.\n\nOnce we sufficiently stuffed ourselves with pizza, the head chef came by our table and gave us each a shot of Limoncello that was super strong and really good and some odd fried dough of some sort with powdered sugar. All compliments of the house. The dough was tasteless though so maybe they were just trying to give it away? I do appreciate the effort though. The chef was nice enough to bring it over but definitely wasn't overly friendly, smile or even thanked us for our business. \n\nEven after all the other faults of this place, I'm still thinking about that pizza and its been a few weeks since we visited. I'll have no problem going back. Hopefully very soon!"
1,"Good food and big portions! I usually get their burger, which is very filling. It has a nice, casual atmosphere."
0,"This one gets zero stars. I may be off but 24 hour shuttle usually means you have a shuttle that goes back and forth from the airport throughout the day.  No such shuttle appeared.  Ended up cabbing it (that's another story - look for Mayflower Cab in Phoenix) an having to make an appointment for the shuttle in the morning. Upon arrival, the worker at the desk was chatting it up with some person who looked like he had nothing better to do at 11:20 pm but hang out at this ghetto ass hotel. When we interrupted their conversation, we weren't greeted, no smile, nothing. Finally get checked in and make our way up to the room. Absolute bare bones, which we paid for. At least the place seemed clean to the naked eye. Who knows what a black light would have revealed.\n\nUpon check out, Mr. Hospitality was still working the front desk.  We were walking in just as he was walking out with the coffee thermos. He could have taken care of us first then the coffee later. Nope. Coffee more important. He comes back carrying two pitchers of juice and a tray of pastries (both hands full). He bangs the tray into the window and sneers at us as if to say, \""Open the door for me.\""  We checked out quickly and were happy to get out of there. Thankfully the shuttle was there already. (Run by a third party)\n\nRecommendation: never stay here. Ever. For any reason. Sleep in your car. Days Inn should take away their license to use the company name. I've stayed at a lot of hotels and a wide array of them. This is by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. \n\nThey only get one star because yelp requires it."
1,"The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!  \n\nIt's a really great place for kids, especially with these little booth rooms.  The food didn't really leave an impression on me, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though, it can't all be good."
0,Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
1,I love how friendly everyone is and they have the best beds that give the best color in town
0,"Yep, from five stars to one! It appears that this clinic is only courteous when you have a bottomless Scottsdale wallet. Otherwise, they browbeat you into feeling like the worst pet owner ever, even when faced with an Impossible end-of-life situation. \n\nThis update is written two years after the beloved pet in question passed away, so is by no means a grief-stricken, heat-of-the-moment review. For compassionate care, I now recommend Scaredy Cat."
0,"I'm not disappointed by the hour and a half it took me to talk to a technician, and I'm not disappointed by how anybody treated me there. What I am very disappointed by, however, is the new norm of an Apple product experience. About 1 year and 3 months ago I purchased a brand new Macbook Air. Previously I had owned a black Macbook and had no problems with it in 5 years of ownership. It was by far one of the best products I've ever owned\n\nI spent a lot of money on the Air and expected it to be just as durable as my previous computer. Fast forward to today (90 days out of warranty) and I got the service battery notification- so either something was terribly wrong or the battery was just oddly low on juice in its lifetime.\n\nAfter the wait, the technician told me that although my battery had only really used up one fifth of its 1,000 charge lifecycle that it was verging on failure and my RAM was not recognizing her OS and that could mean an entire logic board replacement. \n\nThankfully it only turned out to be the former after a 36 hour wait. I talked to someone at Apple on the phone and they told me it would cost $129 to replace the battery. I refuted that although this computer was 90 days out of warranty the technician told me it was the battery at fault and would prefer it be replaced for free (I also saw this was a very common issue for other owners of the same model).\n\nLong story short, as nice as possible the person on the other end of the line told me they would not replace it for free. I tried again with another person, and they wouldn't budge either.\n\nI told them I was disappointed they wouldn't stand behind their products as products that should last, and I am seriously considering not buying another Apple product.\n\nApple products used to stand for superiority in quality, service and reliability. But recently as they've made their lines increasingly proprietary and only serviceable under Apple they have no incentive to make things last. Now you just ditch the old and buy the new at ridiculous cost or have it repaired at an absurd premium by Apple, or spend way too much money on their warranty to get that extra piece of mind.\n\nI had a similar issue with my iPhone 5, when the sleep/wake button stopped working. When I looked it up online, I noticed it was a common problem that is fixed even when you're outside of your warranty. So I went to the Apple store, and they claimed that because my phone had a dent it was not eligible to be fixed for free and wanted $170 for the repair. That's like saying because someone broke the mirror on your car it wouldn't be eligible for a recall for an airbag. Absurd.\n\nIt's really disappointing to see a company that used to be focused on the quality and durability of its products instead focused on extracting more money from customers and watering down the ownership experience It's a shame, really. I no longer think of Apple as a company that builds durable products.\n\nI don't think I can give up the Mac experience, as I've had one for so long and don't like how PCs function, but I absolutely will not be buying another Apple tablet or mobile device. And while I am buying another Mac, the quality of Apple's products and support has seriously gone downhill. I've never had as little confidence in a product being long-lasting and durable. And with the horrible software issues they have with every release, like when the Wi-Fi on my Mavericks upgrade would stop working all the time, or my iPhone would reset with the new iOs release, you have to wonder, where is the Quality Assurance testing?\n\nI think there are too many good options out there when it comes to mobile devices, and I'd spend my money elsewhere."
0,"I haven't been back to a Chili's in a long time and when we were given a gift card after moving to Pittsburgh we decided to use it. Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up. \n\nI will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime. \n\nThe ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food."
1,"The PAT buses aren't nearly as bad as many Pittsburghers make it to be. People complain about having to do transfers downtown, etc... - The reality is, it a decent system!! They could have more frequent rotations of buses at different routes, but Pittsburgh's public transportation - the buses, the T, etc... is a good system that works well for a city that is built on some mountains with a poor lay out of roads, etc... its not going to run as efficiently as areas that are built on a grid system that makes logical sense - its more difficult to get around everything. Gotta give them some slack!! and The bus drivers have always been great too!"
1,Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!
1,Sure you get what you pay for.  It is probably the best value in Vegas -- if fanciness is not high on your priorities.  It feels like a family place.  Casino is fine.  Buffet is a little lame but we always go to the Peppermill anyway.
1,"Okay so my boyfriend and I stayed here Tuesday through Thursday. \nValet is EXTREMELY polite and welcoming. \nThe line was short to check in. \n\nWe got free tickets to the buffet.\nLet's just say, good thing it was free.  \n\nOur room was the Spa Suite. \nI loved everything about it. \n\nThe bathroom had it's own separate door for the toilet, which was great.\n\nThe hot tub was HUGE! \nI recommend bringing bubbles. It gets really fun. \nThe hot tub is just next to the window to enjoy a view while having a drink. \nThey also have little jets inside the hot tub that are so relaxing. \n\nThe couches were uncomfortable--stiff. \n\nThe kitchen was nice. \n\nThe AC is spectacular. It actually really works. \n\nThe food court has a great variety.\n[subway, McDonald's, sbarro, Chinese food, rubios, chicken tenders]\n\n\nMonte Carlo, you sure did satisfy our needs. \nBy far my favorite hotel on the strip now. \n\nWould have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like you should update your lamps to have an outlet to charge your phone. \nAnd also, the bottom sheet under the bed, [the \""skirt\""] was dirty. Looked like vomit. :/ \n\nBut other than that, I loved it all."
0,Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4.
1,"First of all, this place is phenomenal.  I have a membership to the Morrison (close to work), but decided to come try out Dowd on the weekend since it's so close to my house.\n\nI walked in and asked where the cardio machines are.  The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor.  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  \n\nThe Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven?!\n\nNeedless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.  They had everything I needed right there!  \n\nWhat a wonderful place!  I will definitely be back!"
1,"Needing seafood, we decided to look up agauchiles on yelp. We came across a little spot off the strip and decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with customer service and of course the food was phenomenal. You must try the shrimp empanadas! Great after a long night of drinking. Another plate that was very tasty was the mojara a la diabla. Great taste and very filling. Oh and let's not forget about the aguachiles they were excellent! So if you're in Vegas come give this place a try!"
0,"We will never, ever be back.  We even talked with the GM about the service and he seemed to not care one bit about how we were treated or the service that was given.  We waited an entire hour to get our food and then it was cold.  We did send it back and it came back just warm.  The GM said that they were just way to busy tonight even though we saw others being served and finished even before we received our food.  The waitress was even worse, if that is possible.  Do yourself a favor, stay away!!!  \n\nIf I owned the bar, I would fire the GM first thing in the am.  As for how horrible the waitress was, I would also blame the GM for that as well.  Totally unacceptable.  \n\n\nStay away!"
1,"My family and I have been eating here for years.  It is a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall location.  The food is always consistently great and the salad you get with your entree is the best.  Also, the garlic bread is amazing.  Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of inhaling here are the lasagne, chicken saltinboka, fetachini alfredo, linguini carbonara, linguini and clam sauce, sausage and peppers, oh I could go on and on.  Also, they have a small bar which is dark and relaxing."
1,"My sweetie and I came here for our anniversary.  The management took better care of us than we could have ever dreamed. Staff, food, view... all amazing. Highly recommend! We'll be back again!"
0,"Go anywhere else to eat!!!!\n\nI came here during a lay over at the Charlotte Airport.  As soon as I sat down and opened the container, I regretted it.  The food just looks overprocessed and gross.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao chicken and rice.  They didn't even have regular white rice, only fried.  Way too heavy of a meal when you're about to sit on another airplane for another 4 hours.\n\nThe food was absolutely disgusting.  I took 2 bites and threw it away.  I can't believe I wasted $10 on this crap.  \n\nI then walked over to BK for a $1.75 cheeseburger that tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump."
0,I'm an avid sushi eater and this place is a hole in the wall that you DO NOT want to spend your money on. Got the all you can eat for an hour. The waitress was an older Filipino lady who seemed really bothered to take our order. She came around twice and we never saw her again. We couldn't even utilize the all you can eat because no one was around and we weren't the only ones complaining that night.We said f-it and left. Went to complain and the guy that took our money couldn't speak English. There are way better sushi spots in Vegas. Don't waste your time here.
1,"Just when I thought I couldn't love NY Flavor any more than I already do, Bill and Lynn along with Chef Craig top themselves again. Now they are offering a 10% discount to anyone who shows their PTA Membership card. So not only do they make delicious foods at decent prices and are the friendliest, cleanest restaurant in Surprise, they are embracing the community to help out our schools, parents, and kids by joining the ranks of the largest child advocacy organization in the country! What's not to love about this place???"
1,"A wonderful restaurant experience, a super friendly staff in a beautiful industrial decor.  The open kitchen gives the whole place a special touch.\n\nBut above all a stunning food, there are always new items on the menu that keep surprising us. A must try in Montreal!"
1,"My new most favorite fabulous clothing boutique. We were heading for cocktails and I got sidetracked by this clothing stores window, had to go in.   Game on!!   I'm more of an Internet shopper (bebes, Victorias, Boston proper, nordstroms, etc.) but everything I looked at was a must have item and a perfect fit.   So, I highly recommend my francescas and give this place 5 stars and 3 snaps in the Z formation.  Check it out!!!!"
0,"This review is pertaining to service.\n\nI bought a Streetglide at another shop last year and decided to do modifications. I spent about $3,000 just on parts and service including pipes. \n\nI was saving to buy a house and didn't want to use the money at the time but was talked into it because they said they could give me a discount on the parts. \n\nI took the service manager's (Mike) suggestion to have them put a set of pipes on for which I had no prior personal experience with the pipes of the service manager.  I thought at the time that they would know better than I would.  I was wrong.  Always follow your gut feeling.!  \n\nI noticed popping after the pipes were installed. I had told them I had had issues with popping on other non-Harley bikes and definintely didin't want that to happen.  I was sure to state this before I bought the pipes. After going back at least 4-5 times for the same issue and being told that the popping shouldn't be an issue because that's just what Thunder Headers do  by the service manager, I finally went to the Manager of the store.  *I do have to say that Mark, the manager was good about asking what they could do and offered to put other mufflers on the bike.*  However, when I asked the service manager about changing out the mufflers, I was told that all others would still pop.  I chose instead to have another mechanic tune the bike.  \n\nI still have popping after all of this.  I called the dealership about a month ago to let them know it was still a problem because they had told me to call them and let them know.  They told me they wanted me to be happy.  Well, not so much!\n\nI suggest to anyone that is considering going there and making modifications that you get a second opinion.  Don't assume that because they are at Harley, they know your bike or know what is going to work.\n\nIt's very disappointing because I chose a Harley shop rather than other people I was referred to worrying that they might not do a good job."
1,"For the price you pay here, you get a better experience than a similar-priced place on the strip.\n\nI'm in Vegas at least half a dozen times a year, and this has become our go-to place for work stays - the rooms are reasonably quiet, the beds are comfortable, and they have a pool and a fitness center.  You don't have to walk through a casino and a bunch of crappy shops to get to your room.\n\nIf you do want to wander to the strip, it isn't very far - you're a couple blocks from Bally's.  You don't have to go far for good eats off-strip, either, including my favorite place in Vegas, FireFly.  I imagine it would be a good place to base a fun weekend trip.\n\nAlso, as corny as the theme is, it is kind of relaxing to walk from the parking lot through shaded alleys with lots of foliage after a long day of meetings.\n\nOnly downside - there's no wi-fi in the rooms unless you pay, which is ridiculous considering the high resort fee.  You can get free wireless in the public areas, though."
0,"We went here because the building looked really cook and it had a roof deck.  I orderd a chicken bri salad.  It was ok but the salad had 4 ingredients lettuce, chesee, chicken and bacon.  It tasted good but I honestly never had a salad with so little ingredients.  MY girlfriend had a breakfast sandwich with home fries which was small and overpriced.  The view on the roof made this place fun but the food was overpriced for what you got."
0,"Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,"
0,"The food was ok. I received very slow service, and although my waitress was very nice, it was just slow. I didn't get asked what I would like to drink for five minutes after being seated, even though the place wasn't too busy (it was 1am). Also I wasn't even greeted upon entry. It was expensive, and the portions were tiny. I wouldn't mind so much if the service made up for the portions, but it didn't. What was I paying for? Service? No. Food? No. It was disappointing."
0,"If you're in a jam, maybe drop by here to find cover-ups, but beware because there's a lot of hits and misses. \n\nMost cover-ups are overpriced, but I managed to find one that was under $100 and reasonably classy looking. \n\nTheir suits are beautiful, but again overpriced for it's lackluster designs. \n\nThe sales girls are really the most annoying part of the overpriced experience. They're helpful only when it appears that you're willing to pay the exorbitant prices and even then, they are completely uninterested in trying to provide customer service."
1,"First of all, let me preface my review by saying that Jorge and his crew are super nice. My office has worked with them in the past to cater several of our events, one involving 200 people and another 4,000 plus. Considering the mass quantities of food they served, the quality was not compromised. They are willing to accommodate any type of request.\n\nThat said, I've enjoyed their food multiple times at First Friday, and it has all been superb. You must try the sopes, quesadillas, and the fish tacos OMG! They  are phenomenal! Check them out now!"
0,I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere
0,"We had made reservations through Open Table for Pampas at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Upon arriving for our 7pm reservation, we were told that they did not have our reservation and that there is a  waiting list and it will be 20 to 30 minute wait, which turned out to be a 45 minute wait. My thing is if you have reservations then why don't you have a record that you did receive it. They commented and said that it is better to call in your reservation instead of making it on the website or through Open Table website or app. Other than this experience the food and service was very good."
1,"Like chipotle with pizza, it was quick good service and overall pizza was pretty solid. will definitely return!"
1,"This is probably the best coffee shop in Summerlin. It's a bit pricey, but the drinks are solid, and the macaroons are to die for."
0,"I have been here for dinner 6 times over the last year and I keep hoping that the food will get better and it never has , it gets worse every time ... will never go back and I don't recommend to anyone it is expensive for the quality and the tap waterthe serve you warm is terrible ....."
0,"Used this place before and was satisfied with there service for septic wait removal. 7 years later we call to use them again and they charged us twice as much as last time and spent less time draining the septic tank and he was rude and seem to be in a hurry to get on out of there, and we didn't feel like they did not do a good and quality job. 6 month later its full again. And won't help us out with this bad service they did for us.  Would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with."
1,"Fantastic!  Went there with my boyfriend and some friends for drinks and a bite.  I got a veggie burrito (definitely a thumbs up) and an assortment of drinks, all delicious.  You can tell the bartender cares about what he puts together, and it was fun chatting with him before we ate.  The atmosphere is almost trying too hard, but that really only adds to it's charm, as you notice more and more interesting details as you look around (parachute frogs on the vent, etc).  I'm hoping to stop in again very soon to try their veggie nachos or tacos."
1,"I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him."
0,"Bummer...I really tried to love this place. I'm all about supporting local businesses vs. chains, but I won't go back. I've tried this several times and the inconsistency of food quality is a real bummer...\n\nOne visit the burnt ends are crispy, delicious, meat candy and the next visit you're served a bowl full of chunks of beef fat. (Brisket varies along these same lines.) One visit the bbq beans are sweat and tangy with robust flavors and the next they taste like ranch style beans from a can. Just not worth it for the price."
1,"As I prepare to get tires for my car this month, I already know where I'm going - Discount Tire!  I've been their customer since the first time I bought tires there many years ago - I won't go anywhere else, and I tell everyone I know to check them out.\n\nThe customer service is great - they WANT to help me and make sure I get what I need.  Rotations are best scheduled - I suggest the first appointment in the morning in case they get backed up (stuff happens, plus they have coffee!).  They'll happily check tire pressures at any time - they are at a convenient west side location for that.\n\nI appreciate their efforts to get me the best deal I can find.  If I can find a better deal somewhere else, they'll match it. Most often, they BEAT the best price I can find - that makes me feel like a valued customer.  If they don't have your tires in stock, they can get them quickly - often the next day.\n\nQuality service.  Timely service.  Honest people.  Great business."
0,"I used to be a big fan of Flat Top. I used to go there at least once a month. Then the price went up, you had to pay extra for shrimps, so I started going there less frequently. \n\nI went back there again today for a quick late lunch. Flat top lunch used to be a bargain for lunch take out at $7.50. I went there today and upon paying I got a bill for $8.99 even though on the board it says lunch price is $7.99 for students. I talked to one of the waitresses there and she's like that's just how it is, we just raised the price up EVEN THOUGH on the board it clearly says $7.99. I said that's a shady business practice, you can't charge someone extra for something that's not stated on the menu, and she said she can't do anything about it, and that i'll have to go talk to the manager. I talked to the manager, and he said the price just went up. Again, the board (which displays the menu and the price), says $7.99. Once he found out that I was getting a take out, he said oh the student discount is only for dine in. Again, this is not stated anywhere on the board or in the menu. I used to come here a lot, and I always got student discount with take out. \n\nI was not pleased with the tone of the manager and his sketchy business practice, so I just decided to dine in. A new, very nice waiter came by and apologized for everything. she was really nice and was sorry for how I was being treated. She got me the dine in plate and asked if I want to box it to take it home, and that's what I did. \n\nThe extra $1 doesn't mean much. I gave that away as a tip to my amazing waitress. I'm just against shady business practices.\n\nAnd the food? the food is great. Service is usually good. I've dealt with the manager two times, and I felt like he's a rude and shady person."
1,"Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction."
0,"This was actually the first of many venues visited by myself and my fiance (now husband) for our wedding ceremony.  The photos online look amazing, and we were anxious to visit the property.  We called and made an appointment, and arrived a couple of minutes early.  We stood in front of the open door of the office for nearly 20 minutes, all the while the two employees inside (who could clearly see us) joked and laughed.  We finally stepped out back to take a tour ourselves.  \n\nWe were not nearly as impressed as we thought we would be.  The place is in need of major repairs, and the attention to detail just isn't there.  The windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, as they were coated with smears, fingerprints, goop-like substances, and a layer of the desert's dust.  The floor of the main ball room was absolutely disgusting, and the women's and men's bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE (seriously, they smelled like a well-used Port-A-Potty after midnight at an all-you-can-eat deep-fried sausage event).  \n\nWe were just about to walk out the door when one of the two employees who had been jibber-jabbering in the office came to stop us.  When we told her that it was over 30 minutes past our appointment time and we needed to get going, she inquired as to why we just didn't come into her office and sit down.  Really?  So it's our fault that we didn't begin the meeting on time?  We told her that the place just didn't look how we expected it to look. She remarked that they had had a big event the weekend before, and that the place still hadn't been cleaned.  That might be true, but there were things that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!  \n\nFurther, the \""castle\"" is situated in an industrial area which is currently under construction.  If you're planning an event that does not take place in the evening, construction noise is a very real possibility."
0,"Went to Westin for a post-NAB conference.\n\nThey did a great job trying to make it look like a W Hotel inside and in your rooms.
